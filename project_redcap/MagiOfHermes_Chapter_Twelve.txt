''Concept: This magus aims to master fire magic, developing a wide range of new spells and effects, including non-violent applications of this Art.''
''Ranulf of Flambeau was born to a family of candle makers. He could possibly have had a successful life taking up his family’s trade, even considering the drawbacks of his poor vision and the deleterious social effects of The Gift. Instead, he was apprenticed into House Flambeau. Ranulf’s parens passed into a Twilight episode while Ranulf was taking his Gauntlet. Ranulf assumed the title of Hermetic magus after a period of months, with the approval of two other Flambeau magi who had witnessed his successful performance in meeting the challenges set for his Gauntlet. Three years later Ranulf’s parens recovered from her Twilight and demanded that Ranulf repeat his Gauntlet to her satisfaction. Ranulf felt this request to be a slight on his honor. Ranulf’s parens felt that Ranulf’s refusal to repeat the Gauntlet was a slight to her own honor. The two were never reconciled. Ranulf strives to become a great master of the Arts of Ignem and Vim. As an apprentice, he was obsessed with the spell Pilum of Fire and dreamed of becoming a respected and feared hoplite. As he aged, he became less aggressive and particularly interested in nonviolent applications of the Art of Ignem.''

Activities in the last 15 years: In his first fifteen years out of Gauntlet, Ranulf concentrated on studying his Abilities and Arts. He spent a good deal of effort fending off political attacks from his former mentor. Ranulf swore to the code of Garus and joined the Milites society both because he believed in their cause and to gain allies against his former mentor. One matter that he was able to see to was the enchantment of his laboratory. Ranulf decided that magical protections against fire were a necessity for studying Ignem in the wooden room that houses his laboratory. Ranulf has spent one season opening his laboratory for enchantment. He spent one season instilling Eyes of the Acolyte, three seasons instilling Façade of Pentecost, and two seasons instilling Laboratory that Has Learned from Experience.''
''Ranulf expended one season integrating the magical enchantments of his laboratory. Ranulf spent one season inventing Mien of Helios, and three seasons inventing Stockade of Infernos. Ranulf spent two seasons acquiring his longevity ritual from another magus.

===Coat of Prometheus===

''CrIg 5 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind. This spell enchants a person to remain at least comfortably warm regardless of how cold the environment is. Snow immediately melts off of the target’s body, and moisture soon evaporates from both the target and his clothing. The target suffers no ill effects from normal extremes of cold weather. The spell also confers a +5 Soak bonus to resist damage caused by extreme cold, and a –5 Soak penalty to resist damage caused by extreme heat. Ease Factors of rolls to resist the environmental effects of heat are increased by 3 for characters affected by Coat of Prometheus. (Base 2, +1 Touch, + 2 Sun)''

===Mien of Helios===

''CrIg Level 15 R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind This spell causes the caster’s body and personal effects to shine with the brightness of the sun. Anyone within 10 paces of the caster who looks in the direction of the caster is temporarily blinded, unless he makes a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9. People between 10 and 50 paces from the caster suffer a –3 penalty to all attempts to target the caster. The light created by this spell illuminates a great area and, if conditions permit, could be seen from several miles away. Ranulf has noticed that people and creatures whose Magic Resistance is not penetrated by this spell are not illuminated by it, and can be easily identified by their lack of reflected light. (Base 5, +1 Diameter, +1 exceptionally intense light)''

''Pilum of Fire and Other Common Spells''
''Pilum of Fire is a popular spell within the Order of Hermes, and it is especially popular with the faction of Flambeau who follow the School of the Founder. Part of this popularity is due to the rich history of the spell. It was used by many famous magi throughout the Order’s history, and some magi take pride in using the same tool as their forebears. Yet some of the spell’s popularity is actually the result of that popularity itself. This is true not only of Pilum of Fire, but of several common spells within the Order of Hermes. Many readable laboratory texts are available for these spells, and there exist several texts concerning mastery of the spells. In addition, other spells have been developed to be used in conjunction with the common spells, such as a Wizard’s Boost, Maintain the Demanding Spell, or The Patient Spell of appropriate level, and special spells relating specifically to commonly used spells. Even if such spells are not common, an enterprising magus may well be able to strike a bargain with the magi and covenants that posses laboratory texts for these spells, and thereby avoid the effort of inventing them from scratch.''
''An example of a spell specifically tailored to be used with another is Boreal Flames. Certainly a spell to create a jet of icy flames could be developed as a Creo Ignem spell with a Muto requisite, and such a spell could be cast without the Concentration difficulties presented by Boreal Flames. Yet this hypothetical spell would not be able to take advantage of the proficiency that many magi have developed in using Pilum of Fire. A jet of icy flames is useful specifically against targets that are either naturally immune to heat or have become so through protective magics, two sorts of foes that are also likely to have Magic Resistance. Most casters are able to achieve greater penetration with both Pilum of Fire and Boreal Flames (both spells need to penetrate) then they would be able to achieve with a single higher-level spell. While many magi muse that a spell similar to Pilum of Fire with a longer range or with a less-intense flame that would allow better penetration might be better suited to their particular needs, the resources that exist within the Order that specifically relate to Pilum of Fire make it the spell used by magi more often than might be warranted by its utility alone.''

''location touched by the caster. The created fire burns continuously for the duration of the spell with no need for fuel. This spell was created in the early days of the Order, and is common in covenants without a nearby source of firewood. The Fasting Hearth is not frequently used for a magus’ laboratory because of the Warping effects it can have on research conducted under its influence. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)''

===Self Immolation===

''CrIg 30 R: Personal, D: Diam, T: Ind The caster enshrouds himself in flames of spectacular intensity. The flames are hot enough to do +30 damage to anything that the caster touches or that touches the caster, and +30 damage per round to both him and anything that he is holding or that he touches. Ranulf casts this spell upon himself only after casting a spell to protect himself from the heat. (Base 25, +1 Diameter)''

===Stockade of Infernos===

''CrIg 40 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Group The caster creates six walls of fire within the range of his spell. Each wall is up to 10 paces long. These walls can be created in any configuration desired by the caster, including configurations where the walls intersect one another. If a particularly precise placement of the walls is desired, the caster should make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine his success. Using Stockade of Infernos to directly attack a creature by placing a wall of fire across that creature’s location may be accomplished using the rules for aimed spells. Anyone passing through one of the walls takes +15 fire damage. Ranulf frequently places his walls as a set of two concentric triangles, or as a narrow path that leaves people trapped within them only a single direction to move. (Base 15, + 1 Concentration, +2 Group)''

===Conflagrative Servant===

''Cr(Re)Ig 45 R: Voice, D Sun, T Ind This spell creates a four-pace-tall manshaped mass of brightly burning flames. This mass of flames responds to the verbal commands of the caster. Commands have''
''to be very simple, like “follow me” or “wrap yourself around that creature and hold on.” The conflagrative servant is made of fire hot enough to do +5 damage to things that the servant touches or that touch the servant. The conflagrative servant is insubstantial but cannot pass through solid objects. The insubstantial nature of the servant also normally prevents it from manipulating objects. When created, the conflagrative servant has a Size of +3, Strength and Stamina scores of +5 (although it has no substance to touch things), and Dexterity and Quickness scores of –2. The conflagrative servant has no Abilities. The conflagrative servant is subject to damage from Perdo Ignem spells and water. When the conflagrative servant is injured by these means, it shrinks in size. Every size category that the conflagrative servant shrinks, it loses 2 points from its Strength and Stamina scores and gains 1 point in its Dexterity and Quickness scores. The conflagrative servant is extinguished if it shrinks to smaller than a candle flame in size (Size –10). Ranulf frequently casts Flames of Stone upon his conflagrative servants in order to allow them to perform manual labor. This makes the conflagrative servant substantial and vulnerable to physical damage. Any damage done to the conflagrative servant causes it to shrink as detailed above. A Light Wound shrinks the servant one size level, a Medium Wound shrinks the servant two size levels, and so on. Ranulf also frequently uses multiple invocations of Discriminating Flames on the servants to enable them to use tools and enter structures without causing tremendous damage. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 size, +1 requisite, +1 complexity)''

===Enduring Flame===

''MuIg Level 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind A fire targeted by this spell is inextinguishable by wind or water for the spell’s duration. A fire will still burn out if it runs out of fuel while under the effect of the spell, and a candle that is the target of this spell may still be extinguished by being pinched or snuffed out. This spell was originally designed to keep a candle burning on a windy and rainy night, but it can be used on fires that are much larger in size and can even be used to allow a burning torch to be brought underwater without being extinguished. The bubbles, smoke, and turbulence caused by submerging a fire that is under the effect''
''of this spell prevent it from being a useful method of illuminating aquatic areas. (Base 3, +1 Touch, + 2 Sun)''

===Boreal Flames===

''Mu(Pe)Ig 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind. This spell momentarily alters a fire so that rather than radiating heat, it radiates an icy cold. The colors of the target fire change from oranges and yellows to violets and blues. Any fire affected by this spell does cold damage rather than heat damage for the moment of the spell’s duration. Boreal Flames does not function on fires that are so hot that they do more than +15 damage. This spell was specifically designed to alter a casting of Pilum of Fire. Boreal Flames may be cast in conjunction with another spell; to do so the caster must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 15 (per ArM5, page 82). Ranulf uses Boreal Flames in conjunction with The Patient Spell, as doing so eliminates the need for such a formidable feat of concentration. (Base 4, + 1 Touch, +2 intensity of flames)''

===Discourse of Glowing Tongues===

''ReIg Level 10 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind This spell controls the sounds created by a fire to make them form words. The alteration is subtle; words are formed of the natural roar, crackles, and hisses of the fire — not with any additional sound. Someone listening at the fire who knows to expect the words can make them out with a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 3. A character who is not aware that the fire is speaking needs to roll against an Ease Factor of 9 on a Perception + Awareness test to realize that the fire is making words at all. Ranulf and his apprentice (who is also quite talented with the Art of Ignem) use this spell to target fires that are subject to the Unified Flame spell. Because the Unified Flame is cast by Ranulf within his covenant, the communication is not impeded by his covenant’s Aegis of the Hearth. Neither Ranulf nor his apprentice knows Discourse of Glowing Tongues as a formulaic spell; instead, they cast it spontaneously when needed. Note that this spell has a Range of Touch and may be difficult or even damaging to cast on a particularly hot fire. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration)''

===Discriminating Flames===

''ReIg 25 R: Voice, D:Sun, T: Ind This spell controls a fire, preventing it from directly heating or burning a particular substance (such as human flesh or the wood of the elm tree) chosen by the caster at the time of casting. The caster must either have a sample of the material to be protected, or must cast the spell with an appropriate casting requisite. Ranulf frequently casts this spell several times upon the same fire in order to make the fire safe for specific environments. The spell only affects the fire that it is cast upon. Other fires, including fires that have been lit from the subject of this spell, are not affected. Fires up to ten times the size of a hearth fire can be targeted with this spell. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 size)''

===Petite Phoenix===

''ReIg Level 30 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind This transmutes a fire into the shape of a small bird. The reshaped fire moves as the will of the caster directs. The fire has a Size of –6, a Dexterity of +3, and a Quickness of +7. The heat of the original blaze is unchanged by this spell. The bird has no more substance than the original fire did and is not subject to most types of attacks, but still may be extinguished with water, Perdo Ignem magics, and similar methods. Being made entirely of flame, the petite phoenix can not pass through solid objects, but objects that are smaller than the bird may pass through it. Ranulf often uses Petite Phoenix''
''in conjunction with Transmutation of Fire to move objects such as doors and inconvenient sections of walls. Fires targeted by this spell can be up to ten times the size of a hearth fire. (Base 10, + 2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 size)''

===Ward Against Immolation===

''ReIg 35 R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind The caster is rendered immune to heat and fire less than that of the most powerful of Ignem magics. The caster and his possessions receive a +35 bonus to Soak against damage from heat. While this spell is active, Ranulf can (due to the resistance to heat provided by his Ignem Form resistance bonus) tolerate, barely, the heat generated by his Self Immolation spell. However, Ward Against Immolation, like Self Immolation, is a spell of Duration Diameter. As a result, Ranulf must cast this protective spell prior to casting Self Immolation; if Ranulf fails to cast Ward Against Immolation again before the original casting expires, the Self Immolation spell would cause him severe harm (as a Personal Range spell, it does not need to penetrate his Magic Resistance). (Base 4, +1 Diameter, +6 intensity of heat)''

===Unified Flame===

''ReIg Level 35 R: Arc, D: Sun, T: Group This spell alters the target fires to resemble one another in all ways. The fires to be targeted by this spell must all be Arcane Connections to one another. The targeted fires''
''change over the course of a few minutes to mirror one another completely in the shape of their flames, the sound of their roar and crackling, and the smoke that they produce. Any changes in one fire will be reflected in the others. The affected fires all take on a slightly unnatural appearance as their flames move into a configuration that does not completely match the logs that they are burning, and they are altered by the sigil of the casting wizard. When Ranulf’s apprentice is away from him, the apprentice is instructed to kindle a fire using a coal stored in the Chest of the Ember Seed just after sunset every evening. While this spell is normally intended to unite two fires, the spell was designed with a Target of Group. Ranulf believed that the effort required to create a spell that affected just two fires would be as great as or greater than the work needed to develop a spell that targeted a group, because of the difficulty of using non-standard Targets. As a result, more than two fires can be affected by this spell, and the caster could be completely unaware of the additional fires (possibly allowing a communication to be intercepted, see Discourse of Glowing Tongues above). This spell is an example of magic created to match the needs of the magus. For most magi, any number of Intellego spells would provide a significantly easier method of communication. Yet for Ranulf, who has a Magical Focus in unnatural fires and the Deficient Technique Flaw with Intellego, the season that he invested to invent this spell was a wiser choice than trying to learn magics not suited to his talents. (Base 3, +4 Arcane Connection, +2 Sun, +2 Group)''
''Magi of Hermes Terram Spells''

===Transmutation of Fire===

''MuTe(He,Ig) Level 40 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Part This spell transmutes an object of stone, wood, or soil, or part of some such object, into a fire. The fire is still essentially the original object and will not be extinguished for lack of fuel, but it can be doused or extinguished in other ways. The transmuted fire is no larger than 2 paces in size and it is hot enough to do +5 damage. Objects smaller than 2 paces in size will turn into fires of their own size when they are subjected to this spell. (Base 5, + 2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 part, +1 to affect stone, +1 Herbam requisite)''
''Vim Spells''

===Group Wizard’s Boost (Form)===

''MuVi Level Gen R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group The magus casts this spell as another spell of a level 10 or more levels less than the Group Wizard’s Boost is being multi-cast. The effect of each of the targeted spells increases five levels in power. The effects of the extra five levels of power are for the Storyguide to determine. A Wizard’s Boost spell may not affect a spell more than once. (Base General, +1 Touch, + 2 Group)''

===Wizard’s Expansion (Form)===

''MuVi General R: Voice, D: Momentary, T: Individual The Target of the targeted spell increases by one category; all targets affected by the expanded spell must be legal targets for the original spell. There are ten versions of Wizard’s Expansion, one for each form. The targeted spell must be at least one magnitude lower than this spell. A single spell may not be affected more than once with this spell, but when two magi cooperate, a spell can be the target of both Wizard’s Expansion and Wizard’s Reach, providing that one of the two Muto Vim spells''
''is at least two magnitudes higher than the target spell. (Base effect, +2 Voice)''

===The Patient Spell===

''ReVi Level Gen R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind When this spell is cast in conjunction with a second spell (requiring an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9), the other spell is delayed in taking effect until the caster ceases concentration on The Patient Spell. The target spell can be of no higher level than the level of The Patient Spell. A spell held using The Patient Spell may be released to interrupt an action in the same manner as a fast cast spell, requiring the same “fast casting” roll of Quickness + Finesse (ArM5 page 83). Ranulf uses The Patient Spell to provide himself with an opportunity to cast Boreal Flames with Pilum of Fire. Maintaining concentration on The Patient Spell while casting another spell requires an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to perform successfully; this is easier than normal, because the spell is designed for this use. (Base effect, +1 Touch, + 1 Concentration)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Ranulf has created the following items.''
''Ribbon of Arcane Preservation''
''This is an eighteen-inch-long silk ribbon with the following single effect enchanted into it as a lesser enchantment using three pawns of vis. This item was created from a set of laboratory notes passed between hoplites.''

===Preserved Connection===

''CrVi 29 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Const, T: Ind When the Ribbon of Arcane Preservation is tied around an object, the magics in the ribbon work to delay the degradation of any Arcane Connections that the object has. Arcane Connections affected by the Effect will decay as if they had a duration two levels higher on the Arcane Connection chart (ArM5 page 84). Arcane Connections that''

|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''New Guidelines: CrVi''
''Creo Vim spells and powers can be used to prolong the durations of Arcane Connections in a manner analogous to the way that Perdo Vim effects can decrease their duration. Arcane Connections under the effects of a Creo Vim spell still decay, but at a slower rate than they do naturally. An Arcane Connection that is being preserved by a Creo Vim spell does not have its penetration multiplier increased. Unlike Perdo Vim magics that permanently degrade connections instantly, Creo Vim spells only retard the decay of connections during their duration. Spell guidelines are similar to the guidelines for Perdo Vim Arcane Connection spells.''
''Level 5: Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were one step higher on the table in ArM5, page 84. If this increases''
''the Duration to Years or greater, the duration of the connection continues to be measured in a period of years. Hermetic magic can not make an Arcane Connection last indefinitely without fixing the connection as described in ArM5, page 94. Note that the range is the range to the Arcane Connection, and you must know what you are targeting just like any other spell. Level 10: Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were two steps higher on the table in ArM5, page 84, subject to the same limits as above. Level 15: Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were three steps higher on the table in ArM5, page 84, subject to the same limits as above.''

''normally decay in hours will instead decay in weeks while the ribbon is tied around them; Arcane Connections that normally decay in days instead decay in months. The penetration multiplier for an Arcane Connection is not altered by this affect. (Effect: Base 10, + 1 Touch, +2 Sun; Modifications +1 level 2 uses per day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''
''Chest of the Ember Seed''
''This is a small stone box the size of an apple, that’s lined with fired clay and held closed by leather straps. Ranulf has enchanted the box as a lesser enchanted device with the following power, using four pawns of vis:''

===Bed of the Resting Coal===

''Cr Ig 34 Pen +0, constant R: Touch, D: sun T:group Objects that are placed within this box are heated enough to glow red-hot. Ranulf’s apprentice uses this box to keep coals from a fire hot. These small portions of the original are Arcane Connections to the original fire with a Duration of Months (like a hair from a person or a feather from a bird). When a burning coal is grown into a larger fire this second fire remains an Arcane Connection to the first. While the Chest of the Ember Seed is in use, it becomes very hot over the course of hours and days. Ranulf’s apprentice regularly wraps up the apple-sized chest in an insulated box and uses cold water to cool the chest’s surface, and occasionally has had to resort to more drastic measures (such as Perdo Ignem spontaneous magic). (Effect: Base 5, +2 Sun, +1 Touch, +2 Group; Modifications: +3 levels environmental trigger, +1 level 2 uses per day)''
''Laboratory of Ranulf''
''Ranulf opened the wooden room that serves as his laboratory as an invested device. The room is opened as a compound device with only the highest vis capacity component (the limestone fireplace) instilled with vis. The room was opened with twelve pawns of vis. Seven of these twelve pawns are filled with enchantments. The room has three effects invested in it.''
''With reference to the laboratory personalization rules in Covenants, pages 113 and 115, this item provides the Excessive Heating, Excessive Lighting, and Lesser Feature (Ignem specialization) Virtues to Ranulf’s laboratory without any modifications to the laboratory’s Upkeep or Safety values. While this item was being integrated into his laboratory, Ranulf’s laboratory acquired the Highly Organized Virtue, as well.''

===Eyes of the Acolyte===

''InIg 8 Pen +0, constant effect R: Personal, D: Constant, T: Ind This effect detects any fires in the laboratory larger than a lantern flame that are not in the fireplace or the product of the Facade of Pentecost power. (Effect: Base 2, +2 Sun; Modifications +1 level 2 uses per day +3 levels environmental trigger)''

===Laboratory That Has Learned From Experience===

''PeIg 23 Pen +0, 24/day R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind This effect is triggered by the Eyes of the Acolyte power. The Laboratory of Ranulf automatically extinguishes any fires that are detected by Eyes of the Acolyte. This effect is only capable of extinguishing fires that do +20 damage or less per round. This power can act to dispel Creo Ignem spells with Durations longer than Momentary, such as Coat of Flame, but it is not sufficiently quick to counter a spell as it is being cast. On those occasions where Ranulf desires to have fires in his laboratory that are larger than a lantern flame, not in the fireplace, or not the product of the Facade of Pentecost power, he exhausts the 24 daily uses of this effect. (Effect: Base 4, +3 more intense fires; Modifications +5 levels 24 uses per day +3 levels linked trigger)''

===Facade of Pentecost===

''Cr(Re)Ig 41 Pen +0, 50/day, item maintains concentration R: Per D: Conc, T: Group This effect calls into being up to ten flames that may appear at any specified point''
''within the laboratory, even floating unsupported in mid-air. These flames burn without fuel until they are dismissed by the user or until sunrise/sunset. The flames move under the control of the user and can be used to flawlessly burn intricate patterns into objects, or to illuminate the laboratory in a myriad of ways. In theory, these flames could be used to defend the laboratory, with each flame doing +10 damage per round to a target. Ranulf has never had the need to defend his laboratory in this manner (although during the design of the item he did consider adding a linked trigger to an Intellego Animal effect so that any vermin intruding into the room would be automatically dispatched). (Effect: Base 10, +1 Rego requisite, +1 concentration, +2 group; Modifications +5 levels item maintains concentration, +6 levels 50/day)''
''Talisman: Staff of Ranulf''
''Ranulf enchanted a staff for his talisman. The staff is made of coiled lengths of ash, hazel, and oak, and  it is bound with iron, inset with leaden and silver traceries, and has a tiny ruby mounted in a silver ring just above where it is held. It was originally opened with 15 pawns of vis to fill the ruby. At age 54, Ranulf has the first four effects given below instilled into the item, filling all fifteen pawns of the item’s opened capacity.''
''Attunements +6 to fire related effects +4 to control things at a distance +2 repel things +3 to divination''
''By the age of 84, Ranulf has opened his talisman further, using 10 more pawns of vis and enchanting Shriek of the Impending Shafts and Defense of the Roaring Furnace into his talisman, with two more corresponding attunements. This leaves four unfilled pawns capacity in the talisman.''
''Additional Attunements +4 destroy things at a distance +4 affect dead wood.''

===Topiary of Flames===

''ReIg 44 Pen +0, 12/day item maintains concentration R: Voice D: Conc, T: Ind (+2 size) This effect re-shapes a single fire into a shape desired by the wielder. The fire may stretch and extend in any direction but it can not be pulled completely away from its source of fuel, nor can the volume of the fire be increased by this effect. Ranulf typically uses this effect to change large fires into walls, bridges, and staircases, often making these features very thin and delicate to stretch the fire as far as possible. No part of the fire’s new shape can be further than the range of the caster’s voice. A Finesse roll should be used if exceptional precision or targeting is required. This effect can target fires of tremendous size (up to 100 times the size of a standard Ignem individual fire). (Effect: Base10, +2 Voice, +1 concentration, +2 size; Modifications +5 levels item maintains concentration, +4 levels 12x/day)''

===Flames of Stone===

''MuIg(Te) 38 Pen +0, 3/day item maintains concentration R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind (+1 size) This effect changes the flames of the target fire to be as hard and stable as stone. The flames still have no weight and the target fire still produces both heat and smoke. Ranulf often uses this effect in combination with the Topiary of Flames effect to create temporary structures. The target fire can be no larger''
''than a small house or large hut (ten times the size of a standard Ignem individual). (Effect: Base 10 +2 voice, +1 concentration, +1 size; Modifications +5 levels item maintains concentration, +3 levels 6 uses per day)''

===Shadow of Spring Times Departed===

''Cr(Mu)He 5 Pen +0, 1x/day R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind When Shadow of Spring Times Departed is active, the wooden sections of Ranulf’s talisman slowly repair themselves of damage by growing back to their original state. The talisman heals at the speed of well-watered grass growing, and only heals when exposed to sunlight and occasional water. Scratches in the wooden parts of the talisman disappear over the course of few days, while more-substantial damage to the staff could take months to heal. This instilled power naturally cannot be activated if the staff is completely broken. The Creo nature of this power makes the staff grow back to its ideal state rather than shooting forth roots, leaves, and limbs, while the Muto requisite allows dead wood to grow as if it were alive. (Effect: Base 3, + 2 Sun)''

===Surfeit of Fuel===

''CrHe 27 Pen +0, 3/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group (+2 size) This effect conjures a pile of dry wood containing the mass of several large trees. While Ranulf does occasionally use this ef''
''fect to provide an abundance of firewood, he more frequently finds the creation of a large pile of wood to be valuable for other reasons. (Effect: Base 4 +1 Touch +2 Sun, +2 size; Modifications +2 levels 3 uses per day)''

===Shriek of the Impending Shafts===

''InHe 16 Pen +0, 2x/day, item maintains concentration R: Per, D: Conc T: Hearing With the above exceptions, this effect functions as the spell Shriek of the Impending Shafts (ArM5, page 136). (Effect: Base 2, +1 Concentration, +3 Hearing; Modifications +5 levels item maintains concentration, +1 level 2 uses per day)''

===Defense of the Roaring Furnace===

''CrIg 58 Pen +0, unlimited uses R: Special D: Mom T: Ind Defense of the Roaring Furnace burns any fast-moving wooden item that comes within a pace of the holder of Ranulf’s talisman with a blast of fire sufficiently intense to reduce arrows to ash and weaken pole arms to the point of snapping. Only wooden objects that are moving sufficiently fast to cause a person harm are targeted by this effect. The fires produced by this effect do +35 damage. The talisman will never target itself with this effect. (Effect: Base 30, + 3 Voice equivalent non-standard; Modifications +10 levels unlimited uses, +3 levels linked trigger)''
