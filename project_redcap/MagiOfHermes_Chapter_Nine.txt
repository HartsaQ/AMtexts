''Concept: This giant-blooded magus seeks to create living beings by combining the features of two or more existing creatures, with the minotaur as his final goal.''
''Marcus Tauros of Criamon’s immense size has always been a source of great embarrassment to him, and he hates to draw attention to himself. He was mercilessly (and often brutally) teased as a child, and was supremely grateful to his master, both for taking him away from those who feared his Gift, and for and teaching him a way to make himself better. He still gets very angry when others draw attention to his height, even in a non-derogatory manner. His master was an anatomist and taught him much about the workings of the body, and cultivated his natural aptitude with the various organs. When Marcus casts a spell, his Warped magic causes his internal organs to glow so brightly they can be seen through his skin. Which organ is affected is determined by the Form of the spell used: Animal & Auram — liver; Aquam & Imaginem — brain; Corpus & Vim — heart; Herbam & Terram — spleen; Ignem & Mentem — gallbladder. During his initiation into the mysteries of House Criamon, he received a vision of his past life as a Minoan priest on the island of Crete, and saw himself create the monstrous minotaur from a man and a sacred bull. He has devoted his learning to recreating that act, believing that if he can successfully call across the Wheel of Time to his former life, he can improve his perceived deficiencies in body and mind, and make a better self. When he completes this research, it is likely that he will overcome his Low Self-Esteem Flaw and gain a Confidence Score of 1. His single-mindedness in pursuing his obsession has meant that he has neglected many of the typical significators of Hermetic maturity, such as a familiar or apprentice, and he only began his talisman after forty years as a magus.''

''Original Research''
''Many neckless faces sprouted, arms were wandering bereft of shoulders and eyes roamed alone in search of foreheads. – Empedocles, fragment 57''
''Marcus’ obsession is with the CounterCyclical Alam (see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 47), a world which is the mirror of ours across the Wheel of Time, but progressing toward perfect harmony while our world descends into strife. As the counter-cyclical world progresses from chaos to order, simple life first appeared in the form of organs made from the primordial swirl of chaos. As the force of harmony increased in that universe, these organs combined together to form living creatures, and then these creatures combined to form the chimeric forms of legend: bull-headed men, women with lions’ bodies, the chimera itself — an amalgam of lion, goat, and snake. Eventually, all life will be combined together in ultimate harmony. Marcus believes that the fantastic creatures of antiquity were creatures of greater harmony than those today, and seeks to recreate them in this world. However, Hermetic magic does not allow the creation of new creatures by combining the bodies of others, so Marcus is seeking a means to do so through a Breakthrough in magical theory (Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, pages 26–30). Marcus has accumulated 41 breakthrough points through Original Research and Insight towards this Major Breakthrough, which would manifest as a Hermetic Virtue called Hermetic Metamorphosis (see insert for the likely result of this Original Research). The spells here represent his attempts to pursue this path. He also invented The Wizard’s Mount, Prying Eyes, and The Beast Remade (from Ars Magica Fifth Edition), which yielded him 5 breakthrough points, from the latter.''

''CrAn 20 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Creates a beetle. All invertebrates are''

===Flight Perfected===

''CrAn 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Creates a dove in the hands of the caster. The bird acts like a normal bird for the duration of the spell. This spell provided Marcus with no breakthrough. (base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Flight Divorced===

''CrAn 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part Creates a pair of bird wings, joined at their base. The wings flap frantically in ran''
''dom flight for the duration of the spell, since they lack sense organs or a mind to guide them. If released in an enclosed space, the erratic flight of the wings provides sufficient distraction to impose a –3 penalty on all rolls requiring mental effort or concentration, and adds an extra botch die to all activities. The guideline used in this spell creates a living bird rather than an animal’s corpse, and the Part Target produces just the wings. This spell provided Marcus with a breakthrough in the first of the two seasons it took him to invent it. (base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

===Strength Extinguished===

''CrAn 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part Creates a bull’s heart. This spell provided Marcus with no breakthrough. (base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

===Strength Renewed===

''CrAn 35 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part Creates a bull’s heart that continues to beat strongly for the duration of the spell. In the three seasons it took Marcus to learn this spell, he was lucky enough to get a breakthrough. However, the spell also has a minor flaw thanks to experimentation; the heart only beats in the light, and the strength of the pulse is dependant on the amount of light — in shadow the beat is thready and shallow, while in bright sunshine it is like a drum. (base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

''New Virtue: Hermetic Metamorphosis''
''Minor, Supernatural & Hermetic You are able to graft organs onto an animal’s body to make a new creature. The donor organs can be from another animal or created magically using a Creo Animal ritual spell of Momentary Duration. The recipient must be an animal — a further breakthrough is needed to extend this Virtue to allow a human to be the recipient of an animal organ. The process of metamorphosis requires the casting of a special ritual spell that can only be invented by those who possess this Virtue. It’s not known if such creatures breed true, but most likely not. Note that this Virtue does not yet exist, but once Marcus has completed his work it will be integrated into Hermetic theory through Original Research, and may be taught to other magi either through personal instruction or by writing a tractatus describing the breakthrough. The source must grant at least 5 experience points in a single season for the Virtue to be conferred.''

===Harmonic Metamorphosis of the Beast===

''Cr(Mu)An 35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual This spell can only be successfully''
''cast by those with the Hermetic Metamorphosis Virtue. It requires the immobilized body of the recipient animal, and the donor organ. If the donor derives from another animal, it too must be immobilized. During the casting of the spell, the caster removes the organ from the donor and grafts it to the recipient. The spell resizes the organ (if necessary) and joins up the blood supply and internal organs. The type of organs that can be transplanted are functional units of the animal — its head, pair of hind legs, tail, pair of hands, heart, and so forth. A replacement organ involves the removal of the recipient’s organ and putting the donor organ in its place. If the caster wishes he may take the recipient’s original organ and put it in the space left on the donor, but this requires two surgical rolls (see below), one for each animal. A transposed organ involves the recipient gaining an organ without removing something first; for example, giving it a pair of wings or a second head. The donor animal (if any) dies as a result of this type of surgery. Magical surgery of this type can be purely anatomical, or else confer a Virtue from the donor to the recipient. An anatomical change can grant the recipient a new ability (such as flight) or a Quality (see''
''Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 40–43). A Virtue can be any General Virtue that derives from the body of the animal; such as Keen Vision, Long-Winded, or Tough. A donor who loses a Virtue due to this spell receives the Enfeebled Flaw if it survives the surgery. The ritual surgery performed as part of the magical actions of casting this spell needs to be performed accurately to ensure the success of the spell. This requires a Dexterity + Chirurgy roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If the organ is transposed rather than replaced, the Ease Factor has a +3 modifier. If the surgery grants a Virtue rather than an anatomical change, the Ease Factor has an additional +3 modifier. If the surgery roll fails then the animal dies soon after the casting of the spell. If the surgery roll botches, then the spell creates some dreadful monster instead. Example: Marcus wishes to swap the head of a lion and an eagle in his first step to creating a griffin. Eagles have the Keen Vision Virtue, so this is more than simple anatomical surgery. To successfully implant the eagle’s head on the lion’s body, his surgery roll has an Ease Factor of 12. He needs only a 9 to successfully implant the lion’s head on the eagle’s body, but the lion-headed eagle that results suffers from the Enfeebled Flaw. The spell compensates for the vast difference in size between the two heads. (base 25, +1 Touch, +1 Muto requisite)''
''cation, if any. In general the animal grows larger (although does not usually gain a point of Size), its hair grows longer and any horns, teeth and claws available as weapons become more vicious. The animal often loses its domestic coloration, becoming plain brown or brindled grey. Note that in Mythic Europe dogs are not domesticated wolves, and cows were not bred from the primeval aurochs — animals were created in the state in which they are found. Yet all are familiar with the process of a beast becoming feral if abandoned by man, and that is what this spell does. Marcus did not gain any breakthrough from this spell. (base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)''

===The Griffin Reborn===

''MuAn 35 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Pair, Ritual During the casting of this ritual spell, the caster removes the heads of two animals and reattaches them on each other’s bodies. The surgery causes no damage as long as the spell is cast correctly. With a Corpus casting requisite one of the targets can be a human, but at least one must be an animal. At the end of the duration, the caster can restore the heads to their owners if both are present, but if either target is absent then both die. Like Spirit of the Bull of Minos, this spell is the result of an insight into the ancient magics of the Minoan priests. The atypical Target of Pair is part of the non-Hermetic specification of this spell, and is treated as Target Group for the purposes of spell calculation. A Hermetic variant would use Target Part, but only affect a single creature. (base 5, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Pair)''

===Icarus’ Folly===

''MuAn 40 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The targeted animal is given a pair of wings. It does not immediately know how to fly, but just like a fledging bird it succeeds after the first few attempts. Unfortunately, a flaw introduced in the experimental process makes the duration of this spell unreliable; at the end of every hour of the duration, roll a simple die. If the result is equal or lower than the number of hours that have passed, the spell’s duration ends prematurely. After the precipitous death of the first few test subjects, Marcus named the spell after the legendary inventor of wings who himself plummeted to death after flying''
''too close to the sun. As if in compensation for the flawed spell, the second season of invention resulted in a breakthrough. (base 25, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''
''Corpus Spells''

===a Limb Bereft===

''Cr(Re)Co 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part Creates a human leg that is animated and able to move by hopping. Through a quirk in the experimentation process, the leg has an inclination to kick anything it comes near; while there is little danger of serious damage, it is a grisly distraction. If its chosen target decides not to attack the limb directly, he takes a –3 penalty to all rolls and 2 extra botch dice. Marcus was intrigued to discover that human limbs cannot be created as animate (unlike animal organs) and required a Rego requisite to provide motion. This spell did not provide him with any breakthrough, however. (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part, +1 Rego requisite)''

===Eyes From the Wizard Torn===

''Mu(In, Re)Co(Im) 15 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Part This macabre variation on Image from the Wizard Torn and Prying Eyes actually removes the caster’s eyes and has them fly to the location of interest where they transmit the information that they see. At the end of the spell, the caster’s eyes are restored to their proper place. This spell did not result in a breakthrough, although Marcus has found it useful. The Rego requisite is required to allow the eyes to fly, but does not incur additional magnitudes. (base 3, +1 Conc, +1 Part, +1 Intellego requisite, +1 Imaginem requisite)''

===Spirit of the Bull of Minos===

''MuCo(An) 20 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual During the casting of this ritual spell, the target’s heart is cut out and replaced with the heart of a bull. The surgery causes no damage as long as the spell is cast correctly, and it grants the target the Reserves of Strength Virtue throughout the duration of the spell. At the end of the year, the caster can replace the original heart of the target with no ill effects if it has been preserved sufficiently well. If this is not done, the target dies. This spell results from an Insight (see Ancient Magic, pages 8–9) Marcus received after investigating the catacombs under the ruined palace of Knossos. There he found ritual objects belonging to the Minoan Cult of the Bull who practiced a magic similar to that he was trying to achieve. His ability to read the memories of a sacrificial knife (thanks to the third station of the Path of Seeming, see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 64–65) gave him the requisite insight to allow him to invent this non-standard spell. He has created an enchanted item called a Canopic Jar to preserve the heart of his experimental subjects (see Enchantments, below). (base 2, +1 Touch, +4 Year; level 20 due to ritual effect)''

===Kiss of the Enigma===

''CrVi 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The target acquires two Warping Points, and, if a Hermetic magus, must check to see whether he enters Twilight in the normal way. Marcus invented this spell primarily to use on caged animals, to see if he could induce monstrous characteristics by infusing their bodies with pure magical energies, but the results were disappointingly random. He had to invent this spell three times before it yielded a breakthrough. The two prior versions both had Side Effects due to experimentation: the first spell changed the color of the target’s hair, while the other made the target’s skin transparent. (base 10, +1 Touch)''

''Corpus Spells''

===Bushy Tail of the Branch-dancer===

''MuCo(An) 5 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The target gains the long tail of a squirrel, giving him a +3 to all rolls to keep his balance. (base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, requisite free)''

===Slime of the Muck-dweller===

''MuCo(An) 5 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The target gains the slippery, slimy skin of an eel, which gives him a +6 bonus to his Defense Total against grappling attacks (base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, requisite free)''

===Sure-footedness of the Crag-leaper===

''MuCo(An) 5 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The target gains the hooves of a mountain goat, giving him a +3 to all rolls to climb and descend steep cliffs and precipitous crags. (base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, requisite free)''

===Webbed Toes of the Pond-dweller===

''MuCo(An) 5 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The target gains the feet of a frog, giving him a +3 to rolls to swim in still or slowly moving water. (base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, requisite free)''

===Gift of the Minotaur===

''MuCo(An) 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part The target of this spell gains the head of''
''a bull. The target’s capacity to speak is not affected by the spell, but his voice is. The target may use his horns as a weapon, using the Brawl Ability and the following weapon statistics: Init +2, Attack +3, Defense +2, Damage +3 (base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

===Stillness of the Dead===

''ReCo(An) 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The target is rendered completely immobile for the duration of the spell. This spell will work on both humans and animals, and Marcus developed it for use on targets affected by his various bizarre ritual spells that remove or exchange body parts. (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Animal requisite)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Marcus has designed the following enchanted items.''
''The Labyrinth of the Open Mind''
''Marcus has enchanted the floor to his laboratory to assist in his magical investigations. It is made from two types of wood, one pale and the other stained dark. The complex pattern produced at Marcus’ exacting instructions forms a labyrinth, and Marcus’ sanctum has been arranged so that items of furniture and pieces of laboratory equipment are located in mystically significant locations. Each “path” of the interlaced design is enchanted with a different effect, all of which are designed to provide magical enhancements to his laboratory activities (see Covenants, page 121 for details of Magic Items for Laboratories). The floor was prepared with 10 pawns of Vim vis (a huge item made of wood). It has been enchanted with three effects that occupy 9 pawns’ worth of space.''

===Path To Serendipitous Discovery===

''CrVi 24 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Room Pen 0, constant effect Everything in Marcus’ sanctum is tainted slightly with magic. This gives him a +2 laboratory specialization in Experimentation, but unfortunately has the unintended side effect of increasing its Warping Score by 1. (base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Room; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger)''

===Path To Enlightened Operations===

''ReAn 20 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room Pen 0, unlimited uses per day Items made of animal products — like most of Marcus’ custom-built laboratory equipment — are supported in the air wherever they are released, and maintained there until plucked free. If left floating, Marcus’ tools slowly move, aligning themselves into propitious arrangements that actually enhance the activity in question. This enchantment gives Marcus’s laboratory a +1 General Quality. (base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Room; +10 unlimited/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''

===Path of Shadows Beneath the Skin===

''InCo(An) 40 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Vision Pen 0, 1/day This effect grants the target the ability to see the internal organs of humans or animals as a magical sense. This greatly enhances laboratory operations employing Corpus or Animal (or, indeed, both), granting a +2 laboratory specialization in both Arts. (base 5, +1 Conc, +4 Vision, +1 Animal requisite; +5 item maintains concentration)''
''Canopic Jar''
''This jar takes the form of a rotund human figure about 18 inches tall made of alabaster. The lid of the jar is carved into the shape of the figure’s head; of Marcus’ four copies, one has the head of a hawk, one a lion, one''
''a baboon, and one a human. The Canopic Jars are figured and named after the jars used in ancient Egypt to preserve the organs of mummified kings. These were made as Lesser Enchantments, and Marcus was able to make two in a single season.''

===Halt Corruption’s Work===

''CrCo 9 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Pen 0, constant effect Any bodily organ placed inside is protected from putrefaction while it remains within the jar. (base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger)''
''The Mark of Protection''
''Marcus has a tattoo depicting the sun in its glory that covers his entire abdomen. He has enchanted this tattoo as an invested item, preparing it for enchantment with 6 pawns of vis (tattoos have a base material cost of 2 — see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 51 — and its size gives it a multiplier of 3). The purple ink that was used to inscribe the tattoo was extracted from the murex shell, and the crushed shells were also included, granting a Shape and Material bonus of +2 to protective effects. The tattoo holds two effects, occupying all 6 pawns’ worth of space.''

===Resilience of Theseus===

''MuCo 39 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Pen 0, constant effect Marcus has a +4 to all Soak rolls. However, due to the experimentation used to create the effect it has a minor flaw — the tattoo must be exposed to grant the bonus, rather than being covered by clothing. (base 20, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger)''

===Ariadne’s Thread===

''InCo 20 R: Arc, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen 0, 1/day''
''The target always knows exactly where he is in relation to one or more Arcane Connections he has in distant locations. The more Arcane Connections to himself he has, the more accurate his estimation of position; he can feel the tug of each one as he turns in a full circle, and the relative strength tells him the distance. Consequently, the caster is never lost. Marcus invented this effect after one of his ordeals on the Path of Seeming left him hundreds of miles from home in a land where no-one spoke his language. (base 3, +4 Arc, +1 complexity)''
''Talisman: Bucephalos''
''Marcus began to develop his talisman comparatively late in his career, since he has been obsessively pursuing his original research. It shares its name (meaning “oxfaced”) with Alexander the Great’s favorite horse. It is a wooden staff four feet long, which for the giant-sized Marcus is proportioned like a walking stick rather than a weapon. The shaft is made of linden wood and is wide — three inches in diameter. The staff’s head is a glossy chunk of magnetite carved into the shape of a bull’s head. The eyes of the bull are topaz. It was prepared for enchantment with 12 pawns of Vim vis (the highest single-cost part of the item is the tiny semi-precious stones), and has been attuned as a talisman. It currently has 3 effects occupying 9 pawns’ worth of space.''
''Attunements +3 Animal (magnetite) +2 protection against weapons (linden) +4 control things at a distance (staff)''

===Mastering the Unruly Beast===

''ReAn 33 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen 16, 1/day As the spell of the same name. The effect is triggered by pointing the bull-head at the creature and slowly lowering it. (base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Sun; +8 Penetration)''

===Punishment of Midas===

''MuCo(An) 40 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group Pen 0, 1/day One limb of each target turns into that of a random animal. Roll two simple dice: one for the limb, and one for the animal.''
''Limb: 1 to 2 – Head; 3 to 6 – Arm (odd: left, even: right); 7 to 10 – Leg (odd: left, even: right)''
''Animal: 1 – goat; 2 – pig; 3 – hare; 4 – chicken; 4 – donkey; 5 – dog; 6 – lizard; 7 – toad; 8 – cow; 9 – rat; 10 – beetle.''
''All limbs are re-scaled in size to match that of the replaced limb. Anything held in a transformed hand is dropped, and a transformed leg becomes inappropriate to the current footwear and may trip up the wearer. If the head is transformed, the target cannot speak but retains his intelligence. Up to 10 people can be simultaneously affected; if there are fewer than 10 individuals, then some targets may experience a change in more than one limb. The effect is triggered by pointing the bull-head at a group and making a circling gesture while speaking the command word. Marcus had only intended to cause changes in land animals, but his experimentation caused the anomalous result of a chicken. (base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group)''

===Return To the Earth===

''MuTe 20 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen 10, 24/day A metal or stone object targeted by this effect is momentarily transformed into sand. This is sufficient to destroy most handheld weapons, as they become metal grains around the feet of the wielder. But if the object remains undisturbed, it is unaffected when it becomes metal again moments later. The effect can target any single object that can be carried in one hand, such as a sword. The effect is triggered by pointing the butt of the staff at the target in a short jabbing motion while speaking the command word. (base 2, +2 Voice, +2 affect metal; +5 Penetration, +5 24/day)''
