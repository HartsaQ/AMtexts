''The Covenant of the Northern Seas is a spring covenant formed from a flotilla of ships that navigate Mythic Europe’s northern seas, charting courses from the Rhine to Hibernia, and Iceland to Iberia. The covenant’s magi are led by a magus of House Tytalus, who brings years of experience at sea and a desire to see his new covenant achieve its full potential. Behind this though, the Tytalus is really after something audacious; the founding of a new Tribunal in the one place nobody has yet thought to look.''

==History==

''As a Spring covenant, The Northern Seas has little history to speak of beyond the events that led to the covenant’s formation. The rest, of course, is yet to be written. As an apprentice, Carles followed his master from Tribunal to Tribunal and covenant to covenant. His master, Felix, was a specialist in restorative magics and longevity rituals and young Carles witnessed firsthand the fear of elderly magi whose only aim was to prolong their empty lives year after year. He vowed that his life would never descend to that. Upon his gauntlet, he acquired his first ship, La Charytee, having diced with an old sea-captain. Rather than leaving the old man behind, he hired him to captain the ship and to take her to the world’s edge! In the end, those initial years at sea involved nothing so grand and Carles simply sailed the seas, learning what he needed, growing as a magus and a man. When he felt ready for the world’s edge he sailed as far to the west as he could, arriving in faerie land, where he sailed further still. It was there, in a land where every island was an empire, and every man ruled his own kingdom, that he realized what he wanted; his own Tribunal. His''
''experiences had given him inspiration, but his journeys had shown him where to build it; on the ocean itself. He encountered the Bjornaer Hilde Oddfish as Hilde was seeking out her ancestor in order to explore her inner heartbeast and the two struck up a firm and lasting friendship. With Hilde confined to the sea for half her life, Carles’ notion of a Tribunal of the oceans struck a chord. The magi acquired a second vessel, the Marie de Bayonne, for Hilde and they started exploring together, finding that the ocean was magically far richer than any had previously assumed. The last decade has been spent in acquiring enough funds to purchase four other ships to complete their covenant. Leaving this fleet in Hilde’ care, Carles traveled widely looking for disaffected young apprentices and magi that he could tempt. He attended as many Tribunals as he could in recent years and he was successful four times over and one by one the covenant grew. Depending on when you start, the magi have either just started sailing together or''
''are about to start their maiden voyage as a covenant. Until this point, the covenant’s time has been taken up with outfitting each ship with the essential laboratory. And now, the open ocean awaits.''

==Boons & Hooks==

''The covenant is described through the following Boons and Hooks, details of which can be found in the Covenants supplement: Mystical Allies (Major Surroundings Boon): Merfolk are more than just stories that old sailors tell for the price of an ale. They have their kingdoms beneath the sea, they have their princes and their rogues, and so long as the covenant of the Northern Seas treats them well, they make potent allies. Criminals (Minor Residents Boon): Whether on land or on sea, the covenant can call upon men willing to risk punishment under law on the covenant’s behalf. Difficult Access (Minor Site Boon): Knowing where the covenant is going to be makes for a good start, but those intent on visiting must have means to travel to the ships on the open seas. Famous Resident (Minor Resident Boon): Carles Magnus has built a reputation for himself and his bold idea of a sea-borne covenant. As a result, most covenants surrounding the northern seas have heard of him. His name carries influence either as an inspiration to magi with pretensions to forge their own path, or as a figure of scandal. Healthy Feature (Minor Site Boon): The open seas and the clean air, free from corruption, are excellent for the humors. At the expense of weathering storms and wintering in safe harbors, the magi and covenfolk are generally fitter and healthier than their landlocked counterparts.''

|]
''Informants (Minor External Boon): The misfits of the Northern Seas may be the black sheep of their former covenants, but they still have their contacts. Some of the younger magi grew up alongside others still learning their Arts who are eager for stories of the high seas. This means the covenant receives word of the interests of important magi and covenants, which may help the covenant in trade. Local Ally (Minor External Boon): A prominent tax collector at Barfleur, nominally the covenant’s home port, is a strong ally to the covenant. He is a member of the town’s Jewish community and owes much to the covenant’s elder magi for help and protection they afforded him and his family some years ago. Further information is provided below. Ungoverned (Minor External Boon): No ruler can truly lay claim to the seas, although the trade alliances and mercantile families probably try. As a result, the magi of the Northern Seas govern themselves and, ports and harbors aside, can afford to be a law unto themselves. Sailors (Residents Free Choice): The covenfolk are virtually all sailors.''
''Missing Aura (Major Site Hook): A covenant at sea cannot expect to sail within a magical aura all year. There are auras out there, but they are small and widely distributed. As a result, the covenant has a base magical aura of zero. Tribunal Border (Major External Hook): While nominally in the Normandy Tribunal, the independent covenant of the Northern Seas sails the borderlands between multiple Tribunals. The covenant’s connection to Normandy is tenuous at best and its magi enjoy a freedom not often granted to others. As the covenant proves the sea’s worth, multiple Tribunals may try to tempt them into membership. However, when those approaches are rebuffed, proud Tribunals may decide to take action against the upstart covenant. Erratically Mobile (Minor Site Hook): Not only do the ships of the Northern Seas sail where they will, but they may not always sail together. This means that finding the covenant and/or specific members can be difficult. The covenant does have allies on dry land, but their visits may not be regular. Gender Imbalance (Minor Residents Hook): Many sailors agree that a ship is''
''no place for a woman. As a result, and despite the covenant playing home to a female captain, the ships’ crews are overwhelmingly male. Others may view the covenant as somewhat aggressive and there is little chance for family life within the covenant. Possession Victim (Minor Residents Hook): As the covenant lacks an Aegis, the ships rely on relics or on Hermetic spells to protect the ship and crew from the infernal. Despite this, there is an infernal presence on board one of the ships and the demon is playing the long game of influencing the crew and the magus to sin and damnation. One or more of the crew are possessed by a demon. Carles Magnus suspects that something infernal may be trying to influence his crew but does not know of the possession directly. See below for more details. Poverty (Minor Resource Hook): The covenant is young, with few resources. It has the Minor variant of the Poverty Hook and starts with a single Lesser Income Source, providing 40 Mythic Pounds per year. The magi may need to resolve that early on as the covenant currently runs a deficit.''

He can only retain one such ability at a time; if he adopts an ability while he still retains another, then the first ability disappears.

==Through The Aegis Magi==

''Six magi sail the Northern Seas, two of which are experienced and represent the driving forces behind the covenant, while the remaining four are young and starting out in their magical careers. These four younger magi make for good player characters as none have taken familiars, enchanted talismans, or significantly modified their laboratories, leaving players with scope in those areas.''
''Carles Magnus of House Tytlaus''
''Carles grew up hearing tales of Hermetic daring, of magi pushing against the limits of magic, each other, and the natural order of the world itself. His master was itinerant, however, and his apprenticeship was spent traveling between Tribunals, but it was at sea that he was happiest. Something about it suited his magic and temperament and he eventually earned great wealth through pragmatic piracy and acquiring things for other magi that they could never get for themselves. This has given him something of a reputation, not always for the good. Carles has ambitions to found his own Tribunal of the Northern Seas, with himself''
''as its Praeco. Through the last forty years, he has developed a daring plan and his flotilla covenant is the first stage. His Tribunal will encompass all the waters between the shores of Hibernia, Stonehenge, Loch Leaglean, the Rhine, Normandy, and Provençal, and all the lands beneath the seas, and the sky above. Giving the covenant members a degree of freedom is part of his strategy. He intends them to gain their own followers, larger or more numerous ships, to control shipping lanes, etc. In essence, he wants them to outgrow his covenant and leave to found their own.''
''Hilde Oddfish of House Bjornaer''
''Hilde Oddfish has a problem. Her shark Heartbeast rages so fiercely that the only place she feels safe is at sea. It is not just her own safety that concerns her. The giant’s blood running through her veins, the berserk fury that seethes behind her eyes, and the lack of control she has over her magic combine to make Hilde an unpredictable woman to be around. She knows this and holds it all back as far as she can, but cannot ultimately fight what she is.''

The shark is an unattractive beast, hence its low Presence score. However, its Loathsome Appearance Quality makes it fearsome and its Presence is treated as +3 for the purposes of intimidation. If using City & Guild, attacks by her Inner Heartbeast are sufficient to cause ships to make damage rolls.''

''Sharks are solitary creatures and Hilde’s one concession to humanity is her loyalty to Carles and she most often sails close to him. Carles may, however, send Hilde to accompany one of the other magi if he suspects anything untoward or underhanded, banking on Hilde’s presence to be enough to bring wayward youngsters into line. A member of Clan Maruhs, Hilde lives the life of a wanderer. Rebellious even to her clan, she has turned her back on their traditional magical leanings, distancing herself from them. She has no sept as the solitary aspect of her shark heartbeast asserts itself. See Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults for more on House Bjornaer clans and septs. Hilde sought out her Bjornaer ancestor several years ago and initiated one of the Inner Mysteries of her House that further enhances her heartbeast. She still retains the scarring on her side, in both human and shark form, caused by her first encounter with that ancient and powerful shark.''
''Columba of Ex Miscellanea''
''Columba served her apprenticeship in House Guernicus, but even in the earliest years of her apprenticeship, she knew that a life in that House was not what she wanted. It was during the year before her Gauntlet that she met Carles Magnus and she saw in him an opportunity for freedom. They agreed that Carles would find her a sponsor within House Ex Miscellanea and the day before she was due to take her Gauntlet examination, she fled her covenant to Carles’ ship on the coast and they sailed for Stonehenge, where she was accepted into House Ex Miscellanea by Benedic of Oxeney. From there, they sailed south to Iberia where she stayed for several years before returning to Carles, bringing a book with her. This polemic on the founding of a new Tribunal draws upon her own study of the code and upon Carles’ grand scheme, supporting her own ambition to found a new Tribunal. The cross-House and cross-Tribunal nature of Columba’s flight meant that no charges of deprivation of magical power were brought, but her former parens has never forgiven the insult. Columba has the Tormenting Master Flaw and fate conspires to place Columba and her former Guernicus parens, Roman de Troyes, in the same place at the same time rather more frequently than chance alone would dictate.''
''Matilda Page of House Verditius''
''Matilda Page was born and schooled in the Stonehenge Tribunal and, perhaps unwisely, her master allowed her to maintain contact with her birth family. This resulted in Matilda’s wealthy, but troublesome, parents, siblings, and cousins arriving at her master’s door on more than one occasion. This is perhaps why Matilda was so keen to run away to sea. Matilda’s interest was piqued by Carles’ tales of a wreck of a knarr laying on the seabed. This old viking ship, covered in magical runes as used by the wizards of the icy north, is now a source of vis. To Matilda, the wreck represents not just a source of vis, but also inspiration to pursue the Elder Verditius Runes and beyond. She believes the runes themselves to be magical, the true source of the vis. Her own craft is as an illuminator and her devices are always etched, engraved, or otherwise decorated with perfectlyformed script or images. She is particularly fond of charged devices and any potions or salves that she creates look and taste suspiciously like ink.''
''She is keen to learn the mystery of Enchant Casting Tools (Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 123) once her Arts have improved as she believes this to be a means of enhancing her magical power quickly and efficiently. Jealous of the Rusticani ex Miscellanea tradition, who are able to craft charged items without spending a whole season on the exercise, she one day intends to integrate, research, or initiate her own version of the Rusticani Craft Magic Virtue (as described in Houses of Hermes, Societates, page 130). Mindful that others of her House might see this as a betrayal of their crafts and mysteries, she has not shared this information with any other Verditius.''
''Tibor Milos of House Tremere''
''As Carles Magnus began to make a name for himself, a clerk within House Tremere started to question just what the Tytalus magus was doing. He seemed to put into port but rarely and had distanced himself from the politics and contests of his native Normandy Tribunal. The clerk went to his superiors with an outlandish suggestion; Carles Magnus was laying the foundation for a new''

''Devices''
''Matilda has a penchant for charged devices, particularly scrolls that she can either use herself without going to the trouble of spell-casting or to give to grogs and let them sort themselves out. She has developed the following scrolls, for which she retains the laboratory texts:''
''3 scrolls of Bind Wounds (as per ArM5, page 129), CrCo 10 (+0 penetration) 1 scroll of Pilum of Fire (as per ArM5, page 140), CrIg 20 (+20 penetration) 1 scrolls of Circular Ward Against Demons (as per ArM5, page 162), ReVi 15 (+20 penetration) 2 scrolls of Wreaths Of Foul Smoke (as per ArM5, page 125) CrAu 10 (+0 penetration) These are activated by opening them and speaking the illuminated trigger word or phrase written upon the scroll in Latin.

''Creating Poetry''
''You can find more detail in the Art & Academe supplement, but here is a brief summary of the rules needed for Andrew to create new works of poetry. Unlike study sources, poems generate an Aesthetic Quality instead of a Source Quality. This is determined as follows:''
''Aesthetic Quality: Communication + Craft: Poetry + bonuses''
''The bonuses include (but are not limited to):''
''• Virtues like Inspirational and Free Expression add a +3 bonus. • An artist can double the time it takes to create a piece of artwork and receive a +1 bonus. • An artist can work overtime, taxing his physical and mental resources throughout the course of the artwork’s creation. He receives a +1 bonus, but must make an Aging roll as soon as the artwork is completed. • An artist can add one third of his Artes Liberales score (rounded up) to a piece of artwork that somehow incorporates knowledge of one of the liberal arts.''
''The poet determines their story, and the troupe determines which standard Abilities this covers. Area Lore, Magic Lore, Faerie Lore, Order of Hermes Lore, etc. are all valid subjects that a poem written by a Hermetic magus might touch upon. A new work of poetry typically takes at least one season to create. The actual length of time taken is one season multiplied by the Aesthetic Quality / 10, rounded up. Artists use this work as a study source for the associated artistic Ability with a source quality equal to the work’s Aesthetic Quality divided by 2. Others may read the poem and gain exposure experience (two experience points) in any of the Abilities that the work involves. Chapter Eight of Art & Academe provides more details and options to support Andrew’s artistic ambitions.''

''Tribunal. Of course, the notion was incredible – there was no land to claim, no kingdoms by which to mark a border, and any auras would be transient at best. The clerk received short shrift and, as far as Coeris was concerned, the matter was closed. However, the clerk had a filius who had just taken his Gauntlet. This Tibor Milos was assigned by his parens to the Covenant of the Northern Seas to act as House Tremere’s eyes and ears within what could be a unique political situation. Tibor is a man with two problems. Firstly, he is beholden to his parens and must report back on the covenant’s activities. Secondly, he carries the curse of lycanthropy. When the moon is full, he turns body and mind into a savage wolf. However, he is prepared and he has brought his companion, Laszlo, who is also his translator, who oversees his confinement on the appropriate nights. Laszlo is described below. At present, Tibor must send communications back to his parens by mundane means, such as using merchant houses or redcaps to transport messages. In time, he intends to invent or acquire a magical means of achieving the same. Despite herself, Hilde is intrigued by Tibor’s lycanthropy, although this is in much''
''the same way a shark is intrigued by something strange bobbing about in the water.''
''Andrew of Jerbiton''
''Andrew is a dreamer in search of adventure, but adventure in which his companions confront the dangers that he can then record. That’s not to say that Andrew is a coward, far from it. He simply has a welldeveloped sense of his role and that role is to facilitate the efforts of others, to inspire them to great deeds and to record them for posterity. There is no better place to do this than on the Northern Seas with what to him is a band of heroic adventurers. Andrew finds magic harder when not touching his target, but he has control over his spells such that he can vary the Range, Duration, or Target up or down by one magnitude, and he uses these spells principally to assist his companions. This is Andrew’s modus operandi; facilitating others so that he may support and, importantly, observe. As helpful as he is, he is often unprepared for the basics. His satchel contains many things that might once have served a purpose or might spark a conversation, but almost never contains what he needs. Luckily, he has no difficulty imposing upon''
''the generosity of others. He has a passion for poetry and intends to record his adventures in the form of chansons de gesta, epic poems concerning heroic deeds, as described in Art & Academe, page 117. These typically take a season to create and a summary of the rules is provided below. Andrew knows Matilda from their shared background in Stonehenge and he quite likes the strange bookish woman. In fact, he’d quite like to see if Matilda’s magic can help improve his own poetry in the way that magically refining books improves them as a study source.''

==Notable Covenfolk==

''Like other covenants, the Northern Seas has its share of companions and grogs and like other covenants not all of these characters live or travel with the magi.''

He also holds five pawns of Divine Perdo vis, as described later in this chapter. Appearance: Otto is rugged and tanned despite his apparent vocation as a clerk. He has an easy smile and a resolute brow and''
''his still-thick hair is turning from brown to gray. When at home, he wears robes appropriate to a clerk and keeps his armor, traveling clothes, and weapons upstairs in his chamber.''
''The objects of virtue and the vis listed above are bought with the covenant’s Build Points; 5 Build Points for each of the enriched items and 1 Build Point for the 5 pawns of Divine Perdo vis. Any creature with an Infernal Might of 25 or less struck with the Fennel of Virtue lose 5 points of Infernal Might (Penetration +35) at the cost of one of Otto’s Fatigue Levels. In carrying the Clach Crubain close to him, Otto gains the Lesser Immunity (Arthritis) Minor Supernatural Virtue, but gains warping through being under a constant magical effect. These are described in more detail in Realms of Power: Magic, pages 126 and 127. Otto’s personal library includes four books upon the subject of the supernatural realms. These are available to the covenant, although he has the only copies and does not allow them to leave his premises. Otto lives with his housekeeper, the young widow Madamoiselle Katarine Tempête, who occasionally assists him on his adventures.''

==Through The Aegis Companions==

''The covenant has few companions as such but the characters described below fill those roles. Where the Northern Seas is adopted as a player covenant, these companions would make ideal player characters.''

==Dolly Price==

''The port of Southampton on Stonehenge’s south coast is a busy place and sea captains vie with the king’s men to avoid taxes on goods in and out of the country. One woman happily plays one side against the other and makes profit of it; Dolly Price. While she has sailed with Carles in the past, she sees her place as firmly on dry land, running her dockside lodging house known locally as the Inn on the Wharf. It is a place where hard men of the sea come for comfort and the wealthy come to escape the city’s watchful eye. The Inn is sometimes violent, but slight as she is Dolly is more than a match for trouble.''
''An ally to the covenant, Dolly is socially connected with a network of agents along the coast and beyond who feed information back to her. She has enemies within the king’s men, enemies that might well close her down but for the protection she enjoys from Carles. She also has the touch of magic about her and her Entrancement power helps her to get what she wants from those she encounters.''
''Otto-Pauels''
''Otto is an adventurer at heart. Despite his years and the occasional attack of arthritis, he is still fit, and as much as he tells himself that his impetuous days are behind him, adventure always conspires to lure him out for one last job. He is a learned man and has applied this learning to matters of the unseen world. Outside of the Order, Carles knows of few men who know as much of the four realms as Otto does, especially when it comes to the undead.''

''Otto spends his days in his Boulogne home and office as a clerk, but supplements his income with commissions from all comers to investigate the strange, the untimely, and the impossible. His office is also the covenant’s nominal council chamber as required by Normandy convention.''
''Laszlo''
''Laszlo is a loyal servant of House Tremere and the guardian of Tibor Milos. He is no grog, however, for he is Custos; trusted and respected and first among covenfolk. He has traveled extensively in his time and learned a little of many languages. But it is not this that selected him for the role of Tibor’s man. It was his uncanny ability to speak with the animals. Laszlo has always had a deep understanding and affinity with the beasts of the world and given Tibor’s curse, this ability makes him valuable. He is a pensive man and given rather more to the night than the day. He suspects that’s what tends to make others suspicious of his motives.''

==Grogs==

''The description of a base covenant in ArM5, page 71 provides for about one grog (fighter) per magus and about two other servants of various trades or professions. The servants are likely to include clerks and cabin-boys to fetch and carry for the magus. These are not detailed here and you should consider the Urchin statistics in Apprentices, page 30 for any young cabin-boys in the fleet. Of the named grogs described nearby, you can assume that each of the covenant’s six magi have one on board their ship with them. Players may like to decide among themselves which of these grogs they claim.''

Encumbrance: 3 (3) Appearance: If there is a way to tie or buckle something wrong and still be wearing it, Feeble finds a way. He bears a look of surprised confusion whenever spoken to and his first instinct is to look for someone to answer for him. This is of course in part because of his bashfulness over his stammer.''
''Feeble by name, but not necessarily by capability. He is highly-proficient with the spear and his task is usually to close off an enemy’s lines of attack or retreat. He lacks imagination and so when given a task he is happy to continue in that task until told to stop, including during combat.''

==Bullcalf==

''Bullcalf is the backbone of the turb. Aside from the hulking Hilde, Bullcalf is the largest and strongest person in the covenant. He has a temper, is quick to anger, and is easily outwitted.''
''Characteristics: Int –1, Per –1, Pre +1, Com –1, Str +4, Sta +2, Dex 0, Qik 0 Size: +1 Age: 30 (30) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk; Berserk, Great Strength, Large; Missing Ear, Uncontrollable Strength*, Wrathful * From the Grogs supplement Personality Traits: Brave +3, Angry +1, Dim +1 Combat: Dodge: Init +0, Attack n/a, Defense +4/+2, Damage n/a Fist: Init +0, Attack +4/+6, Defense +4/+2, Damage +4 Kick: Init –1, Attack +5/+7, Defense +4/+2, Damage +7 Bludgeon: Init +0, Attack +6/+8, Defense +4/+2, Damage +6 Knife: Init +0, Attack +5/+7, Defense +4/+2, Damage +6 Hammer: Init +1, Attack +7/+9, Defense +4/+2, Damage +12 Warhammer: Init +0, Attack +12/+14, De''

Oh, and he’s got an ear off.''
''Bullcalf carries a heavy warhammer, which he uses to devastating effect, especially when his berserk fury takes over. In combat, Bullcalf is the grog at the center of the action. There is no telling which enemy he is going to attack next, it likely switches every round, and in doing so he is frightening and intimidating. To both sides.''

==Silence==

''A thief and a rogue, Silence is more used to subtlety and stealth than open brawling. He is often employed on tasks where his skills of stealth and legerdemain come in useful. He can often be seen, on his own, practicing his athletic and climbing prowess, sprinting, and throwing knives at targets.''
''Characteristics: Int 0, Per +1, Pre –2, Com –2, Str 0, Sta 0, Dex +5, Qik +3 Size: 0 Age: 26 (26) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk; Great Dexterity × 2; Covenant Upbringing, Master of None* * From the Grogs supplement Personality Traits: Brave +3, Disciplined +2, Self-Interest +1, Honorable –1 Combat: Dodge: Init +2, Attack n/a, Defense +6, Damage n/a Fist: Init +2, Attack +8, Defense +6, Damage +0 Kick: Init +1, Attack +8, Defense +5, Damage +3 Dagger: Init +2, Attack +11, Defense +7, Damage +3 Throwing Knife: Init +2, Attack +10, Defense +7, Damage +2 Soak: +1 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+) Abilities: Athletics 4 (acrobatics), Awareness 3 (search), Brawl 3 (dagger), Organization Lore: Covenant of the Northern Seas 1 (people), Disguise 2 (peasants), English 3 (slang), Folk Ken 2 (grogs), Latin 2 (overheard speech), Legerdemain 4 (pilfering), French 5 (Norman), Stealth 5 (urban areas), Swim 2 (stay afloat), Thrown Weapon 3 (throwing knife) Equipment: Dark clothes and short traveling cloak; Pack; Rope; Quilted Armor; Dagger; Throwing knives Encumbrance: 1 (1) Appearance: Fit and wiry.''
''Silence prefers to use his throwing knives in combat. If these don’t slow his opponent enough, he is always mindful of finding an exit and coming back more prepared. He works well with Fang, with the brawler grappling an opponent to the ground and then Silence coming in with a well-placed dagger.''

==Shadow Shadow is well-named as he has vowed never to willingly leave his magus’ side. This serious-minded man has trained all his life to be the best possible shield grog he can manage.==

Beneath the brim of his iron helmet his eyes watch for any threat to his magus and he is often seen holding people at arm’s length until given permission to approach his magus, even those people the magus knows. He carries a large rectangular shield that some have quipped is very nearly a field pavise.''
''Unless ordered otherwise, Shadow remains with his magus while in combat, standing off a safe distance and placing himself between his magus and harm. For this reason, he is unlikely to join a combat group and never presses a combat advantage; doing so might leave an opening through which he master might be harmed. Shadow considers himself armored enough to take whatever punishment comes his way.''

==Fang Fang is a brawler and likes to get in close and grapple. He has a tendency to bite his opponents, claiming it takes the fight out of them, though even his closest friends state it is his foul odor responsible for that. Fang has a weakness for drink and indulges whenever he is given the opportunity, which almost always ends in him becoming embroiled in one fight or another.==

His armor is loose and filthy, possibly more use for carrying chunks of bread and cheese inside for when he gets hungry. He does have an ax and a shield, but frequently forgets them and so is just as often seen without them as with.''
''Fang enjoys grappling and brawling, which makes for an effective means of subduing enemies rather than hacking at them indiscriminately.''

==Through The Aegis Specialists and Other Covenfolk==

''A ship cannot function without her crew, so use these statistics for the crewmembers, regardless of which ship in the fleet you need them for.''
''Ship’s Captain''
''Given their importance, each ship’s captain is bought as a Specialist from the Covenant’s Build Points. These individuals are described below alongside their ships, but a standard statistics block is provided nearby. Each sea captain costs 5 Build Points.''
''Sailor''
''The Sailors Free Choice Covenant Boon describes the main body of the covenfolk. As per the description of the Boon, each sailor costs the covenant a penny each day. At around a dozen sailors per ship, across six ships, that’s a total of 6 shillings each day and around 110 Mythic Pounds per year. These sailors do not have a Build Point cost as they have little bearing on play beyond carrying out duties on board the ships.''
''Specialists''
''The covenant does not generally take its specialists with it, which means that the covenant must visit certain ports in order to use the services provided by their specialists. These invariably are Carles’ social contacts, all either paid by the covenant for prompt and preferential treatment or in debt to Carles and Hilde in some way. These specialists are always prepared to take on unusual or even dangerous commissions The following specialists are available, and unless otherwise marked they each cost 6 Build Points for their highest primary Ability. The Chaplain: Clovis knows enough of the Order to know that they frequently endanger their own souls and the souls of those around them. While he tends his parish near St. Malo, he may occasionally sail with the covenant if asked. He is useful as a messenger, a mediator, a neutral party, and as a conscience. He costs 51 Build Points as this includes the cost of his Bible. The Bible: Summa, Theology (Level 10, Quality 3), Summa, Church Lore (Level 3, Quality 3) The Sail Maker: Stephen is a sail maker working out of his Cherbourg sail loft. While skilled, he lacks the innovation in his workshop to make him stand out, something he intends to ask the covenant for help in.''
''The Carpenter: Hugh is master carpenter with access to wood and timber from across the known world. He is also able to find and pass on exotic wood by request, such as lightning-struck oak, or a cypress upon which a man has hanged for three days. Hugh costs 21 Build Points as this includes a +2 Raw Materials bonus to his workshop. The Rope Maker: Guerrier of Abbeville on the Somme operates a thriving ropewalk. Guerrier costs 21 Build Points as this includes a +2 Innovation bonus to his workshop. Shimon Avraham: Shimon is a prominent tax collector at Barfleur and a strong ally to the covenant. A member of the town’s Jewish community, he owes much to the covenant’s elder magi for help and protection they afforded him and his family some years ago. He can ensure that some cargoes go through the port unchecked and uncounted. He costs 8 Build Points for his Profession: Tax Collector Ability. The Merchants: The covenant has friendly merchants in Antwerp, London, and Paris, which accounts for the stability of their trade and transport income. These three merchants alone may not be able to increase this income, but they do look after the covenant’s interests.''

==Thrice-Dead Ned==

''Thrice-Dead Ned is so called because he has very nearly died in the service of magi at least three times. He considers himself lucky, though others aren’t as sure. He has an astounding constitution that sees him recover from wounds that would have surely killed other men. Years of patching his own wounds have taught him the art of chirurgery and he sees that his fighting friends are well looked after.''

His beard may be gray, his eyes a little rheumy, and he may be a little hard of hearing, but he has a lightness to his step and ready smile.''
''Thrice-Dead Ned benefits from a Stamina of 4 +3 for Rapid Convalescence in all Wound Recovery Rolls, as detailed in ArM5, page 179. He does however have some Aging Points against a few of his characteristics, which puts him at risk during each winter. Ned isn’t clever, but he isn’t stupid either. He knows he’s getting on a bit and prefers to use his crossbow from range, reloading while others keep danger at bay. Ned uses the Crossbow Ability from Lords of Men, page 138, and spans his crossbow using a belt hook.''

==Through The Aegis Covenant Organization==

''Six magi, free from the politics and squabbles of their land-locked cousins, sail the seas and oceans and go where adventure takes them. Each magus is master of his own ship, has a captain to command it, and a crew to sail it. They live and work aboard this vessel and this includes study and laboratory activities. The covenant has a number of contacts on land, mostly in the ports and harbors along the Stonehenge and Normandy coastlines. The covenant sails as a fleet, bearing security in mind and the need to bond the magi together. Given the immediacy of its founding, there has been little time for formal councils, but the magi do meet and agree their course and responsibilities for the season ahead. Each magus flies two flags, the first being the covenant’s symbol of a black Cog on a field of White, and the second being their own symbol in the form of a sanctum marker; after all, their ship is their own domain. Laboratory work is typically conducted with the ship at anchor in one of a score of natural harbors and reefs. A life at sea may be conducive to freedom, but the lack of pervading magical aura across the seas means that laboratory work cannot benefit as on land. Alternatively, magi may trade for a season within an aura controlled by friendly covenants.''

==Hierarchy and Governance==

''There is little of either hierarchy or governance on the Northern Seas. The older of the covenant’s magi have known each other for years and they have a strong bond of friendship, but they are firmly committed to seeing the younger and less experience magi achieve their potential. Each of the magi is, in their own way, an outcast or a misfit, and the Northern Seas provides a welcome harbor from their sea of troubles. Each magus has their vote on the council and must abide by decisions made. The covenant also respects the opinions of its covenfolk and, if they request it, they may speak before the council. Magi are free to study what they will and all are agreed to provide assistance to their colleagues when needed, for instance in exploring where one desires or trading for resources that another might require.''
''Income and Supplies''
''There are few laws at sea and the Northern Seas takes full advantage of this. Merchants and smugglers risk their cargoes to pirates, storms, and the vagaries of the ocean. To these can be added the magi of the Northern Seas. Trade may ultimately make up some of the covenant’s income, but the more experienced of the magi are not above taking what they want from ships that cross their paths.''
''However, the current source of income is from trade; transporting goods from one port to another. On its own, with a fleet of six ships, this should provide a decent income for a wealthy merchant. However, the six ships need to support the same number of magi, which brings its own costs. As described later in the chapter, the small in''

''come from legitimate trade is not yet sufficient to cover these costs. The covenant has a little time to decide, but the magi of the Norther Seas need to determine how they are going to keep the Northern Seas crews paid, ensure the ships are maintained, and buy the all-important devices and equipment used in Hermetic laboratories. Their trade income is there to be developed and piracy is still being debated. The covenant does have its own reserves of silver, a sizable sum in fact, which should support the covenant for a while, but before long the young covenant will need to earn its keep.''
''Study and Laboratory Work''
''The magi of the Northern Seas spend their time as other magi do, in their laboratories, inventing spells, and creating enchanted devices. They face several challenges in this that others do not, principally the lack of a covenant aura and the unusual situation of their laboratories. These laboratories are described in detail later in this chapter and take account of the inherent dangers of trying to work at sea. For particularly delicate work, or in times of severe weather, the magus might choose to anchor up and work from a safe harbor. The lack of aura does not prevent magic from being used of course, but the magi of the Northern Seas do not enjoy the same benefit that other more conventional''
''magi might. However, the magi are charting the seas and looking for stable magical auras which might one day allow them to benefit while at sea.''

==Life At Sea==

''Life at sea is hard enough, but there are distinct challenges for a magus whose career consists of long months of study and delicate laboratory work.''
''Charting The Ocean''
''The magi of the Northern Seas, young as they are, rely upon their elder and more experienced captains for their knowledge of the ocean currents, storm fronts, and treacherous coastlines. These captains do not, however, have knowledge or understanding of the supernatural auras. The magi of the Northern Seas are therefore setting out to chart such auras that can be found both on the surface of the sea and beneath it. Just as a magus on land might find, follow, and exploit a magical stream, so the magi of the Northern Seas believe they can do the same for currents and flows in the ocean. This is not so far-fetched as some land-locked magi might first think. Consider that magical stream and where its waters come from and go. The waters are within that stream for so short a time, and yet they carry magic with them while part of that stream. The same is true for the currents, swirls, and eddies that every captain knows. The deep currents between Iceland and the Faroes may hold older and stronger magical auras than anyone suspects. Each magus has a copy of the Carta Ma''

[|

==The Gift of Magestones==

''While the covenant’s ships lack a magical aura, there exists one tantalizing option; Magestones. The story goes that while Verditius was learning Hermetic magic from Bonisagus he enchanted a number of fist-sized onyx pebbles, each with the two runes for Creo and Vim engraved upon them. These stones each create a localized level 3 magic aura large enough to cover a magus’ laboratory. Apart from a few secretly given to the covenant of Oculus Septentrionalis in the Rhine, Durenmar jealously guards all the remaining stones that they are aware of. However, you may decide that Verditius kept some of these stones back for himself and his followers, and that perhaps he took these stones with him on what became his final sea voyage to ensure that his ship benefited from a magical aura at all times. You may decide that these stones are out there for the finding, perhaps in the hands of mundane nobles who do not know what they have, or in the clutches of Merfolk who might use them to bargain with the magi of the Northern Sea. Perhaps they are in the belly of an enormous whale, grown large and ancient through the action of the magic it carries within itself. Alternatively, you may decide that the precedent set with Oculus Septentrionalis might be repeated and either Durenmar has already given the Northern Seas a set of Magestones or the leaders of House Bonisagus are open to persuasion. Whichever way you approach it, Magestones provide a means of giving each magus in the covenant a valuable magical aura. See Guardians of the Forests, page 70 for more details on Magestones.''

==Story Seed: The Magical Whale==

''Sailing with the covenant for a season, Maris of Tytalus tells tales of an immense whale that brings a magical aura to the surface each time it breaches. A ship tacking alongside can benefit from that aura for a while. Is this just a tall tale of the sea or has Maris discovered a powerful resource? Pressing Maris for more information, Carles asks for volunteers to hunt down the whale and discover the source of its power.''

==Story Seed: The First Contract==

''The covenant has been engaged to take a small cargo of tin from Southampton to Riga. Two nights into the journey, a stowaway is discovered trying to pilfer food. This young girl is no urchin; she is clearly the daughter of someone important. As the magi learn more, it seems that she is fleeing a marriage to an elderly knight arranged by her father for monetary gain. Her sweetheart has already fled her father’s abuses and she is going to Riga to be with him. Can the magi allow themselves to be dragged into this tale of love and loss? What do they do when they discover that this long-lost lover in Riga has himself a new woman? And how do they deal with the angered father now that he has discovered on whose ship she stole away?''

==Story Seed: The First Act of Piracy==

''Having heard of a valuable cargo of silver and other treasures on its way to Denmark, the covenant resolves to take it. When they board the ship, however they find little treasure but a handful of monks on their way to save a village from the curse of devilry and witchcraft. The treasure on board is the sacred relics and paraphernalia that they carry with them. Do the magi take the treasure and leave the monks and the villagers to their fate, or do they take the virtuous path?''

''rina, a map of the ocean, which they update. See additional details on the Carta Marina later in this chapter.''
''The Charter''
''The charter of the Northern Seas is quite light on the kind of detail that other magi might expect. There are no degrees of membership. Here is a description of the principle clauses:''
''• Membership is by accord with the existing members. • A magus accepted by the Northern Seas shares his resources with the covenant and in return is given his share of the covenant’s resources. • Each magus is sworn to provide hospitality to his brothers and sisters in the covenant. • Each magus is master of their own vessel. • Each magus has a single vote at council and the elder magus holds the casting vote. • Each magus is sworn to the covenant for no less than a decade, after which he may leave with his rightful share of the spoils. • A magus who stays with the covenant for twenty years may take his ship and his crew on condition that he funds a replacement. • A magus who stays with the covenant for thirty years may take his ship and crew with no obligation to the covenant. • A magus who stays with the covenant for forty years may claim a shipping route or region of the sea to call his own, shall be accorded the respect due to a fully-recognized covenant, and may charter others to himself.''
''The charter is interesting for the things it doesn’t say. In promoting recognition of rights to a shipping route or a region of the sea after forty years, it implies that such rights would not be recognized before that time. The oldest two magi, Carles and Hilde, supplied the majority of the covenant resources when the six magi formed the covenant, but all took their share. Carles has also shown the way of hospitality by recording all the covenant members on his sanctum marker.''

==Covenant Site==

''The covenant has few true buildings as it is based on a flotilla of ships. Each ship in the covenant is either a cog or hulk up to size +8 (as per City & Guild, page 77) and has a base value of 52 Mythic Pounds for a ship of Standard construction, 104 Mythic Pounds for a ship of Superior construction, or 260 Mythic Pounds for a ship of Excellent construction, which provide a total of 6, 9, and 12 Damage Levels respectively.''

==Life on Board Ship==

''Regardless of type or quality, each ship in the flotilla has a capacity of around 125 tonnes and a crew of 13 including the captain. The grogs described above are additional as they occupy a specific role. None of the ships have so far been enchanted or opened for enchantment by a Hermetic shipwright. Each ship can be affected by the standard Hermetic Structure Target.''
''Anatomy of a Ship''
''Allowing for differences in individual design, the covenant’s ships are approximately 75 feet in length, 25 feet in the beam, and just over 12 feet from keel to deck. This allows for a cargo hold and a single deck. The magus’ laboratory typically occupies the rear of the cargo hold and is secured against accidental intrusion. The single mast descends through the deck and secured at the base of the ship. This is generally made from a single tree to promote strength. The ship is steered principally through adjusting the sail to capture the wind at different angles, thereby pushing the ship where it needs to go. The steering oar at the rear of the vessel allows for fine control. The crew typically sleep on deck, weather permitting, or find space below deck among whatever cargo the ship is carrying.''
''Risk of Damage''
''As per the rules in City & Guild, page 77, each of the ships has a number of Damage Levels. Every time the ship is exposed to an explicit danger there is a chance that the ship may be damaged, losing one of these Damage Levels. These dangers include magical accident or explosion, attack by a sea monster, violent storms or swells, running aground, or collision with another vessel.''
''Laboratories''
''Each ship has been fitted with a laboratory of standard size, roughly 20 feet by 25 feet, which costs the ship 25 tonnes of carrying weight. If using the expanded laboratory rules from the Covenants supplement, each additional point of size costs a further 25 tonnes of carrying weight. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: As per individual magus Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +0, General Quality –1, Upkeep +0, Safety –1, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics –1 Virtues & Flaws: Mobile, Extensive Stores; Cramped, Unstable Specializations: Experimentation +2 Each of these laboratories costs 10 Build Points.''
''Modifying the Ships''
''The magi may wish to modify their ships once the covenant sets sail and their income improves. Options include improving the onboard laboratory using the rules presented in the Covenants supplement, adding a prepared casting space, and enhancing the vessel through enchantments. A Hermetic shipwright could enchant the entire vessel, but even separate devices can affect the ship as a structure. See the Hermetic Projects supplement for more information on these options.''

==La Charytee: Carles Magnus==

''La Charytee is a large cog of Excellent construction, having 12 Damage Levels and providing a bonus of +2 to all sailing activities. She has a distinctive tall tower at the rear of the vessel, the balcony of which is richly painted red.''
''The Reliquary''
''Carles has outfitted La Charytee with a relic; the Long Bone of Epiphanius. With a Faith Score of 3, the relic, which hangs from the mast within a box of excellent quality, has a Divine Might of 30 and scourges all demons that come within 30 feet of the relic. This covers almost the entirety of La Charytee. The Long Bone costs 35 Build Points, which is 30 for the Faith Score and a fur''
''ther 5 for the miraculous power it contains. See the nearby box for more details. See also Realms of Power: The Divine, page 43 for more on relics.''
''Carles’ Laboratory''
''Carles’ laboratory is dominated by the carved and painted map of the oceans and the skies that covers the chamber’s floor and ceiling. It is very tidy; important given that the working spaces are a little cramped in order to expose as much of the great map as possible. While the sanctum marker bears the names of each covenant member, Carles ensures that his laboratory is guarded at all times and that the guard knows not to admit anyone unless explicitly told by Carles or Hilde. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Hilde Oddfish, Columba of Ex Miscellanea, Matilda Page, Tibor Milos, Andrew of Jerbiton Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement''
''+2, General Quality +1, Upkeep +3, Safety +1, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics +2 Virtues & Flaws: Extensive Stores, Lesser Feature (Map), Specimens, Guard, Highly Organized, Mobile, Precious Ingredients; Cramped, Unstable Specializations: Experimentation +2, +1 Longevity Rituals; +1 Intellego; +1 Animal Features: Map These enhancements cost 30 Build Points.''
''Captain''
''La Charytee is captained by Gilot Vallet, a shaven-headed robust man with exacting standards. His Personality Traits are Exacting +3, Loyal to Carles +2, Reckless –1.''

==Marie de Bayonne: Hilde Oddfish==

''The Marie de Bayonne is a flat-bottomed hulk of size +8 and Superior construction, providing 9 Damage Levels and a +1 bonus to sailing rolls when sailing close to shore. She is, however, given to frequent leaks and the crew are often kept busy making good and bailing out.''
''Hilde’s Laboratory''
''Hilde’s laboratory is constantly damp as the Marie de Bayonne has been modified so that the hull remains sound despite the opening from Hilde’s laboratory to the sea. This opening allows Hilde to leave her laboratory directly into the sea in her shark heartbeast, but the water does slosh into the lab during choppy seas, despite an enchantment that keeps the ocean at bay. The ceiling is strung with fish in various states of decomposition, seaweed, and driftwood. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Carles Magnus Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +1, General Quality –1, Upkeep +1, Safety +0, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics +1 Virtues & Flaws: Mobile, Highly Organized, Lesser Feature (Running Water), Extensive Stores, Specimens; Cramped, Lesser Focus (Running Water), Unstable Specializations: Experimentation +2; Animal +1, Aquam +3 These enhancements cost 30 Build Points.''
''Captain''
''The Marie de Bayonne is captained by Taupin le Ribaut, a gray-bearded tyrant who runs a decent God-fearing ship. He’s a fair captain, but woe betide those who fall short of his standards. His Personality Traits are Merciless +3, Pious +2, Loyal to Hilde +1.''

==The Black Bark: Andrew of Jerbiton==

''The Black Bark is a large hulk with 6 Damage Levels. Its hull has been painted pitch black to reflect its name, which immediately provides the ship with a certain presence. There is no mistaking the Black Bark when she rounds into port.''
''Andrew’s Laboratory''
''The laboratory on the Black Bark has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above.''
''Captain''
''The Black Bark is captained by Pierre l’Englais, a vibrant clean-shaven man, secure in the camaraderie he enjoys with his crew. He will gladly lead his crew and risk his ship in any venture, for there is no life but the adventurous life in his mind. His Personality Traits are Adventurous +3, Energetic +2, Cautious –1.''

==The Laurens: Columba==

''The Laurens is a large cog of size +8 and Standard construction, providing 6 Damage Levels. She is wider in the beam than most other vessels, which makes her slower but more stable in rough seas. Her cargo capacity is 25 tons more than the covenant’s other ships, room that could be turned over quite easily to a council chamber of sorts.''
''Columba’s Laboratory''
''The laboratory on the Laurens has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above.''
''Captain''
''The Laurens is captained by a Breton by the name of Tiessot. He has a tendency to walk the ship at night, when things are calm''

==The Long Bone of Saint Epiphanius==

''Saint Epiphanius (died 403) was the bishop of Salamis on the eastern coast of Cyprus and a noted polemicist warning against the dangers of heresy in all its forms. He lived into his eighties and was noted for his mastery of many languages. Carles has acquired the thigh of Epiphanius, which has a Faith Score of 3 and the following miraculous power:''
''Babel Rejoined''
''InMe 40 Pen +8, 2/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Hearing Those in the same structure as the long bone of Epiphanius understand the spoken words of all others within the structure regardless of the languages that any of them speak. To benefit, targets must at least nominally be members of either the western or eastern Churches. Jewish and Islamic characters do not benefit, neither do heretics, pagans, or those aligned with the Infernal. The power is activated by invoking Saint Epiphanius in the presence of the bone, something widely-known by the crew. (Effect: Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +3 Hearing; Modifications: +1 for 2/ day, +4 for +8 penetration) This relic costs 35 Build Points.''

|]
''est, and take his turn on watch. He enjoys these quiet moments when he can be alone with his thoughts. Those thoughts often turn to Columba, a woman he knows he can never have nor ever speak of his affections. His Personality Traits are Thoughtful +3, In love with Columba +2, Protective of his crew +1.''

==Le Genet: Tibor Milos==

''Le Genet is an ocean-going cog that has been patched and repaired many times in her life. She is of Standard construction and has 6 Damage Levels.''
''Tibor’s Laboratory''
''The laboratory on Le Genet has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above. The sanctum is also contains a small cage of iron straps and a strong lock. This is Tibor’s cage into which he goes on those nights he becomes the wolf.''
''Captain''
''Le Genet is captained by Susane la Fèvre, a strong-willed and vocal captain and harsh task master. She feels the need to exert her leadership, but marries this with an ability to hold her drink and to haul a rope as well as any of her crew. She also has no qualms with piracy, and is willing to turn her unease at Tibor’s curse into a fearsome legend of the sea-wolf if it helps her cause. Of all the captains sailing for the Northern Seas, Susane is perhaps the most loyal to her own path over that of the covenant’s. Her Personality Traits are Garrulous +3, Showy +1, Loyal to the Covenant –2.''

==Trinite: Matilda Page==

''Unlike the other ships in the covenant, Trinite is a Mediterranean nef, long bodied with a sturdy keel and towers for and aft. The ship is a gift from the Merfolk to Carles and was once a wreck that laid for many years on the seabed. This gives the ship a weathered patina that Matilda finds pleasing. Trinite has triangular lateen sails, that allow it to tack closer to the wind, meaning it can outpace similarly-sized vessels when sailing into the wind. She has 6 Damage Levels but receives a –1 penalty to any Damage Checks while in the northern oceans. Her Mediterranean design does not fully suit the rougher seas of the north.''
''Matilda’s Laboratory''
''The laboratory onboard Trinite has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above. It is situated to the rear of the vessel below decks. Matilda also has an additional workshop in the forecastle at the bow. She calls this her reading room, though actually it is where she practices her scribing and illumination. Her hand has adapted to the constantly-rolling motion of the sea and she is now as accomplished on board Trinite as she is on land, though she suspects that there may be magical means of improving her laboratory to aid with the development of enchanted devices; perhaps a mechanism to keep her workspaces steady no matter the conditions outside.''
''Captain''
''The ship is captained by Sarrasin, a Frenchman of Moorish ancestry. His manner, dress, and language mark him out as a Frenchman and any prejudice concerning his descent is soon eased and so he lacks the Outsider Flaw that might normally be expected. His Personality Traits are Patient +3, Paternal to his crew +2, Respectful +1.''

==External Relations==

''No covenant operates alone and the Northern Seas has its share of allies, rivals, and enemies.''
''Merfolk''
''This race of aquatic faeries are anatomically similar to humans from the waist up, but they have a fish-like tail from the waist down. They also breathe water like a fish, having gills located just behind the jawline, often obscured in male Merfolk by prodigious tightly-curled beards. Merfolk have a tendency to the barbaric, though they might claim adventurous instead. Warfare between the different tribes of the sea is a part of everyday life, so much so that a young Merfolk boy does not become a man until he has made his first kill, whether that is another Merfolk, a great beast of the deep, or a human from the world above. Merfolk fight with the trident and net, often using the net to capture their enemies alive, so that they might be sacrificed to their gods. The magi of the Northern Seas have an uneasy alliance with the capricious Merfolk. The mutual respect was initiated not by Carles’ politicking but by the Merfolk’s awe at Hilde’ shark heartbeast. A warband chanced upon Hilde one day and tried to slay the shark. After Hilde had killed seven of her assailants, the others surrendered to the victor. Hilde is now viewed with reverence, like a legendary hero who walks among them. For her part, Hilde claims to find this all a bit unsettling. Regardless, the Merfolk recognize the ships of the Northern Seas and leave them to their business. Use the Triton statistics for Merfolk, as provided in Realms of Power: Faerie, page 90.''
''The Covenant of Favonius''
''The covenant of Favonius in the Tribunal of Thebes is, like the Northern Seas, housed on several ships. Like the Northern Seas it also has contacts and properties on dry land. But it differs from the Northern Seas in two important ways; Favonius has the power to enchant its ships and it is ideologically wedded to the current status quo with regards to Tribunals.''

[|

==Story Seed: The Rusted Bars==

''All iron rusts and corrodes at sea, but never as quickly as that fateful night. Although Tibor retired to his cage at the onset of the wolf, the bars quickly crumbled and broke under the wolf’s attack. This freed Tibor and the wolf had free rein all over Le Genet. Are the crew able to safely recapture their transformed master? Was the rusting of the bars natural or was there a malicious power at work? Who would want to seed fear and mistrust within the Northern Seas?''

|]
''Carles has discussed both of these with the Favonius’ leader and principal enchanter, Memnos and hopes one day to both commission an enchanted vessel from him and to persuade him to throw off the Tribunal of Thebes and strive for freedom. For their part, Favonius sees Carles and his magi as following in their wake and wish them nothing but favorable winds and smooth sailing.''
''John Padbury of House Verditius''
''John Padbury is a Verditius with a dream. He is a carpenter and budding shipwright attempting to establish a small Hermetic shipyard in Smallhythe in the Stonehenge Tribunal. At present, he is working on his own with a small and hard-pressed band of mundane carpenters and has nothing even approaching the kind of expansive and open laboratory he needs. If Carles and the Northern Seas are keen to help him, however, he is willing to repay the debt in kind by providing such enchantments that they might request. Smallhythe is a little way inland, but the river that runs to the small town is deep enough that coastal busses, hulks, and unladen cogs can navigate quite easily. It is a place already well established in shipbuilding.''
''Feliadexter, Demon of Wrath''
''This demon of wrath has possessed one of the crew, placing a portion of its Might into the unwitting sailor, from where it hides and pushes others to wrathful or spiteful actions. Where there is a choice between the virtuous path and the path of sin, Feliadexter tempts, or suggests, or calls for violent or sinful acts. When a thief is caught, Feliadexter’s voice is the one calling out from the back for the thief to be mutilated or hanged, his is the eye that spies a laden merchant ship on the horizon, and his is the finger that points out a cheat. This possessing spirit could be in any of the crew. It can hide safe and secure within its host, shielded even from the scourging effects of relics. For this reason it is not specified on which ship the demon sails or even whether the demon has joined the covenant at this point.''
''Captain Folpert Berlensis''
''Captain Folpert Berlensis (Tales of Mythic Europe, page 43), master and owner of the mundane vessel La Main Blanche, is engaged in Hermetic trade in some small way. He is known to the magi along the Normandy and Rhine coast and can often be encountered transporting esoteric cargoes. Lacking the insight that a magus can bring to such services, he nonetheless takes trade that the Northern Seas might on occasion prefer for itself.''
''With Folpert so well-known to the Order, acts of piracy against him and his vessel would hardly be wise, but they do sail the same waters and encounters are inevitable.''
''Waddenzee''
''The covenant of Waddenzee in the Rhine Tribunal are rivals to the Northern Seas by virtue of operating their piracy in waters sailed by Carles and his followers. Although the covenant itself is housed on land, the magi of Waddenzee are notorious pirates and may not think twice about trying to take from the Northern Seas. If things were different, Waddenzee, with its reliance on ships, would make an ideal partner to Carles in founding a new Tribunal, but he cannot in all conscience include them in his plans for fear of the aggression and plunder that might follow.''
''Oculus Septentrionalis''
''The Rhine covenant of Oculus Septentrionalis was founded with the intention of extending the Rhine Tribunal’s reach northwards. While this has stalled, the covenant, along with others of similar mind, are examining the possibility of seceding from the Rhine and forming their own Tribunal. At first glance, this looks like a good fit for the Northern Seas. However, these covenants, and Oculus in particular, would bring too much history and politics to the venture to secure a decent start. However, Estrid Danesson of House Ex Miscellanea is a young magus and has a lifestyle very similar to those of the Northern Seas. It may be possible to persuade Estrid to leave Oculus and join the Northern Seas, which would bring new knowledge to the covenant, if only Estrid’s wife could be persuaded to leave her current life to start a new one.''

His mouth is forced open so far that his head always tips back, and out of it spills a massive tongue as wide around as a grog’s arm. The tongue flails around and it is this he uses in combat as a whip.''
''The possessing spirit of Feliadexter has a Possession Pool of 15, which should be used in place of the Might Score listed above. Points from this Possession Pool are not regained. His Possession power has no other Might cost other than the points Feliadexter chooses to place within the host. This means that the demon can jump between hosts with no loss of power and, as the part has the powers of the whole, even split off further possessing spirits and place them within additional crewmembers.''

==Resources==

''The Covenant of the Northern Seas has the following resources.''

==Income Sources==

''Trade and transport are the chief sources of income for the covenant and this is treated as a Lesser Income Source, earning 40 Mythic Pounds each year. This is insufficient to sustain the covenant.''
''Enchanted Devices''
''The following enchanted devices are available. Unless otherwise stated, the troupe may decide upon which ship they can be found.''
''Brooch of Lungs of the Fish''
''MuAq 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part This brooch affects the wearer as per the Lungs of the Fish spell described in ArM5, page 122. The effect is constantly active and so the user simply needs to wear it to benefit. The covenant has only one of these at present but the Laboratory Text is available. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) This device costs 10 Build Points.''
''The Freshwater Barrel''
''PeAq 20 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual This barrel, when filled once per day from the sea, destroys the saltiness property of the seawater caught within it. Both Carles and Hilde each have one of these devices and the Laboratory Text is available. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Touch) These devices together cost 16 Build Points.''
''The Master’s Chart''
''Carles possesses an arcane connection to each ship in the fleet in the form of a carved miniature made from the wood of their frames. When these are individually placed onto this enchanted map, which is the triggering mechanism, the miniatures sail to their appropriate locations. Hilde knows of this map, and Matilda Page suspects, having found a recently cut section of Trinite’s keel. Hilde has a copy of the laboratory text for this device, which was commissioned from a magus of Verdi in the Roman Tribunal. The chart has two effects. The first finds the fleet through individual arcane connections to the vessels placed upon the chart. The second uses the information provided by the first to move these wooden tokens to their appropriate place on the chart. The large chart of wood and parchment has been opened with eight pawns of vis and the two enchantments currently use four of those pawns. This device costs 12 Build Points. Finding the Fleet''
''InHe 14 Pen +0, 12/day R: Arcane Connection: D: Momentary, T: Individual Provides information on the location of a target ship given an arcane connection to it. (Effect: Base 2, +4 Arcane Connection; Modifications: +4 for 12/day)''
''Mark the Fleet ReHe 11 Pen +0, 12/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual Moves the token placed upon the chart to the location indicated by the Finding the Fleet effect. (Effect: Base 3, +1 Touch; Modifications: +4 for 12/day, +3 triggered by Finding the Fleet)''

==Story Seed: The Fall of the Mercantile Families==

''When a series of sustained pirate attacks along the Rhine coast threatens to bring down several prominent mercantile trading families, the Northern Seas must act to protect its monetary interests. When it becomes clear that the covenant of Waddenzee is responsible, the covenant has some hard decisions to make. On their own, they may not be strong enough to oppose Waddenzee, but can they find aid from other covenants similarly affected and similarly intimidated? Perhaps the covenant could instead persuade these separate families to band together and coordinate their activities and their wealth for the protection of all.''

|]
''Bell of Summoning''
''CrIm 30 Pen +0, 12/day R: Arcane Connection, D: Diameter, T: Individual Commissioned from a Verditius working out of Verdi, when rung this bell sounds throughout all six ships of the fleet, using up six of its 12 uses. This allows the bell to be rung twice with effect. The bell is housed on La Charytee to be rung when Carles gets to port ahead of a council meeting. The bell is usually rung twice in succession, once to alert the magi and again to give them chance to locate the direction of the magic using their Magical Astrolabes, described below. (Effect: Base 1, +4 Arcane Connection, +1 Diameter; Modifications: +4 for 12/day, +16 for +32 penetration) This device costs 12 Build Points.''
''The Magical Astrolabe''
''InVi 40 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual When used against an active magical effect, the astrolabe allows the user to determine the horizontal and vertical directions of the magic’s origins. It cannot provide distance information. The device is used to locate the source of the sound of the Bell of Summoning. When used in conjunction with charts, this provides a confident view on where the bell is. Each ship in the fleet is issued with one of these devices. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch, +3 for increased information; Modifications +10 unlimited use) Individually these devices cost 16 Build Points. There are six of them, for a total of 96 Build Points.''

==Library==

''Given the covenant of the Northern Seas’ unusual makeup, it does not have a library that other magi might recognize; there are no alcoves, no lecterns, and no dedicated librarian. At present, the covenant’s books are either distributed among the magi or lodged with Otto-Pauels in Boulogne and magi must travel there either to study or to take books away with them. It is surely a situation that cannot continue and the young covenant would do well to''
''consider their arrangements. It is possible that a magus willing to maintain the library aboard their ship may secure certain favor from the covenant in return.''
''Arcane Abilities''
''The covenant has several books on the Realm Lore Abilities, in addition to Magic Theory, Finesse, Parma Magica, and Penetration.

''Laboratory Texts''
''Many of the covenant’s magi brought their own Laboratory Texts with them when they joined the covenant, so there are a large number of spells and effects to choose from.

==Vis Sources==

''The Northern Seas has few confirmed and stable vis sources and the magi may want to search for more during the covenant’s early years. Those sources that they know about and regularly collect from are described below. Most however, are not within Normandy’s traditional boundaries and so these have not yet been declared. Columba and Carles agree that they fall outside of Normandy’s interest and this has yet to be challenged at Tribunal.''
''Fire From the Sky''
''10 Pawns of Terram per Year Once a year, the freezing winds sweep down from the north and build over several days, culminating in a thunderous hail storm over the northern seas. In among the stinging hailstones are, on average, ten fist-sized spheres of burning granite that arrive out of the sky like thunderbolts. The magi sail into the storm so that they can quickly locate the burning stones as they fall, using magic to capture them in the air, or to send divers down to the seabed to collect them. The stones can damage any ships they strike, but the magi must sail close and act quick if they are to profit from the venture as the stones lose their vis if not collected within the night. The storm always happens in winter, but it takes an Intelligence + Artes Liberales (Astrology) roll to determine where and how long the magi have to reach it. A low roll leaves the covenant little time to reach the site of the storm and the magi may need to find other ways to get there in time. This source costs 50 Build Points.''
''The Kraken’s Egg''
''5 Pawns of Animal each Year A giant kraken rises from the deep every spring to feed and to lay a single egg. It arrives predictably enough two hundred miles southwest of La Rochelle, but it isn’t always clear where she’ll go. Magi may witness the kraken hunting whales or even ships, both of which form a season of useful insight for those studying Animal. This propensity to attack ships is a danger to the covenant, so magi would be advised not to sail too close and to consider strongly whether to intervene when another ship is attacked. Eventually, at some point toward the end of the season, she dives again and leaves behind a single egg that floats on the tide. This''
''smooth translucent leathery pouch the size of a grain sack contains five pawns of Animal vis. If left in the sea, the egg develops into a new kraken that hatches the following year, losing the vis. If taken from the sea, the egg does not develop and the vis is preserved. This source costs 25 Build Points.''
''The Summer Fog''
''5 Pawns of Mentem vis each Year On the last day of July, the inhabitants of the troubled village of Sønder Vorupør shut up their doors and windows against the horrors of the night, for a fog rolls in from the North Sea bringing nightmares with it. Those caught in the fog suffer the effect described below. Magi, however, may collect the fog, gaining on average five pawns of Mentem vis each year. Curiously, the vis itself does not appear to carry the effect, though taking the vis does dissipate it and save the villagers from their nightmares. The fog may be manipulated through Rego Auram effects and the vis is collected in large leather bags.''
''The Unbidden Horrors CrMe 20 Pen +10, 1/day''
''R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual Individuals touched by the fog feel unease, rising to dread, through suspicion and fear, and into the horror of their deepest nightmares. The effect lasts through the night, and the screams of those unlucky cursed few can be heard throughout the village of Sønder Vorupør. The memories of the experience live longer than the effects of the magic itself. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; Modifications: +5 for +10 Penetration) This source costs 25 Build Points.''
''The Black Horse of Boulogne''
''Four pawns of Rego vis each year. Otto-Pauels knows of a secret pool where a black stallion of enormous size comes every autumn. The horse is of such an unnatural blackness that it can scarcely been seen in the night when it comes. But the horse must once have been tamed for it wears shoes of iron. Each year, the stallion comes to the pool in the clearing and, invisible against the night, it drinks from the pool. If, during its visit, it spies a set of new iron shoes upon the ground, it throws off its old ones and stands''
''upon the new. When the horse goes, it takes the new shoes with it and leaves a pawn of Rego vis in each of the discarded shoes. The vis is tainted with the realm of faerie and Otto suspects that the horse is associated with a craftsman’s endeavors and gains something from the gift of finelycrafted new shoes. This source is considered a seisin of The Northern Seas and is protected by Tribunal law. This source costs 20 Build Points.''

==Vis Stocks==

''The covenant’s vis stocks are a combination of pawns held by each magus, two rooks of vis in a sunken ship, and extraordinary spell-like and lesser enchantment vis.''
''Alfgeir’s Resting Place''
''Twenty pawns of Dedicated Rego Aquam vis. This submerged wreck of a large Norwegian knarr would be unremarkable but for two factors. The first is that beneath the silt, barnacles, and other detritus of the sea, the hull has been carved with magical Nordic runes, and the second is that this magic has leached into the timbers and can now be collected as vis. This vis is Dedicated Vis, as per Realms of Power: Magic, page 122, to the Technique and Form of Rego and Aquam. This vis costs 6 Build Points.''
''Alfgeir’s Bones''
''Five pawns of Lesser Enchantment Corpus vis. The knarr is not all that survived. Its captain also survived after a fashion. His restless corpse, now barnacle encrusted, has the power of self-animation. At present, the thing is chained to the bulkhead deep with La Charytee’s hold.''
''The Animated Corpse ReCo 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual A season spent taming Alfgeir’s skeletal form, which can be achieved as a five-day distraction, imparts a Dexterity equal to the controller’s Intelligence and a Single Weapon Ability equal to the controller’s Finesse as the controller impresses their will upon the corpse. All other characteristics and Ability scores are considered to be zero and/or normal for a typical human. (Effect: Base 10, +2 Sun; Modifications:''
''+1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) The corpse may dutifully carry out simple instructions, but it is unknown whether this is simply the vis at work or whether there is something more insidious behind it. This vis costs 3 Build Points.''
''The Oyster King’s Shell''
''Some years ago, Hilde wrestled the shell off the Oyster King, a great beast four feet in length and nearly three feet at its widest. The two halves of the craggy shell each contain three pawns of Lesser Enchantment vis and while whole each part has the following effect.''
''The Agile Shield MuTe 14 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual This effect transforms the stone of the giant oyster shell so that it is as hard as the finest steel but as light as beaten tin. (Effect: Base 3, +2 Sun, +1 stone; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) Each half has therefore been turned into a long Norman-style kite shield. The magic in the shell reduces the weight, making the shield easy to use and incredibly strong, treating the shield as of Excellent construction and providing a +3 to Defense but with a Load of just 1. The two shields together cost 3 Build Points.''
''Fixed Arcane Connections''
''Carles has two fixed arcane connections to significant places; one to each of Boulogne and''
''Southampton. He also wears a fixed arcane connection to La Charytee in the form of a bracelet made from strands of the ship’s rigging. Finally, he has a fixed arcane connection to Hilde, which Hilde knows about and grudgingly accepts. These fixed arcane connections cost two Build Points each, for a total of 8 Build Points.''
''The Magus’ Share''
''Each magus has fifteen pawns of vis. These are nominally three pawns for each of the Hermetic Techniques, but the troupe may allow some variation in the arts. This costs three Build Points for each magus, for a total of 18 Build Points.''
''Otto-Pauels’ Share''
''Otto-Pauels has five pawns of Divine Perdo vis in the form of a small branch torn from a birch tree by an angel. This share costs 1 Build Point.''
''Dolly Price’s Share''
''Dolly Price keeps five pawns of Corpus vis in her chambers at the tavern in the event that any of the magi of the Northern Seas need it. It is not clear where the vis originally came from but each pawn has been extracted into a delicately-carved finger bone. Each bone is engraved with writhing celtic knotwork. As far as anyone has so far determined, these pieces have no intrinsic powers. This share costs 1 Build Point.''

==Wealth==

''There is little actual income generated at present, and so it is fortunate that the covenant has significant monetary stores, bought with 74 Build Points. Some of this money is in the form of treasure, some in the form of silver coin distributed among the magi, and some is lodged with the trading houses of the region. Each magus has silver and other treasure to the sum of 50 Mythic Pounds on board, with the exception of Carles and Hilde who both have 100 Mythic Pounds. A further 340 Mythic Pounds is accessible through mercantile families and societies in London, Brügge, Hambug, Lübeck, Bergen, and Riga.''

==The Covenant in Play==

''The Northern Seas has been designed as a player covenant providing independence from Tribunal oversight and the opportunity for adventure on the high seas.''

==Covenant Themes==

''The three defining covenant themes are independence, adventure, and selfdetermination. Independence: Normandy’s influence on The Northern Seas is limited. The covenant has not so far involved itself in Tribunal politics, but it is still beholden to Normandy’s Peripheral Code. A saga on The Northern Seas is about breaking those ties and finding independence on the oceans, that may also mean skirting close to the letter and the spirit of the Peripheral Code. Adventure: Andrew of Jerbiton recognizes the opportunity for adventure inherent in sailing where the wind takes the covenant. There are stories and poems to be had and reputations to be built and The Northern Seas. More importantly, these adventures have a very different flavor to those grounded on solid ground and surrounded by fairie woods and magical valleys. Self-determination: All the magi of The Northern Seas have turned their backs to some degree on what was expected of them; Columba has left the House of her training, Matilda has fled the attentions of the Stonehenge Tribunal, and Tibor Milos must determine his relationship with his lycanthropy. A Northern Seas saga is one in which these young magi help each other to achieve their aims and in that the covenant is designed to combine freedom with collaboration. The Northern Seas is also a Spring covenant, which means that there is work to be done finding and claiming resources, building alliances, and protecting the covenant from challenge and danger.''

==Player Character Roles==

''The four younger magi are suitable for use as player characters while Carles and Hilde are best used as storyguide characters, either to provide the impetus for ad''

[|

==Story Seed: The Oyster Prince==

''The long-lost son of the Oyster King returns to the sea to take up his kingdom. His first decree is that those who murdered and robbed his most noble father should be found and made to pay for their crimes. When the creatures of the sea themselves turn against the covenant of the Northern Seas the magi must either go to war with an implacable foe or persuade Hilde to give up her hard-won trophies. Even then, is that enough for the Oyster Prince?''

|]
''venture and story or as resources that the players may call upon to help confront certain challenges. Individual magi fulfill different roles. Matilda Page is a very much the quartermaster and is the maga to go to in order to develop the magical tools they need, including offensive capabilities. Columba provides a route into Order politics, partly because of her understanding of the Code and partly because of her notoriety. Andrew has the potential to be a great generalist, able to provide strong support to other magi, companions, and grogs in the party. Tibor Milos has the potential to protect and control using his strong Rego and spells concerning demons, spirits, and beasts. As a werewolf, he also provides an interesting combat option. The grogs are important as they provide the muscle that the magi individually lack.''
''Dealing with the Elder Magi''
''Setting up a covenant with two slightly elder magi NPC characters can sometimes present a challenge to storytelling as the younger magi may seek advice or help rather too readily from their elders. For the Northern Seas, however, this is less of a problem. Carles suffers from a magic addiction, as per the Flaw, and as such is reluctant to cast magic of his own when there are perfectly capable junior magi able to cast their own spells. It is also part of Carles’ plan to make the junior magi more independent of him; he wants them to outgrow him in preparation for the day they leave and found''
''their own ocean-going covenants. Hilde is prepared to help, but tends to do as directed rather than pro-actively solving problems. She is also generally unwilling to leave Carles for extended periods, especially if the suggested task is going to take her ashore. As for dominating council sessions, Carles only does so through holding the casting vote and that only through age. He abides by council decisions and while he may privately work on a backup plan in cases where he loses the argument, he also works as directed to uphold the council’s decision.''
''It is also possible that Carles and Hilde may decide to sail separately from their juniors for a season or two, perhaps hunting down a newly-discovered magical sea creature, or charting a new aura. The junior magi are left to determine the covenant’s course, deal with events as they arise, and hopefully grow as leaders and magi out of the experience. This very much places the player characters in charge of the covenant; they have elders they can turn to for advice, but elders for whom it is not in their interests to mollycoddle their juniors.''

[|

==Covenant Finances==

''The covenant, at present, costs more to run than the income it generates. It has an income of just 40 Mythic Pounds per year, thanks to the Poverty Hook, but is currently spending 133 Mythic Pounds across the same period. The largest cost by far is for provisions. It is assumed that much of the covenant’s food is caught at sea, hence the sizable reduction, but that still leaves the requirement to take on provisions when in port. The expenditure in Mythic Pounds breaks down as follows:''
''Expenditure   Subtotal  Reduction  Total Buildings   15   –7.5   7.5 Consumables  30   –6   24 Laboratories   11.5   0   11.5 Provisions   75   –24   51 Tithes   0   0   0 Wages   30   0   30 Weapons and Armor  3   0   3 Writing Materials  6   0   6 Total         133''
''The cost of the weapons and armor includes all in use by the current grogs, companions, sailors, and their captains. There are no weapons in storage. The covenant has enough money in its stores, both on board each ship and banked with mercantile families, to sustain it for the next four or five years, but it is in desperate need of increasing its income and finding further ways to reduce its costs. More on covenant wealth can be found in Covenants, chapter five.''

==Loyalty==

''The Northern Seas has no particular loyalty problem at present. The covenfolk are wary of the magi and may question their actions in hushed tones below decks, but they know that their own fates, for now, are tied to the success of the covenant. Using the rules on age 36 of Covenants, we get a base loyalty of –30, based on the Gift of the member magi, and a bonus of +2 for having been established a year already. The provision of ship’s captains is treated as a turb captain and a flat bonus of +5 has been applied. Despite the ocean being considered a Healthy Feature Boon, it does not provide a Living Conditions modifier, just a bonus to the roll, so we can’t take advantage of that here. This gives a total of –23 loyalty points, which buys a Loyalty Score of –2.''
''Base Loyalty    –30 Modifier Covenant Age  +2 Turb Captain   +5 Living Conditions   0 Austerity    0 Total    –23''
''Furthermore, this is simply the prevailing loyalty. Discipline on board ship needs to be carefully handled if the magi do not want to further alienate their crews. In order to reverse this trend, the covenant could employ a turb captain, steward and a chamberlain, all of whom help to improve the prevailing loyalty.''

|]

==Through The Aegis Suggested Storylines==

''As the covenant is erratically mobile, it is more likely to find the trouble than the other way around. This can be a boon to storytelling as the freedom that the magi enjoy means that some might sail away from the fleet for a season or two, allowing stories to be told concerning just the interested characters. Ranging from stories of exploration, distant lands, and the struggle to survive on the open oceans, there are a number of storylines that can easily run throughout your Northern Seas saga.''
''Adventure''
''Play in the Northern Seas for tales of long-lost magical devices, ancient manuscripts, and monsters from the deep. The covenant is young and in need of resources and, given that they can go almost anywhere, they are free to follow up rumors of strange magic, forgotten magi, and creatures causing trouble. The covenant’s magi and grogs are particularly well-suited to an adventurous life; even the more academic Columba has enough sense of adventure to make her home at sea.''
''Exploration''
''The cold northern seas are ancient and unchanging, qualities that describe the most powerful of Magical beings and the islands found there may be home to just such creatures. While the lands of the East are known, at least as far as the Holy Lands, the oceans to the west represent uncharted territory. Frisland and Icaria: The islands of Frisland and Icaria can be found in the waters north of Britain and to the south of Iceland. Stories of these islands persist in the tales told by sailors. Powerful magic guards these islands and their exact location is hard to determine, leading some to suspect that they are actually a manifestation of either the Magic or Faerie Realms. Magi of the Order may be interested in these islands for two reasons. Firstly, they may represent new and untouched magical resources. Secondly, and conversely, the islands may at last reveal the secretive Order of Odin, perhaps as they prepare for war with the Order of Hermes. But the truth of the islands may be somewhere in between. There may be old Viking''
''colonies on the islands, cut off from the rest of the world by the frozen mists that surround them. But are the wyrms and serpents that slumber in the ice their masters or their guardians? And what is true of one island may be the antithesis of the other. Rupes Nigra: The island of Rupes Nigra is a vast black rock over 30 miles across that sits in the middle of a great ocean surrounding the north pole. The entire island is magnetic, which explains why compasses all point toward it. Sailing that far north, travelers encounter biting unnatural weather, ancient spirits of storms and cold, and dread creatures never before seen by man. But the island could offer huge wealth, both in material and in magical terms, untouched and ancient as it is. Even the existence of Rupes Nigra is not widely known, and player characters may become the first to explore it. But finding the island is an adventure in itself as no safe passage has so far been charted. Estotiland: Sailing west by the northern seas, a thousand miles off the coast of Frisland, the island of Estotiland can be found. This vast unexplored land is populated by people who once called Mythic Europe home. They live in great cities ruled by kings which they fund and furnish through trade with Europe, made possible by their mastery of the seas. But the merchants sent out from Estotiland keep their origins secret for fear of their cities being discovered and their lands becoming subject to new crusades by Frankish nobles. The language of Estotiland is unusual and different from the Norse, the British, and those on the continent. In particular they have little knowledge of Latin and seem suspiciously unable to learn it, despite the libraries of secret knowledge found in their palaces, though Estotiland merchants know a little of the Scandinavian tongues. They are tolerant of and hospitable to visitors, but those reaching the shores of Estotiland may find themselves confined to gilded cages, forbidden ever to leave. Drogeo: Also in the west but many miles south of Estotiland is the island of Drogeo. Unlike Estotiland’s insidious dangers, Drogeo is a place of raw Infernal evil and it may even be a manifestation of hell itself. The people in the north of the island are warlike and have little but evil in their hearts. They do not farm or tend the land but take from it what they want. They do not rear herds of livestock but mercilessly hunt the unending forests, killing not for want of''
''food but for sport, often leaving the carcasses where they fall. They have no knowledge of the Artes Liberales or of Philosophiae or Medicine or of any learning that might sustain a people. They dress in animal skins and hunt with bows and spears tipped with flints. Nor do they have knowledge of God, giving praise to a series of deities, all likely to be demons feasting on the misplaced adulation of a morally corrupted and savage people. The people of the south offer a more pleasing aspect, given that they have knowledge of learned pursuits and live in walled cities, protected from the savages of the north. They also have knowledge of Mythic Europe, learning brought on the winds commanded by powerful sorcerers, and even possess books and other artifacts brought by sailors when their ships wrecked against the island. But the veneer of civilization is thin as the people of the south are cannibals and unwary crews or those unfortunate to run aground may face an end worse than death itself. The Purple Islands: The Ancient Magic supplement devotes a chapter to the Purple Islands lost amid uncharted waters. The gardens of the Hesperides can be found on the island of Junonia and it is there that explorers can find the zero point for the system of Ptolemaic Coordinates. See Ancient Magic, chapter seven for more detail. South of the Sun: The cosmology discussed in Art & Academe (page 27) suggests the tantalizing prospect of the Magic Realm being physically manifest south of Africa beyond the great ocean that separates the north from the south. But it is not just a vast ocean that explorers must contend with but the searing impassable heat caused by the proximity of the Sun to the Earth at the equator. Hermetic magic may be unable to protect magus, ship, or crew against the heat of the Sun, perhaps because of the encroachment of the lunar sphere. Alternatively, perhaps this is precisely the place where magi of the Order can study the lunar sphere with ambitions of achieving a famous Hermetic breakthrough. Whatever the case, navigating to and surviving within this most torrid place is nothing short of miraculous.''
''Lost and Drowned Cities''
''Beyond islands, there are stories of sunken and drowned cities in almost every ocean, some cities, such as Atlantis, accumulating so many stories that no one can be sure where''
''they are, how they might be reached, or what might be found. Atlantis: To those schooled in classical texts, the most famous lost city is Atlantis. Said to have once been home to the Gods of the Greek pantheon, the city fell into ruin when the children of the gods and mankind took their utopia for granted and greed and lust befell them. The gods sank the city in a great flood in punishment for their sins. Atlantis may still exist, surrounded by regiones, either still on the surface of the sea or far beneath the waves. There may be wizards schooled in ancient Greek magic seeking for a way to release their people, calls for help that may make their way to magi exploring the oceans of Mythic Europe. But have the people of Atlantis given up their lustful, greedy, and envious ways? Have the centuries mellowed them or will ancient Atlantean weapons forged by Hephaestus be turned against Mythic Europe? Tartessos: The lost city of Tartessos is a tragic kingdom ruled by a heartbroken king. Once a proud and powerful trading nation that sent ships to all corners of the known world, Tartessos sank into the sea at the mouth of the Guadalquivir river near the city of Cadiz in the Iberian Tribunal. See Legends of Hermes for more information on Tartessos.''
''A New Tribunal''
''Carles wants to found a new Tribunal. This covenant is the first step toward that aim, but there will be many more. He needs to bring his new covenant on board with his plan, something he has already done with Hilde and Columba. He needs to research the Code further to look for clauses or rulings of which he is not yet aware. And he needs to persuade others to his plans, against much opposition. His current plan involves assisting in the foundation of three other ocean-going covenants; one in Stonehenge, one in Hibernia, and another in either the Rhine or Loch Leglean. This should provide at least twelve magi across four separate covenants, which is considered the legal minimum required to found a Tribunal. This is going to take time and resources. Other magi need to be persuaded as to the benefits of founding an ocean-going covenant, and getting them started may require the purchase of ships, the hiring of crews, and a great deal of support. Even once this is done, there is no guarantee that these young covenants will embrace Carles’ aims and the politics are going to be difficult.''
''If you are following the Lotharingian Tribunal saga seed presented in The Lion & The Lilly, then both sides of this debate may seek to secure the support of the Northern Seas for their own political devices, irrespective of Carles’ own future aims. There may be opportunities in this for those prepared to play the long game.''
''The Involvement of House Tremere''
''Tibor Milos has a duty to report back on the activities of the Northern Seas and his parens at least may try to disrupt the covenant’s aims. This provocation may escalate if House Tremere considers any actions taken against one of their members to be an insult to the House.''
''The Loss of a Founder''
''Carles is the wind in the covenant’s sails, so what happens when Carles disappears? Do the magi look to the shark-tempered Hilde for guidance or do they take control of the covenant’s destiny? And what then do they do with it? Or do they go looking for Carles and attempt to rescue him from whatever far off land or realm he is lost within?''
''The Voice of Sin''
''The demon in the fleet will not show himself easily; he is too cowardly for that. This gives him time to possess the crew, use their voice to call for piracy, theft, violence, and cruelty. How long before the character of the covenant becomes corrupted and the magi turn from scholars to pirates?''
''The Cold Northern Seas''
''The Order of Hermes are not the only wizards on the seas. Rune Wizards, Trollsynir, and Muspulli may be found in the cold north on both land and at sea. These wizards might have alliances with all manner of great serpents of the deep to control the icy waters of the north, and this would prevent the covenant from fully exploiting northern resources as they would like. Can accommodations be made or must the covenant go to war with these magical traditions and their powerful allies?''
''The Unfriendly Waters''
''More can be made of the other covenants of the region and beyond that operate at sea. Rivalries can escalate and it might take but one misunderstanding to start a feud with Waddenzee, or make political enemies of Oculus Septentrionalis.''
''Longevity and the Like''
''With few resources to call upon, it does not take long for the covenant to feel their lack of magical power take hold. Carles and Hilde find it difficult to recreate their longevity rituals, which comes as a warning to the younger magi. The covenant must decide whether it is to become truly self-sufficient and find a way to provide for themselves, or it must find allies prepared to help them in areas where they cannot yet help themselves.''
''The Hermetic Tourney''
''As with any covenant of the Normandy Tribunal, the Northern Seas is expected to take part in the tourney; the magical competition with both resources and pride at stake that takes place at the conclusion of each Tribunal gathering. As a young covenant, Carles is under no illusion about their prospects, but he would like the covenant to win at least one event, if only for one year, before the covenant breaks away to found its own Tribunal. The covenant’s grogs seem rather keen to take on the melee, and the covenant may look to Tibor to take on the certamen tournament.''

==The Northern Seas as an NPC Covenant==

''The magi of the Northern Seas can fulfill many roles in existing sagas, from allies to adversaries, suppliers to customers, and perhaps even more.''
''Allies''
''Those who provide support to the Northern Seas could stand to benefit. There are several reasons to do this, of course. If Carles succeeds in having the oceans deemed fit territories for new Tribunals then the wealth of the oceans is ripe for exploitation for those who arrive early. In supporting Carles now, his knowledge and support later''
''would be invaluable. Also, the covenant of the Northern Seas is nominally in the Normandy Tribunal. Lip service paid to Carles’ aims potentially secures six votes at that Tribunal. Your saga can easily realign the covenant’s Tribunal membership to the Rhine, Provencal, Stonehenge, or Hibernia to better fit your own magi. The principle remains the same. Magi who have been disadvantaged by the actions of pirates, sea monsters, or other sea-going magi might wish to engage the Northern Seas for assistance.''
''Adversaries''
''The magi of the Northern Seas are not above piracy and this could, wittingly or unwittingly, push them into conflict with other magi. Unless a ship flies a recognizable Hermetic flag, its cargo could be at risk. Unless that cargo is in some way magical, charges of depriving a magus of his power usually do not succeed against such piracy. Other magi have already reached a similar conclusion to Carles and they too attempt to exploit the seas. The covenant of Waddenzee in the Rhine are pirates and sagas based in Waddenzee, or a similar covenant, are likely to clash with the covenant of the Northern Seas from time to time. Quaesitor or politically-oriented characters may be tasked with investigating the covenant to discover firstly whether the magi are guilty of any Hermetic crimes and secondly whether Carles and his scheme poses any danger to the Hermetic status quo. The magi of the Northern Seas are likely to be resistant to attempts to pry into their affairs and motives, at least until they can address things on their own terms. If they trust their inquisitors, they may invite them to travel with them for a season or''
''more, and during that time they may expound on the possibilities of the sea. Inquisitors may find themselves drawn to the charismatic Carles and persuaded by Columba’s detached logic.''
''Suppliers''
''The ocean is home to strange beasts and foreign plants, soils, salts, and stones that many magi might never had read of let alone seen or handled. Imagine a magus in the deepest forests of the Rhine presented with the ink harvested from a magical squid. What strange undiscovered properties, all new to Hermetic understanding, might that magus research? A whole new world of objects of Virtue, extraordinary vis, and shape and material bonuses are opened up and covenants like the Northern Seas are instrumental in this.''
''Customers''
''For all their freedom, the magi of the Northern Seas do not carry everything they need with them and nor can they provide every service that they might need. The ships housing the covenant may require repair from time to time, as well as replacement supplies, and potentially new build work. A Hermetic Shipwright (Hermetic Projects, chapter 4) would do well to seek out the Northern Seas as they could be a valuable customer, given the six ships currently in the fleet and the potential for expansion. The covenant would willingly trade vis for enchantments, both discrete and to entire ships, and the covenant could keep a Hermetic Shipwright busy for many years. Hermetic Architects (The Mysteries: Revised Edition, page 97) might see the covenant as a particular challenge; could they create rituals that give particular structures discrete''
''magic auras? How could such auras be sustained? The Northern Seas may be willing to fund such original research, given that success would open up the oceans of the known world to magi of the Order. As the covenant grows, the magi may acquire properties ashore, perhaps even in magic auras, that they might need others to watch over for them. Spring covenants may benefit from this arrangement as they gain use of Northern Seas properties, while making them available to the magi when needed. Vis sources might also be treated in the same way, with magi collecting vis on behalf of the Northern Seas and taking a share in return. Alternatively, The magi of the Northern Seas may not invest directly in land, but might instead pay a stipend for the use of facilities, resulting in frequent visits.''
''Filial Relationships''
''The magi of the Northern Seas are predominantly young, barely out of apprenticeship in some cases. This means that those characters could be used as or replaced by the filii of your saga’s magi. This gives your existing covenant a link to the Northern Seas, with perhaps obligations to support individual magi along with opportunities to be brought into their unique stories. Player apprentice characters may decide, like Columba, to run away to sea, swept away with the romance and adventure of it all. The Northern Seas would make a good backdrop to stories of these apprentices discovering more about themselves in an environment that contrasts with the more formal and more usual covenant that they came from. In such stories, the other troupe players could easily pick up and play the magi of the Northern Seas.''
