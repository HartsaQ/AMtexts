''The mundane animals of Mythic Africa are distinct from those of Mythic Europe. This appendix provides information and game statistics for them.''

==Camel (Jamal)==

''Camels are well adapted to arid environments. They can ﬁnd water by smell: open water sources have the same distinct smell as the air after rain. Camels can survive without water for extended periods, and are able to travel in mild sandstorms without harm. Their hooves have a unique design that splays when they travel on loose-packed surfaces, like sand, so that they do not sink into it as deeply as a human or hoofed animal does. This allows them to travel more swiftly on sand than horses, and to be less fatigued by running on sand than other animals are. Dromedary camels were first presented in the description of Alexander of Jerbiton in Magi of Hermes, pages 10– 11. The following statistics represent a common riding dromedary.''

Add Fast Runner (+3 to all rolls involving running) and Improved Characteristics to increase Quickness to +0. War camel: Add the Aggressive and Pack Animal Qualities and the Ferocity (when ridden in battle) Virtue. Increase Brawl (hooves) to 5. A war camel’s kick has the following basic combat statistics: Init +0 Attack +8 Defense +5 Damage +2. It can be trained to attack as part of a Trained Group with its rider. Bactrian camel: These two-humped eastern camels gain the Hardy Quality and the Long-Winded Virtue but also possess the Feral Scent Flaw. Bactrian Camels are fully detailed in the “Ship of the Desert” insert in The Cradle and the Crescent, page 170,''
''together with several additional variants bred for particular roles.''
''The rare white Camels of Virtue are considered masters of the sands and wander from desert to desert leading tribes of wild camels using their ability to access a great Desert Regio Network that bridges the desolate dry landscapes they call home.''

==Dog, Painted (Kalb)==

''Much more social than the smaller jackal of the northern desert, this wild canine often hunts in packs of similar gender of up to 30 animals. Often found near the desert strongholds of the Tuareg, preying on the pastoralists’ herds of goats, sheep or camels, a pack is capable of pursuing and killing gazelles and other antelopes on the open plains. For its size it has one of the most powerful bites of any dog, reﬂected by increased damage from the Crushing Jaws Quality. Its habit of disemboweling prey lends it a negative reputation as a bloodthirsty killer.''

''All painted dogs are fast runners and gain +3 on all rolls involving running, being able to pursue prey for long periods over considerable distances if necessary. A Bjornaer magus with a Painted Dog Heartbeast would have a choleric humor with a melancholic aspect.''

==Fox (Tha’lab)==

''The fox is a symbol of guile and cunning in both Mythic Europe and Mythic Africa, featuring prominently in folklore. The tales of Reynard the Fox fooling the kingly lion, the foolish sheep or the greedy wolf are particularly common in France but local variations are heard particularly throughout Christian lands. In Arabic speaking lands the fox presented in stories similar to those of Reynard the fox is referred to as either Abu Hassan or Abu Suleiman. The African fox is smaller than its European cousins, but no less sly.''

''The tiny (Size –5) creature weighing about 3 pounds known to the Bedouin as a fanak (Fennec) is found throughout Mythic Africa and the Mythic Middle East. Larger Arabian variants (Size–-3) of the sand fox with more reddish coloration can be found only in ‘Uman in southern Arabia – their Wound Penalties are adjusted accordingly but their combat statistics are otherwise identical. More cunning mundane versions of foxes exist: add Crafty x2 (increase to Cun +3) and add Guile 3 (animals). Magic aligned versions such as Vafer the Magical Fox and Felix the Lucky Fox were ﬁrst presented in Tales of Mythic Europe, page 14 and Magi of Hermes, page 123 respectively. A Fox of Virtue is also presented in Realms of Power: Magic, page 67. Faerie and Infernal foxes have also been encountered by Hermetic magi and sahir. All foxes are excellent jumpers and get a +3 to all rolls involving jumping. Bjornaer magi with fox Heartbeasts are considered to have a choleric humor with a sanguine aspect.''

==Goat (Maa’ez)==

''Goats are common in Mythic Europe and beyond – they are used for their meat, their milk and in some places their hairy hides. Transhumance, the movement of pastoralists and their herds from the coastal plains to the mountain pastures over the course of the year, is particularly common in Provence and the Maghreb. Many Christian tales of the Devil depict Satan as a black goat or humanoid he-goat presiding over a coven of witches, and folklore is full of tales of local hedge magicians assuming the form of goats. Popular moralising associates the goat with lechery due to their extreme activity when in rut.''

==Goat (Capra)==

''Characteristics: Cun –1, Per +1, Pre –4, Com –5, Str 0, Sta +1, Dex +2, Qik +1 Size: –1 Virtues and Flaws: Long-Winded, Perfect Balance; Lecherous (Minor).

Appearance: The statistics above reflect a small wild she-goat (Arabic: ‘anaza) such as an Arabian tahr. Both male and female goats have short knobbly horns, although males of many breeds possess larger natural weapons Male goats (hircus) are similar to the basic she-goat above but some may be larger (Size 0, increasing Strength to +2 and dropping Quickness to 0), have a stronger Personality Trait of Lustful +3 and have the Ferocity (romantic rival) Virtue. Larger breeds of goats, goat-antelopes and sheep (up to Size +1) such as the Mouﬂon, and breeds with larger horns such as the Ibex of the Levant or the Barbary Sheep of Morocco exist throughout Mythic Europe and Mythic Africa — these creatures may have increased strength due to their larger size or have their combat statistics altered using the template for Large horns: Init +2, Atk +3, Def +2, Dam +3. Sheep: These statistics can also be used for wild ewes (ovis). Change Per''
''sonality Traits to Peaceful +3 and Obedient +3, drop the Aggressive and Extra Natural Weapons Qualities, decrease Cunning by 1, and change Abilities to Brawl (dodge) 2. Not all wild ewes have horns and most are smaller than goats (Size –2): subtract 2 from Strength and increase Quickness to +2. Wild rams (aries) resemble male goats but have the following different Personality Traits: Virile +3, Violent +2. Domesticated goats and sheep lack a Survival score but have slightly higher Communication scores of –4. All goats and sheep are good climbers and gain a +3 bonus to all rolls involving climbing. Bjornaer magi with wild goat Heartbeasts have a melancholic humor whereas those with wild sheep Heartbeasts are melancholic with a choleric aspect.''

==Hyena (Dhubba)==

''In the thirteenth century hyenas, or dhubba, are found throughout the Levant, North Africa, Iraq, Persia, and lands beyond. These striped hyenas can be trained and tamed like dogs, even to the extent of becoming part of a dog pack if raised with hounds. Although not sacred to the ancient Egyptians, hyenas were used in hunting desert game. Some greater African specimens (Size +1) may be signiﬁcantly larger than the standard sized versions detailed here and their Middle Eastern cousins (also Size –1). These fell beasts are often ridden by jinn or witches. The hyena is also a common animal form for ghul to assume.''

Natural Weapons: The weapon statistics for a hyena’s bite are Init 0, Atk +4, Def +1, Dam +3. The damage bonus is increased to +6 as noted due to the Crushing Jaws Quality (see later). Appearance: The more common striped hyena has a comparatively massive torso with shortened hind legs, causing its back to slope down. Their short muzzles are borne by a large head and long thick immobile neck.''
''NEW QUALITY''
''Crushing Jaws: This quality reﬂects the fact that although the animal is not particularly strong compared to humans, the muscles with which it bites down are tremendously powerful. The muscles that open its mouth are comparatively weak. A human may hold closed the animal’s jaws with a successful Grapple. This Quality adds +3 Damage to any bite attack.''
''HYENA OF VIRTUE (CROCOTTA)''
''The Hyena of Virtue, known as the crocotta or kynolykos (Greek: “dog-wolf”), hails from Ethiopia and is believed to be the product of a hyena and a lion. These spotted hyenas are larger (at least Size +1), appear to shift genders readily (as per the Gender Shift Virtue), and are comparatively much stronger and faster (Strength +4, Quickness +3, and Tough Hide Quality) than their mun''
''dane cousins. Add the Improved Characteristics Virtue, the Tough Virtue and the Tainted by Evil Flaw. They are also both more violent (add the Aggressive Quality and increase their Brawl score to 5) and less cowardly (replace Cowardly with a Fierce +3 Personality Trait). Unlike their lesser cousins, the crocotta has real Intelligence (Int +2) and a laughing human-like cackle with improved powers of mimicry (equivalent to speaking Arabic 3) that they use to trick human prey. All crocotta possess the Greater Immunity: Steel Virtue and many have the ability to enthrall their victims as per the Entrancement Ability. Some crocotta can strike dogs dumb if their shadow falls across them and can paralyze any creature they look at thrice. A stone found in the body of a Hyena of Virtue can serve as a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm (Ward Against Faeries of the Desert) or alternatively grant the ability to see the future (Premonitions or Visions). In some cultures it is the eyes of the crocotta that grant similar powers. A charm made from the genitalia and anus grants the Venus’s Blessing Virtue to the wearer according to Persian sources.''

==Jackal (Wawi)==

''Unlike the wolf, the jackal, or ibn ‘awa (wawi), is not a pack animal and usually hunts alone or in mated pairs, or scavenges near the edges of human settlements. It is more friendly to man than its cousin the wolf and can be domesticated and even trained to act as a guardian, but not for hunting. Black jackals are also considered symbols of Anubis, the ancient pagan Egyptian god of embalming and the dead. The black jackal is also a common shape assumed by both Faerie and Infernal jinn, particularly by ghul or members of the Ghul tribe, probably due the animal’s scavenging tendencies and habit of lurking near cemeteries.''

Appearance: Smaller than a wolf with shorter legs, the jackal is slighter in build with a longer body and a shorter tail. Predominantly reddish-yellow in color, some individuals have black highlights or even grey fur.''
''All jackals are fast runners and gain +3 on all rolls involving running, able to pursue prey for long periods over considerable distances if necessary.''
''A TYPHONIC BEAST''
''Found in the easternmost deserts and Egypt is the jackal-like creature is known as the Set Animal, sha or sal’awa. Sporting the body of a jackal, the ears of a donkey, a long curved snout and an upright forked tail, it has a distinctive appearance. It is associated with the dark Egyptian god Set, equated with the Greek monster Typhon, and is said to be a harbinger of misfortune. Such an unusual animal is almost certainly magical and may make a unique familiar if a magus can locate and be''
''friend such an elusive creature, although its allegiance to an elder being aligned with destruction may give fainthearted magi pause. Alternatively, the sha may be dark Faerie hounds, the monstrous form of a shapeshifting hedge magician, or even an Infernal beast that seeks to trap an unwary magus into serving its long forgotten dark master.''

==Lizard (Waral)==

''Tuareg myths consider these desert lizards to be ancestors of the current tribes and harming, killing, or eating a waral or waran is considered taboo. Found throughout the desert sheltering in the rock clefts or basking in the sun on ﬂat stone outcrops, these reptiles have a sinister reputation among the other desert peoples.''

If the waral’s advantage is higher, the victim suffers effects equivalent to an exceptionally debilitating poison (Stamina roll against Ease Factor 12, Incapacitating), regardless of whether the bite inflicts an actual wound. Unlike smaller venomous creatures such as the adder, a waral’s special attack is not hindered by high leather boots or other simple measures and it can use the venom to great effect on a victim it has already grappled with its locking bite. Appearance: These large grey lizards can become aggressive when provoked, lashing their tails when aroused. Their size and color varies depending on their habitat, with some specimens growing over 8 feet long, like the one detailed here. Although slow in gait, the creature’s powerful jaws can snap closed quickly to lock around its prey and prevent escape.''

==Ostrich (Na’aam)==

''Scattered throughout northern Africa but more commonly found in Egypt, a slightly smaller version of this ﬂightless bird ranges throughout northern Arabia and the Levant. Valued for their feathers, leather, and less so for their meat, they roam the semi-arid plains in great ﬂocks but avoid the deep desert. Ostrich hunting remains a favorite pastime of nobles and rich sahir.''

Males are typically black with white tail plumage, whereas females are a more discreet grey color.''
''Larger versions of these birds are kept by some evil jinn to use instead of horses or to trade with nobles and sahir who favor a more exotic mount to impress the common folk. Such specimens are typically Size +2 or larger and may have additional Virtues such as Great (or Mythic) Quickness, Perfect Balance and Unaffected by the Gift. Some jnun tribes have bred their Faerie ﬂocks to have magical powers dealing with travel and distance. Unlike other birds, an ostrich cannot ﬂy or even glide but can run as fast as a gazelle if needed. Similar to horses, an ostrich gets a +3 to all rolls involving running.''

==Scorpion, Monstrous (al ‘Aqrab)==

''Known as al ‘Aqrab in Arabic speaking lands, the scorpion is a common shape assumed by evil jinn. The creature presented below represents a type of “giant” black scorpion about the size''
''of a small rabbit found in the Arabian deserts. The majority of scorpions encountered are Size –8 or smaller, but swarms of hundreds or thousands are treated as a single much larger creature (see later).''

==Scorpion, Monstrous (Scorpio)==

''Characteristics: Cun –2, Per –2, Pre –5, Com –6, Str –10, Sta +2, Dex +2, Qik +6 Size: –5 Conﬁdence Score: 0 Virtues and Flaws: Lightning Reﬂexes; Infamous Qualities: Aggressive, Ambush Predator, Extra Natural Weapons, Grapple, Tough Hide, Venomous Personality Traits: Fierce +3 Reputations: Deadly (local) 5 Combat: Pincers: Init +6, Attack +10, Defense +14, Damage -6 Grapple: Init +6, Attack +7, Defense +11, Damage n/a Sting: Init +10, Attack +10, Defense +6, Damage –9* Soak: +4 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1), –3 (2), –5 (3),Incapacitated (4), Dead (5+) Abilities: Athletics 3 (running), Awareness 3 (food), Brawl 5 (sting), Hunt 4 (rodents), Stealth 4 (ambush), Survival 3 (desert).

A normal scorpion’s special attack is hindered by high leather boots or other simple measures just''
''like the bite of an adder or asp. Appearance: A black creature with over-sized pincers and an arched barbed tail.''
''These statistics represent over-sized versions of the common scorpion – most scorpions are Size –8 or smaller. Although black scorpions appear more menacing and aggressive to the unwary, in general the lighter colored scorpions are more dangerous as they possess more potent venom (at least Ease Factor 12, Fatal) and can blend into the desert sands (add the Camouﬂage Quality, drop the Aggressive Quality, and decrease to Brawl 3 with resultant change in combat statistics). The potency of scorpion venom varies according to the exact creature. Different poisons can range from inﬂicting a Medium wound to being Fatal and even the venom of smaller specimens can have much higher Ease Factors (up to 15). Even larger scorpions can be found deep in the deserts – comparatively gigantic specimens (Size +3 or greater) are rumored to lair in the Egyptian deserts guarding old tombs and sand-choked ruins. Stories tell of Mesopotamian scorpion-men with wings or hybrid scorpionhuman centaur-like creatures that guard the temples of old gods and of winged scorpions in Egypt and far India.''
''OPTIONAL RULES: SWARMS''
''Rules for swarms of small creatures such as black beetles (Size –15) or normal sized scorpions (Size –9 or –10) were ﬁrst presented in Legends of Hermes, page 44 and may be particularly useful for wizards or jinn capable of controlling large numbers of tiny creatures through the use of the Command Animals or Summon Animals Virtues, an innate Magical power, or equivalent Hermetic magic. An evil jinni that takes the form of a swarm of smaller creatures such as beetles, scorpions or rats would be thematically appropriate. The venom of normal-sized scorpions is painful, but individual stings are rarely fatal for healthy people. In Africa, where scorpions are common, the allergy that causes their sting to be fatal may be taken as a Minor Flaw. An attacking swarm of scorpions does +10''
''damage automatically each round, but this can be Soaked normally.''

==Unicorn, Eastern (Karkadann)==

''...it has the build of a buffalo...a black, scaly skin; a dewlap hanging down under the chin. It has three yellow hooves on each foot... The tail is not long. The eyes lie low, farther down the cheek than is the case with all other animals. On the top of the nose there is a single horn which is bent upwards... al-Biruni (11th century polymath) describing a unicorn''
''Compared to the romantic image of its western counterpart in Mythic Europe, the karkadann or “Lord of the Desert” is a large and overtly aggressive beast. Found in the Persian deserts or the plains of North Africa, the monoceros is famed for attacking elephants by charging at their bellies and is often depicted skewering them on a long horn that arises from its forehead. It can be soothed by the ministrations of a virgin, but its horn is not an antidote against poisons like the alicorn of its western cousin.''

Although the karkadann is protected by its thick skin as if it had a shell, it is otherwise slower than an average animal of its size and suffers a –3 penalty to all rolls involving fast or nimble movement, including attacking opponents in melee but not including charging into battle. Larger specimens (Size +5) and Faerie versions are found in the southern plains and foothills at the edges of the desert. Similar creatures are rumored to roam the plains of Ethiopia, where the fabled Eastern Unicorn of Virtue is said to dwell. Monstrous jinn with the head of a karkadann are mentioned in folklore as guardians of entrances to Jinnistan or as shock troops in the jinni armies that served Suleiman and Balquis, the Queen of Sheba. The karkadann is too large to be taken as a Heartbeast for a Bjornaer unless the magus has the Giant Blood Virtue and the Troupe decides on a suitable background to explain their unusual ancestry.''

==Between Sand & Sea Vulture (Nasr)==

''The Egyptian Vulture commonly found throughout the Levant, the Mythic Middle East and North Africa is sometimes referred to as “the Pharaoh’s Chicken” due to its frequent depiction in Egyptian royal carvings. In ancient times the vulture was associated with the goddesses Isis, Mut, and Nekhbet, and was considered the symbol of the Kingdom of Upper Egypt with her wings spreading out to protect the pharaoh.''

Appearance: A large ugly raptor with a bright orange face and white plumage with black tipped wings, often soiled with blood and carrion. Its head is bald, preventing its features from being stained when eating.''
''Larger vultures, up to Size –1, are found across Mythic Africa. Although slower, these raptors are much more aggressive (add the Aggressive Quality — add 1 to Cunning and increase Brawl (talons) to 5) and have been known to attack ﬂamingoes and other smaller creatures instead of just scavenging. Vultures are highly intelligent and the more capable ones have been known to use rocks as tools to break open eggs in nests. They can also drop stones on their prey — Greek mythology claims that the poet Aeschylus was killed when a stone was dropped on him by a bird mistaking his bald head for a tortoise. Vultures that dwell in remote mountain crags often nest within Magic auras and become Warped from repeated exposure to magical energies. These creatures are readily distinguished by their brilliant and varied colored plumages. Some of these magical vultures are capable of limited divination with a particular emphasis on death. These avian seers have the equivalent of the Premonitions Minor Supernatural Virtue or the Visions Minor Supernatural Flaw. More accomplished and older female vultures can possess the Divination Major Supernatural Virtue (see The Mysteries: Revised Edition, pages 58–62) and have a relevant Ability score of Divination 4 (death). They receive a bonus to Ceremonial Augury of +3 for misfortune and a bonus of +5 for augury questions involving death. These birds are a common form for shapeshifted ghul or Infer''
''nal hedge wizards. Bjornaer with a vulture Heartbeast have a sanguine temperament with a choleric aspect. They are almost always female. According to Pliny, vultures have a keen sense of smell, able to detect carrion from across the sea and add +3 to rolls involving smell and a +2 to all Hunt rolls.''
''VULTURE OF VIRTUE''
''These giant black creatures dwell in the highest mountains. Vultures of Virtue personify intimidation, patience and prudence. All examples identiﬁed by hermetic magi to date have been female, and most are believed to live for a hundred years. Many classical authorities deny the existence of male vultures, claiming that vulture females reproduce by parthogenesis, giving birth to a daughter identical to their mother, an allegory the Church uses to prove that Virgin birth is a naturally occurring phenomenon. The skin of their bald heads contains Corpus rather than Animal vis. At least one elder Bjornaer maga with a vulture Heartbeast has passed into Final Twilight in recent memory, transforming into a Vulture of Virtue. It is unknown what would happen if a male Bjornaer with a vulture Heartbeast passed into Final Twilight.''
