''Covenfolk surround a covenant’s magi, supporting them and aiding them. For the storyguide they are bit-parts and extras who fill out the saga, and provide roles in play for players whose magus or companion is elsewhere. They provide players with variety and a chance to explore alternative roles from their main characters; they also provide opportunities for low humor and soap opera.''
''The covenfolk best-knownto most magi are the familiar shield grogs who accompany and defend them in the heat of battle, providing the brief calm needed to cast spells. There are many more covenfolk than just these, however; indeed, covenfolk fill all the other places in a covenant. This chapter discusses their roles and provides grog templates for many, also discussing spelland magicbased substitutes for some roles.''
''The rules allow covenants to purchase specialists with Build Points, but these are blanks-with-Abilities, lacking even character sheets. They cost Build Points because they allow the players to sketch the covenant without effort. Characters created as grogs or companions, however, need not be paid for with Build Points. This chapter encourages you to flesh out the covenant with real characters — companions and grogs — rather than simply purchasing specialists with Build Points, and it includes character templates as examples for customization.''
''This approach is best-suited to the slow saga speed (two or more game sessions per season) and medium saga speed (one to four seasons per session), where the lifespans of magi extend beyond the scope of the saga and individual grogs can be expected to survive for all or most of it. But even in fast sagas (one or more years per session), grogs are still worth creating and playing even as they age and die. Indeed, their mortality and succession may be a theme of the saga. As a practical matter, however, in such sagas some roles''
''are likely to be filled with paid-for specialists without character sheets.''

==Troupe Styles and Covenfolk==

''Covenfolk characters fit neatly into both the Alternative Characters and Pooled Characters styles of troupe roleplaying described on ArM5, page 219.''
''The Alternative Characters section talks specifically about the possibilities of having multiple companions per player, or even multiple magi, so long as they have good reason not to go on adventures together. However, the Alternative Characters style works particularly well if the additional characters are grogs rather than companions: there is less pressure to keep playing the additional characters if it’s inconvenient, and as support characters, they have built-in reasons to accompany other characters in whatever they are doing.''
''It is quite reasonable for a player to design and play as many supporting covenfolk characters as he wishes to spend time creating — they will appear in play as and when needed. Indeed, certain covenfolk may appear more often in play than some magi. Where stories are tailored to, and focus on, one magus at a time, the same covenfolk may be employed in support of all of them.''
''Ars Magica Fifth Edition describes Pooled Characters as a separate style, but in truth, if you employ covenfolk as Additional Characters, then the two styles of play blur and overlap. A grog designed as an additional character by one player may drift into a pooled role if other players take him on when his owner is playing her magus or companion. Alternately, a''
''grog designed as a pooled character may wind up being played most often by one particular player, who may eventually adopt him as her own. Characters may shift back and forth between the two states in an extended saga.''
''In all of this, covenfolk, when created and played as grogs, enjoy all of the advantages described in ArM5, allowing risk taking and ham-acting, and allowing the storyguide to emphasize death and other serious events without overly disturbing the great investment players make in their magus characters.''
''The character advancement rules make it particularly easy to maintain and update covenfolk: even if you forget to advance them regularly, it is easy to apply several years experience in one go, to “catch up” with game time.''

==Saga Settings and their Covenfolk==

''Saga styles vary, from the gritty realism of low fantasy to the everyday dealings with dragons and demons that characterize high fantasy. Likewise, sagas might emphasize mundane interactions or hermetic life, investigation of mysteries or political intrigue. The types of covenfolk relevant to each style quite obviously vary, though there remain some universally germane types as well. In addition to a saga’s style, the scale of the troupe’s covenant also has an impact on the types of covenfolk relevant to it.''
''The sections that follow each provide a handful of templates relevant to a particular sample style or scope of''
''play, including an isolated tower, a manor and farm, a grand castle, and a magical environment. These templates may, of course, be mix-and-matched as the troupe desires.''

==An Isolated Tower==

''The sample covenfolk in this section make their home in a physically small covenant at some remove from its mundane neighbors.''

''all she seems — while an attentive and effective servant in a magus’s chambers, she is also a perceptive spy, reporting back to another magus in the covenant. Small Frame can be swapped for Obese (Size 0) if you re-figure her Wound Penalties. Keen Hearing, Light Touch, and Puissant Awareness are good alternatives to Keen Vision. This character can be used as a maid without being a spy — perhaps by replacing Dutybound with another Flaw such as Continence or Temperate, or changing the area of her Weakness — but her two Personality Flaws should not overlap. Abilities can be swapped freely, so long as 50 XP are left in Artes Liberales and Latin.''

==The Sample Characters==

''The sample characters in this chapter are intended for use as grog templates, extending the set on ArM5, pages 21–22. Like those, these can and should be tweaked and customized when using them in a saga.''
''Grogs should have no Major Virtues or Flaws, no more than three Minor Flaws balanced by an equal number of Minor Virtues, and no Story Flaws. Most characters should not have more than one Minor Personality Flaw, lest they move from entertaining to irritating, but grogs may often be an exception. A grog with two very different Minor Personality Flaws may become an instantly recognizable feature character of a saga.''
''Since these templates reflect characters living close to or within a covenant, many have some level of Covenant Lore to reflect their knowledge of what goes on “up where the magi live,” as well as some quantity of Village Lore to describe what they know about things “down in the village.”''

|]

==A Manor and Farm==

''These covenfolk inhabit a larger covenant enmeshed — to a greater or lesser extent — in the mundane politics of the immediate region.''
''Other manor-based characters might include an ale-wife, charcoal-burner, or weaver (all based on the Craftsman template); swine-herds or farmers (based on the Peasant), or a steward or reeve (based on either the Lord of the Manor or — for a skilled non-fighter — on the Lady).''

==Grog Creation as an Introduction to Ars Magica==

''The process of designing grogs provides an excellent introduction to Ars Magica character generation for those not familiar with the game, who have not yet mastered the intricacies of the system. Players creating grogs benefit from an encouragement to experiment, to try out ideas, and to “push the envelope” a bit. This allows them to get their feet wet before they spend the effort to design a full magus, and prevents them from feeling committed to a magus character  with obvious failings arising from misunderstandings about the game system. Grogs are both simpler and more “disposable,” allowing one to feel safe in making mistakes.''
''Covenfolk also provide the storyguide with a sideline in walk-on roles, especially in sagas where there is only one alpha storyguide running adventures, with no full-time character in the saga.''

Making clear glass by magic is an expensive alternative, requiring Creo rituals (and vis); Perdo cannot be used to remove “just” the impurities, as it is in the nature of Perdo to make things more flawed than the ideal. Only Creo can move matter towards an ideal. This glass-blower’s Craft skill can be changed freely, and the Offensive and Oversensitive Flaws easily changed.

==Making Covenfolk Interesting==

''Some covenfolk serve immediate and obvious roles in the covenant  but rarely find places in stories. The covenant may need to have a baker, for example, but why would a baker be interesting to play? And why, for that matter, would the troupe even want an interesting baker?''
''The second question should be answered first, because its answer is simple and obvious: Interesting characters, no matter their station, make for interesting stories. The answer to the first question — what might make lowly covenfolk interesting to play? — is a bit more difficult, but not overly so. There are a number of good strategies.''
''First, such characters sometimes have unexpected talents — either Abilities or Virtues — that play either for or against their type. A baker with Puissant Craft: Baking might be the toast of the covenant for his masterworks, while one with Arthritis might make poorly kneaded bread that no one wants to eat. Both options suggest many stories. Visitors''
''who’ve heard of the former baker’s pastries might come from far and wide to taste for themselves, while a crotchety magus might get literally fed up with the latter’s dense loaves and demand that the aged — but perhaps well-liked among the other covenfolk — baker be replaced.''
''Covenfolk might also have entertaining Virtues, Flaws, or Personality Traits unrelated to their profession. Characters who complain ceaselessly about even rosy situations, see profit in even the most marginal enterprises, or always have just the right piece of romantic advice can become saga fixtures whose presence in stories is demanded by players. When these characters draw more from magi, companions and other grogs — more personality, more story possibilities, more roleplaying — they truly live up to their potential and give the saga life it would lack without their presence.''
''Some covenfolk find recurring roles simply because their skills are useful, or the storyguide finds them useful to introduce adventure seeds. While the core rules emphasize the Story Flaws of the magi and companions, and discourage grogs from having Story Flaws, it may still turn out to be humble grogs who provide the lever needed to prize reluctant magi out of their laboratories by stumbling across trouble. Virtues or non-Story Flaws can even provide story seeds; Faerie Blood or Second Sight may lead to faerie encounters, for example.''
''Covenfolk can also develop relationships to characters outside the covenant, and these also provide natural links to stories. What’s even better is that these links often arise naturally from the ongoing nature and long duration of a saga. Grogs who have taken part in adventures may become inextricably entwined with the circumstances and events of the story as it unfolded.''
''Note that even oft-overlooked specialist characters purchased with Build Points can be brought into the limelight when particular stories would clearly involve them. It may be necessary to improvise an anonymous scribe’s personality — or even his name! — the first time this happens for a particular specialist. As the saga progresses, however, full statistics should be considered for the specialists who have made in-game appearances. That way they can return in the future, fleshed out in three dimensions, and add verisimilitude to your saga.''
''The templates that follow provide two examples of covenfolk who can serve as entertaining player characters, veritable founts of story material, or both.''

==Magical Alternatives to Covenfolk==

''The natural assumption when sketching out a medieval community is to allo''
''cate people to perform the work that is needed, whether they be grogs or specialists. However, this is not always convenient or possible. The most obvious constraint is the space available within the covenant. A single tower can only accommodate a limited number of folk, especially when the largest chambers are occupied by magi and their laboratories''
''(and their benches, glassware, and such), leaving perhaps only one common room for the others. Some such towers may have ancillary buildings for grogs, or a nearby village that can house covenfolk, but other covenants cannot even manage that much extra space. A flying boat, for example, has only the space within its own confines, and no more is possible.''

''Rego magic can make any change a mundane craftsman can effect, even when the magus is limited by lack of tools, time, or skill. However, Rego cannot create matter, so whatever is in the final product must be supplied as source material: to turn iron into steel a magus needs both iron and carbon; to dye cloth or leather she must have a supply of dye. Materials that a craftsman would use  and then remove from the product, are not needed for craft magic. For example, magic can bleach skins to make parchment without the lye that a percamenarius must use.''
''Rego craft magic works by rearranging existing material, and requires a Finesse roll to control this rearrangement. (Creo magic draws on the realm of Forms to produce things, which are always at least roughly right.) As a baseline, this has an Ease Factor at least 3 higher than the Ease Factor for doing the same thing by normal craft. Failure means that the spell produces a mess rather than a useful item; a botch means that the failure is overlooked (that is, the object is seemingly normal) but will let the user down treacherously, usually when he least expects it. For example, a botched woven cloth might not unravel until a garment made from it is worn in public; a botched parchment might accept the ink, but flake it off when left undisturbed.''
''Factors which might increase the Ease Factor of the Finesse roll include drastic shortening of time. While a day’s work in an instant is “just normal magic,” a month’s or longer effort would increase the Ease Factor by +3 for a month’s work, +6 for a season’s work, or +9 for a year’s work. If the mundane craft would use many temporary substances to process the work, consider adding +3 or more to the Ease Factor.''
''Rego craft as rearrangement of materials means that some functions of the mundane craftsman are outside the province of craft magic. For instance, a butcher can kill an animal with a knife, but craft magic cannot do this, as lifeinto-death is not a rearrangement but a destruction (which falls in the realm of Perdo magic). (Non-craft Rego could, however,, with enough Finesse, wield a knife to similar effect.) Similarly, a skilled craftsman can examine and interpret an object’s manufacture and guess at its history or function, but this is not rearrangement of materials either, it is Intellego magic.''
''Extending the duration of a Rego craft spell makes the spell perform the same action over and over on the same starting materials — it is almost always inappropriate.''

''Whatever the reasons magi might find it difficult to attract or house covenfolk, however, magic gives them  options for getting work done that are not available to common, mundane communities.''
''Spells can perform a task in a trice: Rego magic can make any change which a mundane craftsman can perform, even when the magus is limited by lack of tools, time, or skill. But while spells can be an instant solution, they are not always perfect. Spontaneous magic is limited in its results, while formulaic magic requires that some magus spend time to invent the spell formula (either from a Lab Text, or worse, from scratch). Spells also require a magus to cast them, which distracts the magus from study or lab-work whenever the spell is needed — and requires that the magus be present at the covenant, not away enjoying an adventure. Rego craft magic furthermore depends on the Finesse''
''of the casting magus, another study burden, and the Finesse required for a given task may be higher than the available magi are prepared to work up to.''
''Magical enchanted devices can reproduce many of the effects of spells, including all of the regular housekeeping spells. Further, devices enable non-magi to trigger their effects, so the covenant’s masters may stay in their chambers while a small number of grogs work with wands. Magical devices do, however, require an investment of time and raw vis to create, though duplicate devices may be created much more quickly than unique ones using the original’s Lab Text. Devices may have environmental or Intellego triggers, but generally require living grogs to wield and direct them. Devices may also be tricky to use: if the magic requires a Finesse roll to produce high-quality work, covenfolk without specialty training in''
''arcane Finesse will fail to put such devices to good use, which  probably rules out most Rego-based craft magic in devices.''
''Magical automata may provide selfdirected and active service. Creating such devices is beyond the scope of this book, although some may remain as artifacts from past archimagi or others.''
''Alternatively, entire portions of the covenant might be enchanted as devices, replacing the staff and taking over their functions The covenant may not have a gate with guards, for example, but a huge spell-driven mechanism with fearsome automata, or the whole gate concept may be reorganized and entrance effected by combined magical-transport and remote sensing devices.''
''Replacing servants with magic has additional benefits: a magical oven is much more compact than a baker, especially as it has no family. What’s more, it does not get hung-over on the weekend. That said, the story-potential of a hung-over baker is rather higher than that of a perfectly repeating magical device. Ars Magica devices from the standard rules are not normally fickle and temperamental.''
''People also have an advantage over spells and devices when it comes to flexibility. Spells and devices are quite rigid in performing the tasks built into them, and do not easily adapt to changing circumstances. Grogs, on the other hand, can both follow orders and also think for themselves, reacting to unforeseen events.''

==Spells==

''A few spells and new spell level guidelines follow, describing just a few work-saving options commonly employed by magi of the Order of Hermes. There are additional crafting spells in Chapter 7: Library, for example, to turn hide into parchment.''

===New Guidelines===

''Creo Animal Guidelines Level 2:	 Preserve a corpse from decay.''
''Rego Animal Guidelines Level 1:	 Manipulate items made of ani''
''mal products. Level 2:	 Treat items made of animal''
''products. Level 3:	 Treat and process items made of''
''animal products.''
''For greater complexity add one or two magnitudes. (Increased complexity usually also increases the Ease Factor of the mundane craft, and so increases the Finesse roll Ease Factor.)''
''Creo Herbam Guidelines Level 2:	 Preserve a dead plant from''
''decay.''
''Rego Herbam Guidelines Level 3:	 Manipulate items made of plant''
''products. Level 4:	 Treat items made of plant prod''
''ucts. Level 5:	 Treat and process items made of''
''plant products. For greater complexity add one or two magnitudes (e.g., Base 15 might be used to weave thread into a tunic).''
''Rego Terram Guidelines Level 2:	 Shape and form dirt, as if a''
''craftsman had worked it. Add one magnitude for stone or glass, two for metal of gemstones. Add one or two magnitudes according to complexity.''

===New Spells===


===a Spell To Milk Cattle===

''ReAn 15 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group While you wait, the cows are magically milked without further handling, transferring their milk into nearby milkpails. The magus’s Perception + Finesse roll substitutes for an Animal Handling roll by a competent farmer; the spell gathers the milk, but if the roll is failed, the cattle may be spooked.''
''Milking cattle is normally Simple (3) if the cattle are accustomed to the process and the milking hand, so the basic Finesse Ease Factor is at least 6, higher if anything disturbs the cows. Cows are initially be disconcerted at being milked by invisible hands, and need soothing (The Gentle Herd is ideal for this task). Unless magically calmed, the Finesse roll is Very Hard (15+) the first time cows are milked by magic, but this Ease Factor reducing over time and successful milking to 12, then 9, until the cows become accustomed to the process (6).''
''(Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group)''

===The Gentle Herd===

''ReAn 20 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group A group of animals are rendered calm and placid, even while unusual events''
''occur, such as invisible hands milking them.''
''(Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group)''

===The Carpenter’s Keen Eye===

''InHe 15 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group The magus learns whether wood is suitable for use in carpentry, with an indication of the treatment needed (e.g. “unseasoned — season it”, or “old, brittle, and dry — discard it”).''
''(Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 Group)''

===a Spell To Kill Weeds===

''PeHe 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group The magus touches a weed, and it and all similar plants within a 15-pace range — up to 10 cubic paces of plant material — are weeded out.''
''(Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group)''

===The Mystical Carpenter===

''ReHe 25 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group The magus selects a pile of wood, and the spell cuts, splits, carves, and joins the wood into the desired form. Any nails needed must be supplied, but wooden dowels can be formed from the supplied wood.''
''The magus must make a Perception + Finesse roll to determine the success of the process, substituting for a Craft: Carpenter roll, and if this fails, the results is just a mess of chopped-up wood. The Ease Factor is at least 3 higher than a carpenter’s Craft roll would require, so the simplest basic items have an Ease Factor of 6, increasing as the task gets harder.''
''If the magus chooses inappropriate wood (such as green, unseasoned wood), the spell still acts — as if an unwilling carpenter worked against his better judgment — but the resulting goods will undoubtedly split and warp later. The magus’s choice of wood can be improved by The Carpenter’s Keen Eye, or the advice of a real carpenter.''
''(Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 flexibility)''

===The Invisible Glass-worker===

''ReTe 4 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The magus may transform a piece of glass into a finished form, as if a glassworker had shaped and formed it. The magus must succeed with a Perception + Finesse roll substituting for Craft: Glassworker against an Ease Factor at least 3 higher than the mundane Ease Factor. Failure reduces the glass to a slumped''
''lump as if an incompetent beginner had worked on it.''
''Note that in the thirteenth century, most glass is not particularly clear — making clear glass is an alchemical process, beyond a craft-spell. Glass often has bubbles and distortions unless a real expert works on it, with a proportionately high Ease Factor.''
''(Base 2, +1 Glass, +1 Touch)''

===The Spell of Wrought Iron===

''ReTe 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group The spell transforms raw pig-iron from a furnace into plain bars of wrought iron, as if a blacksmith had worked the iron in his forge. The magus must succeed in a Perception + Finesse roll to work the bars and separate out the slag. The task is normally Easy (6) for a blacksmith, so the base Ease Factor is 9. Failure means the iron and inclusions do not separate; a botch means that the inclusions go unnoticed, and the iron will be flawed and crack under strain.''
''(Base 2, +2 Metal, +1 Touch, +2 Group)''

===The Phantom Blacksmith===

''ReTe 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group The magus transforms iron bars (or other ready iron) into a crafted and formed result, as if a blacksmith had worked to the magus’s instructions. The magus must succeed in a Perception + Finesse roll substituting for the smith’s Craft: Blacksmith roll, with +3 to any Ease Factor. Failure means that the device also fails to function; a botch means it has hidden flaws.''
''(Base 2, +2 Metal, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 flexibility)''

==Lesser Enchanted Devices==

''The following sections describe a number of enchanted devices that may be used around a covenant to make short work of mundane labors.''

==Magical Oven==

''Creo Ignem 20 Pen +0, 24/day R: Pers, D: Conc, T: Ind, device maintains concentration''
''The device takes the form of a hollow box of iron encased in fire-brick, with a detachable iron lid. On command, the hollow interior becomes red-hot and stays so until sunset or the command to stop is given.''
''If this amount of heat is excessive, as it often is, food may be placed on the oven’s lid, or on a grid above the brick.''
''(GL 5, +1 Conc, +5 levels to maintain concentration, +5 levels for 24 uses)''

==The Enchanted Chef==

''Rego Herbam (Animal, Aquam, Ignem) 45*''
''Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group Placing a selection of food (vegetables, meat, liquids) inside this pot and closing it, the user describes the recipe they wish applied to the food, which is instantly processed and transformed as if by a cook. The edibility and quality of the food is not changed in any way, other than to discard small spoiled parts (as any cook would).''
''The resulting dish is as described by the user, and limited by his knowledge (or imagination) and quality of description. A Communication + Finesse roll by the user replaces the Craft: Cook roll (at +3 Ease Factor). The food will be at least technically edible (if edible materials were placed within), though a poor Finesse roll may result in a less appetizing dish than hoped for. The user may substitute Communication + Craft: Cook for Communication + Finesse if he possesses that skill.''
''Covenants lacking grogs with the desired skills may write out instructions for the device, provided the grogs are literate enough to read a recipe. Use the writer’s quality (as if he were writing a tractatus) in place of die rolls. Failing all else, the user can request “Traveler’s Hot-Pot.” This is a very basic stew, with peeled vegetables and chopped meat, boiled until over-done, which has an Ease Factor of only 3.''
''(GL 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +3 for requisites, +1 flexibility, +5 levels for 24 uses)''
''(* Because of its high level, many covenants must create this device as an Invested Device.)''

==Stone-Cutting Knife==

''Rego Terram 15 Pen +0, unlimited uses R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part''
''This enchanted chisel shapes and forms stone as if a well-equipped stonemason were carving it. The device may be used to carve blocks from a quarry (hence the Part Target). The wielder’s Dexterity + Finesse roll substitutes for a mason’s Craft roll (with +3 to the comparable Ease Factor).''
''It is a Simple task for a Mason to cut a plain block, so the basic Finesse Ease Factor to use this device to cut blocks for building is 6. Grogs deputed to the task can usually be trusted to carve blocks of approximately regular shape, though they may need trimming to fit, when used.''
''(GL 2, +1 stone, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +10 levels unlimited uses)''

==The Enchanted Porter==

''Rego Terram 15 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind, device maintains concentration''
''This enchanted glove, when placed against an inanimate object, lifts and pushes the object as the user holds on and moves. When the user removes his gloved hand from the object, it settles to the ground.''
''(GL 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +5 levels to maintain, +5 levels for 24 uses; based on The Unseen Porter)''

==The Motivated Plow==

''Rego Terram 15 Pen +0, 24/day T: Touch, D: Conc, T: Part, device maintains concentration''
''This lightweight, plow-shaped device can easily be pushed along even by a single grog, not needing any harnessed beasts. If settled on the ground, it transforms even hard-packed earth into loose, well-plowed soil in a circle 15 paces across.''
''(GL 2, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +1 Part, +5 levels to maintain, +5 for 24 uses; based on The Forgiving Earth)''

==The Vitalizer of Provisions==

''Creo Animal (Herbam) 19 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group This chest preserves food placed within it, preventing decay while the door''
''remains closed. When removed from the box, the effect ceases to affect the food, and it may be cooked and eaten — as fresh as when it was placed within.''
''(GL 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +3 levels environmental trigger, +1 level for twice daily)''

==The Death of Vermin==

''Rego Animal 20 Pen +0, 1/day This box is enchanted to fill specific vermin with a desire to approach and enter the box. The box is placed where vermin are found, triggered, and left to gather any that approach the box. The effect lasts until sunset or sunrise: most vermin are either active by day, or active by night, so one use gathers all vermin in that area.''
''Once in the box, the vermin may be destroyed by a suitably equipped grog.''
''(GL 2, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group) A spell exists to kill pests instantly, but is level 50 Perdo Animal, and a device to perform this task would require 5 or 6 pawns of vis; as such, it is cheaper to have a grog sit by and stomp on the vermin necessary.''

==Abluere Magica==

''Rego Herbam (Animal) 15 Pen +0, unlimited uses T: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The device takes to form of two hinged boards that close together in the manner of a large book. Placing a soiled garment between the boards momentarily renders it clean and fresh, as if a washerwoman had worked her art upon it.''
''The user must succeed with a Dexterity + Finesse roll substituting for Profession: Washer-woman, although the clothes will at least be clean and fresh (though creased) even if the user is incompetent; if the user botches, they will be subtly soiled, to be discovered later.''
''Some covenants enchant a larger device, requiring two people to open and close it, which cleans bedding too.''
''(GL 4, +1 Touch, +10 levels for unlimited uses)''

==The Dumb Waiter==

''Rego Terram, level 35 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group''
''The Dumb Waiter instantly transports food and plates, drink and cups, from the kitchen (where the device resides) to specified places in the covenant within 50 paces. The destination for a given load is indicated by placing a small arcane connection in a receptacle on top of the device.''
''The Dumb Waiter ensures that food is as fresh as possible, and still hot, when it reaches the high table; it also ensures that the food is not dropped on the way, nor scraped back onto the plate and delivered anyway.''
''(GL 15 by analogy with ReCo guidelines, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +5 levels for 24 uses)''

==Incendior Homines==

''Creo Ignem 30 Pen +8, 50/day R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind This aid for the militant turb provides heavy firepower, exceeding that of the long bow, and can be used even by an unskilled grog. When the trigger is activated, a designated target is enveloped in flame, suffering +15 damage, with +8 Penetration. The downside is that targets with Magic Resistance may shrug off the device.''
''The device takes different forms according to the whim of the magus making it. The wand is traditional, but a ring or brooch is also common; one magus made a small toy gargoyle that spat a jet of fire when squeezed.''
''(GL 10, +2 Voice, +6 levels for 50 uses, +4 levels for +8 Penetration).''
''A level 40 variant offers powerful covenants a fiery blast with +28 Penetration for only one more pawn of vis.''

==Fantastical Covenfolk==

''So far this chapter has discussed human (or mostly human) characters. In a magical environment such as an Ars Magica covenant, however, people are quite likely to encounter more outlandish creatures such as talking beasts even when the saga is not high fantasy. These exotic beings can take the roles some kinds of covenfolk, sometimes remarkably well: a talking dog could effectively serve as a''
''scout or hunter, for example, combining the dog’s scent and hearing with the intelligence and competence of a grog. On a more intimate level for magi, the humble laboratory assistant might take the form of a Barbary ape or similarly dexterous creature.''
''In a more fantastical saga, you may not be restricted to “natural” dogs — those that run around on four legs — but find upright hounds specializing in etiquette and haute-cuisine, transformed to a greater or lesser degree.''
''Included in this heading are the familiars of magi. Most sagas will have familiars, even if only accompanying senior non-player magi. These creatures have human intelligence, magical powers, and links to their “owning” magi, which together make them just as fantastical as some of the other entries listed here. Indeed, you can use familiars as the inspiration for whole classes of enchantedbeast covenfolk.''

''Hound is one of those unusual magical creatures who can be found in Mythic Europe — an intelligent, beast-shaped creature, with Magic Might and magical powers. He has been recruited as a covenfolk character in return for such as he values: plenty of food, warmth and comfort, and to be praised for his faithful service. He has learnt some new skills since joining the covenant, primarily Area Lore and begging-by-cuteness.   The Virtuous Hound is based on the bloodhound in The Book of Mundane Beasts, with species Virtues of Long-Winded and Sharp Ears, and a species Flaw of Reckless. Other breeds or species can be substituted for the bloodhound.''

==Beasts as Characters==

''A number of beasts of Mythic Europe are described in The Book of Mundane Beasts, a free download from the Atlas Games website. The hound and cat (and the skinchanger’s raven form) are based on that supplement. Each species of beast has certain Virtues and Flaws common to all members of the species, which are not balanced in game terms (as the normal balance reflects costs for humans), but rather indicate the unique strengths and weaknesses of beasts. Exceptional beasts may take individual Virtues and Flaws, on top of their species types, but these must balance as normal.''
''Normal Beasts cannot learn new Abilities unless Trained, but can improve existing Abilities; intelligent beasts can improve as normal. Beasts usually have a number of Abilities, which represent what members of their species can perform instinctually, rather than things they have learned. (Beasts are usually “too young” to have learned anything by the normal process of character generation.)''

She has gained 4 years experience since joining her master as a young (1 year old) cat. Changing this familiar’s type is straightforward using The Book of Mundane Beasts.   Bond effects are the choice of the magus; these are but a sample of a familiar that grogs may encounter. (Bond scores are not included here.)''

==Thematic Covenfolk==

''In addition to serving and providing the economic base of the covenant, it is possible for grogs to define a secondary theme for the covenant. For example, the covenant may have resident ghosts in a high Magic aura, or the magi may magically bind the spirits of deceased grogs as wardens. The magi may be involved in Hermetic politics and employ spies, thieves (“burglars”), and political agents; or they may have a religious or academic affiliation and employ (or at least provide residence for) scholars, scribes, or clergy. A covenant with strong links to a faerie forest would be well advised to acquire at least some covenfolk with faerie gifts or faerie blood; indeed, magi with a practical bent and an eye for the future may set out to breed such grogs.''
''For added personality, a covenant which makes extensive use of enchanted devices to aid, enhance, or replace grogs may have had most of the devices manufactured by a single magus (stereotypically a Verditius magus, but quite possibly''
