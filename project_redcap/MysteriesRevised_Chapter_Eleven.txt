''From the time of Pythagoras onward, the magic of numbers has fascinated men. In this chapter are uncovered the secrets of Hermetic Arithmetic, the magical application by Hermetic scholars of the principles of Euclid that comprise Hermetic Geometry, and the potent marvels of Hermetic Architecture, that allow great magical structures to be erected. In the 13th century, there is a fascination with magic number squares, and the influence of Jewish numerological systems like gematria led to a number of gentile variants. However, the outstanding breakthroughs in this area in this century were not Hermetic, but rather in the work of architects who, using only simple, non-magical tools, created the great gothic cathedrals, masterpieces of the Dominion.''
''Numbers fascinate many magi, and insights into the mystery of numbers lead to Divination (Numerology). Numbers also form the basic of many puzzles, codes and ciphers — these are not Mysteries, just mysterious to those without the key!''
''Artes Liberales (arithmetic), often abbreviated to Arithmetic, is a key Ability for magical Numerology; Artes Liberales (geometry) for Geometry and Architecture.''

==Hermetic Numerology — Minor Mystery Virtue==

''In Numerology, the magus sees correspondences between the number and form of elements in all things, even those seemingly unconnected. These correspondences are governed by the magus’s''
''understanding of Arithmetic — that is, Artes Liberales (arithmetic).''
''Hermetic Numerology permits the magus to devise small spell-like formulae called Rotes, and to enchant a Numerologist’s Book to gain a book bonus. Rotes are mental exercises, are cast without a die roll, and benefit as if the magus had the Mastery special abilities of Quiet Casting and Still Casting. The Numerologist’s book bonus adds to Numerology and to Hermetic Geometry and Hermetic Architecture.''
''Hermetic Numerology is also a prerequisite Virtue for Divination (Numerology) (see Chapter 7: Divination and Augury).''

===The Numerologist’s Book===

''The Numerologist derives great meaning from the patterns of words and letters in texts. To achieve this takes a great deal of study, and there are many interpretations promoted by hedge magic traditions (for example, Gematria in Realms of Power: The Divine). There are many ways in which Hermetic magi seek to incorporate texts into their magic.''
''The Numerologist should choose a great work as the basis of her study: many magi choose either the Bible or Bonisagus’ De Theoria Magica (the Authority on Magic Theory). To aid her magic, the Numerologist may enchant her book and attune it to Numerological magic, and gain a book bonus.''
''As detailed below, the magus may create either a lesser Numerologist’s Book with a book bonus of +4, or a greater Numerologist’s Book with a double book bonus of +8. The book bonus is limited''
''by the magus’s score in Artes Liberales (arithmetic).''

===Lesser Numerologist’s Book Opened===


===With 8 Pawns of Vis===


===Lesser Book Bonus Is +4===


===Greater Numerologist’s Book Opened===


===With 16 Pawns of Vis===


===Greater Book Bonus Is +8===

''Consulting the Numerologist’s Book provides a bonus to Numerological activities:''
''If the magus performs Divination (Numerology) (see Chapter 7: Divination and Augury), and consulted as part of the Ceremonial Divination, the magus adds the book bonus as a ceremonial bonus. If the book is consulted while working in the Laboratory, the book bonus can be added to Lab Totals for Numerology, including Rotes, and to Lab Totals for Hermetic Geometry and Hermetic Architecture. If the book is consulted before invoking a Rote (taking an extra round to look in the book), the book bonus is added to the Rote Casting Score.''
''The bonus is based on the numerological principle of insight in numbers — that opening the book, seemingly at random, and inspecting the relationships between words on the open pages provides a connection to numbers (and objects) in the environment. The magical attunement of the Numerologist’s Book helps the magus to quickly open the book''

''to significant pages, almost as if the book opens itself for him.''
''Many Numerologists also attune the book as their talisman. (As a talisman, the book can be reopened for enchantment, which allows the magus to improve a Lesser Book to a Greater Book.)''
''Consulting the book advises and assists the magus, provided that the Numerologist consults its pages for insight throughout the activity (Rote-casting or laboratory work). Consulting the book when casting Rotes takes an extra round of casting time to select and examine''
''pages of the book, and the magus must carry the book with him. The magus may create more than one enchanted book, but only benefits from one consulting book at a time.''
''The Numerologist’s Book may also be invested with normal enchanted effects. In this case the Shape and Material Bonuses for enchantment apply separately from the Numerological bonuses, and can be combined if appropriate.''
''If the magus knows Hermetic Divination (Numerology), it is possible to also invest the Numerologist’s Book''
''with Enchantment of the Scrying Device. The Numerologist performing Ceremonial Divination then gets both a Ceremonial bonus and a Magical bonus; see Chapter 7: Divination and Augury — Ceremonial Divination).''

===Rotes===

''By studying arithmetic and preparing formulae that are memorized “by rote,” the maga may invent small spells called Rotes.''
''Rotes are similar in action to the non-Fatiguing Spontaneous casting of spells (where the Casting Total = Casting Score/5), and no die roll is made to invoke Rotes. Rotes are more powerful than nonFatiguing Spontaneous Magic (Casting Total = Casting Score/2) but limited to similar levels (Lab Total/5).''
''As an arithmetic formula, a Rote is largely a mental exercise and benefits as though the maga had the Mastery special abilities of Quiet Casting and Still Casting for the Rote. As this is a numerological activity, the maga gains a book bonus if she has a Numerologist’s Book to consult before invoking a Rote.''
''In addition to any book bonus, the maga gains a bonus to her Rote Lab Total equal to Artes Liberales (arithmetic), limited by Magic Theory.''

''A normal medieval book has wooden boards making up the covers (in turn, usually covered in leather), and parchment or vellum (leather) pages. An average medieval book is “large” sized for enchantment (about the size of a shield). To open just the parchment or just the wooden covers takes 8 pawns of vis (and requires a Magic Theory of 4). It is also possible to open the whole book as a compound device, including both the wooden boards of the cover and the parchment pages, requiring 16 pawns of vis (and a Magic Theory of 8).''
''Both methods of opening provide the “book” Shape Bonus; opening the parchment provides a Material Bonus for parchment (also leather or animal hide), while opening the cover boards provides a Material Bonus for wood.''
''(It is also possible to include gems and metal binding, to make a particularly large compound device, if the magus can handle the vis requirements.) (See also Chapter 10: The Great Talisman, for more ways to improve a device attuned as a talisman).''

===New Shape and Material Bonuses:===

''If investing Numerological effects into a lesser or greater Numerologist’s Book, the magus may benefit from both the Shape and Material Bonus, and from the special Numerologist’s book bonus.''

==Magical Books==

''If a magus knows Hermetic Numerology, and opens his chosen text as an enchanted book, then he may attune it as a Numerologist’s Book at the same time as opening it. The process of attunement is relatively short and simple, and adds just a seven-day distraction to the laboratory work. Only the magus who opened and attuned the book may gain the book bonus. The book bonus is limited by the magus’s score in Artes Liberales (arithmetic).''
''The lesser Numerologist’s Book is created by opening the parchment''
''pages: it takes 8 pawns to open the parchment for enchantment (and requires a Magic Theory of 4). The lesser Numerologist’s Book provides a +4 book bonus.''
''The greater Numerologist’s Book is created by opening the whole book as a compound device, including the wooden boards of the cover, requiring 16 pawns of vis (and a Magic Theory of 8); see ArM5, page 97. The greater Numerologist’s Book provides a doubled book bonus of +8.''

''Penetration is calculated as for any other spell:''

===Penetration Total = Casting Total – Spell Level + Penetration Bonus===

''If the Casting Total equals or exceeds the level of the Rote, then the Rote is invoked. Otherwise there is no effect.''
''Rotes are invented by the usual spell design process of accumulating (Lab Total – spell level) points to exceed spell level. Given the low level of Rotes, this is more easily expressed as inventing a Rote if Lab Total points equal to twice Rote level are assigned. If the maga has a Lab Text for a Rote, she invents it if she assigns Lab Total points equal to Rote level. Given the low level of Rotes, the maga can expect to invent several Rotes (of the same Technique and Form) in a single season.''
''When a maga invents a Rote, she may write a Lab Text for the Rote, but only one with Hermetic Numerology can make use of it, and only as a Rote.''
''Example: Numera has a Creo Ignem Rote Lab Total of Intelligence +3 + Creo 14 + Ignem 12 + Magic Theory 6 + Arithmetic 6 + lesser book bonus 4 +Lab aura 5 = 50. She can devise Rotes with a maximum level of (50/5) = 10. She can invent two level 10 Rotes (20 points each) and a level 5 Rote (10 points). If she has Lab Texts for some Rotes, she could use as many as five level 10 Rote Lab Texts in one season (10 Lab points each from a Lab Text). She could mix inventing new Rotes with inventing Rotes from Rote Lab Texts.''
''Example: Numera has a Lab Text for a Rote to ignite flammable matter (CrIg 10, Voice, Mom, Ind: GL 4 +2 Voice), another Lab Text for a Rote to create daylight (CrIg 10, Touch, Conc, Ind: GL 4 +1 Touch, +1 Conc), and one to keep a person warm (CrIg 5, Touch, Sun, Ind: GL 2 +1 Touch, +2 Sun).''
''She wants to invent a new Rote to make an object red-hot (CrIg 10, Touch, Mom, Ind: CrIg 5 +1 Touch). This is 10 + 10 + 5 + (2x10) = 45 levels, which she can achieve in a single season.''
''Later, prowling around a church in the dark, she desires a light, and considers casting her daylight Rote: her casting Score is Stamina +1 + Creo 14 + Ignem 12 + Arithmetic 6 + aura (–3 x 4) =21. Casting Score/2 =11, which is enough to make the Rote work. She pauses to consider the size and shape of the church, the number of her companions and her''
''and their equipment, and invokes her formula: a light glows in her hand. (If she had brought her (large, heavy) book with her, she could take an extra round to look in the book and add her book bonus to her Casting Score.)''
''If she were to try Spontaneous Magic instead of Rotes, her non-Fatiguing Casting Total in the church would be (Stamina +1 + Creo 14 + Ignem 12 + aura [–3 x 4]) / 5 = 3; her Fatiguing Spontaneous spell total would be (15 + stress die) / 2, which has an average of 11, but requires her to speak in a firm voice, fatigues her, and risks four extra botch dice. Numera is glad that she prepared her Rotes.''
''It is possible to Master Rotes and benefit from other special abilities, and add the Mastery level to the Casting Score, but few magi bother. (The mental exercise benefits do not provide actual Spell Mastery levels.)''

===Numerologist’s Spells===

''Numerologists have a great interest in numbers, and like to count things. The following spells do not require Numerology: Indeed, Numerologists have been encountered trying to interest other magi in these spells.''
''Intellego spells do need to penetrate Magic Resistance, and counting spells miss out those who resist the spell. Counting magi is technically the high crime of “spying on your sodales using magic,” but no-one has yet pressed the issue.''

===Numbering the Flock===

''InAn 20 R: Per, D: Mom, T: Sight The Numerologist instantly knows the number of animals she can see, and how many of each kind.''
''The pattern of such numbers is considered to be far more significant than the details of the numbers. Numerologists often use this spell in connection with Casual Augury (Numerology) to interpret the numbers.''
''(Base 4, +4 Sight Sense)''

===The Significance of the Group===

''InCo 10 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group The Numerologist instantly divines the number of people in a group. The''
''spell allows any restriction within the parameters that define a standard Group Target; for example, “How many onelegged men are in the crowd?”''
''Numerologists claim to be able to gain insight from such numbers.''
''(Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Group)''

===Numbering the Host===

''InCo 15 R: Per, D: Mom, T: Sight The Numerologist knows the number of people he can see, and may distinguish them by appearance: men and women, old or young(-looking), and so on.''
''(Base 3, +4 Sight sense)''

==Hermetic Geometry — Minor Mystery Virtue==

''The ancients, in the form of the philosopher-wizard Euclid, recorded principles of geometry that form the fundament or base from which magi study the matter. The five postulates of particular importance are:''
''that a straight line may be drawn from any point to any other point (thus all points are linked), that a straight line may be produced to any length (and thus lines are unbounded links between points), that given any point as a center, a circle of any radius may be inscribed (and thus there is sympathy between points and circles),''

''viduals in the spell Target (a visible property determined just by looking at the target). Level 3: Count the number of indi''
''viduals in the spell Target, divided into apparent categories. Level 4: Sort the individuals in the''

''that any two right angles are equal (and being equal are connected sympathetically), that given a line and a point that is not on the line, there is exactly one line through the given point that does not intersect the first line (and thus this second line is special and connected to the first).''
''These postulates provide sympathetic magic via Geometry.''
''Calculations within this Mystery use Artes Liberales (geometry).''
''Hermetic Geometry grants the following benefits.''

===Bonus for Circles, Rings, and Lines===

''When casting any spell that involves tracing a circle or line, including standard Circle and Ring spells, and the new Line and Circle forms of Hermetic Geometry,''
''•''
''•''
''the magus gains a bonus of +3 to his Casting Score.''

===Ceremonial Figures===

''When casting any spell involving a regular geometric figure — circle or line, but also regularly formed Room and Structure targets — the magus may use Ceremonial Casting (even for Formulaic spells) and include complex Geometric and Numerological correspondences to gain a bonus of +3 to the Casting Score (cumulative with the bonus for circular or linear figures, if that applies — A room has a regular geometric form, if, for example, it has circular or rectangular (right-angled) shape; a structure is regular if its rooms are regular and are gathered into a regular form: a cathedral is regular, but most farms are not.''
''No additional time is required above the 15 minutes per magnitude of spell for Ceremonial Casting. However, the magus''
''must be able to draw and trace symbols on a cleared, smooth surface at least two paces across, and inscribe geometric shapes in accordance with the numbers. For spells up to sixth magnitude, shapes of circle (1, 2), triangle (3), square (4), pentagon (5), and hexagon (6) are inscribed, together with numbers and formulae at the points and center of the inscribed shapes.''
''For spells of higher magnitude, the magus requires additional components, one per additional magnitude. Typical components include:''
''candles incense powders (minerals, metals) sprinkled along the lines of the figure purified water sprinkled along the lines of the figure oils sprinkled along the lines of the figure''
''The magus’s player is encouraged to be inventive in preparing her list.''

===New Range and Targets===


===New Range: Line===

''Equivalent to Sight. A straight line may be produced from any point (the magus) to any other point (calculated by the magus), and may be produced to any length.''
''The advantage of Line Range is that it extends as far as Sight but does not require that the magus can see the target. However, he must be able to sense it in some other fashion: Hermetic magic cannot in general affect an unsensed target. For instance, the magus may hear someone talking on the other side of a wall.''
''To successfully target a spell at Line range, the magus must accurately calculate the location of the distant point where the spell will take effect, succeeding in an Intelligence + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor equal to the Distance Level (see insert). This is a non-magical exercise in Geometry, and requires scribing lines and circles on the ground or similar surface. This takes one whole round for each 3 points of Ease Factor or part thereof.''

''The standard Ring and Circle Targets are not particularly strict about the shape drawn: so long as it is closed and continuous, and the magus successfully traces the line while casting the spell, even rough approximations to a circle count as Circle Targets.''
''Hermetic Geometry grants bonuses (see Ceremonial Figures) for regular shapes, and the new Target Arcane Circle and Duration Arcane Ring require a perfect circle or ring.''
''A perfect shape is drawn without deviation or irregularity. This is very hard if attempted freehand, and easy if using tools. Drawing a perfect shape succeeds with a roll of''

===Drawn Freehand,===


===Die Roll + Dexterity + Profession: Scribe Vs. an Ease Factor of 6 If Drawn===


===With the Aid of Posts and String.===

''Drawing freehand, or drawing a circle using a prepared center post and string, takes no extra time over that required to trace the line for spellcasting. Placing and positioning extra posts for triangles, squares etc., typically takes at least two minutes. In any case only one Scribe roll is needed to check the quality of the line. If the Scribe roll fails, the magus knows and may choose to start again; if he is stressed and botch, he fails to notice the error until it is too late (and the spell may botch). If the magus has plenty of time and no distractions, this can be a simple die roll.''
''Magi are often tempted to cheat, scribing the shape magically (Scribe the Perfect Circle) and then simply tracing over the scribed line.''
''Spells with Circle or Ring Target require the magus to trace the shape moving no more quickly than ten paces per round, and make Intelligence + Concentration rolls of 6+ every round. Tracing the shape for spellcasting is required even if the shape is already drawn.''

''If the magus can directly see the target point, then he may cast a Line spell as if it were a Sight spell, with no calculations needed.''
''If the magus fails the roll but does not botch, then the target point is a distance away from the desired point by an amount equal to the Ease Factor multiplied by the shortfall, in a direction chosen by the storyguide, or by rolling a die. If the roll botches, then the spell cast botches too.''
''Example: Lineus knows Centrus is ten paces away, directly beyond a wall. Ten paces has a Distance Level of 1 — the Ease Factor for the calculation is therefore 9 (minimum Ease), and takes 3 rounds to calculate and scribe a design on the ground. Lineus has Intelligence 3, Artes Liberales 5, and rolls 4: he easily makes the roll. The spell''
''is cast, and accurately targets the point indicated. Unfortunately, Lineus is not as perceptive as he is clever, and is unaware that while he was calculat''
''ing Centrus crept round the wall and is about to tap him on the shoulder while Lineus stands wondering why his spell failed.''

===New Target: Arcane Circle===

''Equivalent to Part. Since all circles are connected by sympathetic magic, by scribing one circle the magus may connect to another circle elsewhere.''
''The benefit of this new Target is that a maga may cast a spell with Circle Target, but need not be able to reach the target to trace the circle in-place. Instead, by tracing a circle she can reach, she may affect the remote circle too.''
''The spell creates a circle of magic about the target point. The magical circle may be seen with magical senses such as Second Sight (as an invisible thing, Ease Factor 9), or detected by Intellego Vim.''
''The disadvantage is that the spell is broken if either of the two circles is broken. (Anyone who can sense the magical circle can break it as if it were a real line.)''
''The line traced must be a perfect circle (as opposed to the standard Circle Target). The magical circle is exactly the same size as the scribed circle, but locat''
''ed about the target point. Large circles require both Dexterity and Concentration rolls for each round of tracing or drawing (ArM5, page 112).''
''The location of the center point of the Arcane Circle is calculated just like a Line Range — indeed, if the Range is Line or Duration Arcane Ring, only one calculation is needed.''

===New Duration: Arcane Ring===

''Equivalent to Moon. Since all circles are connected by sympathetic magic, then by scribing one circle the magus may connect to another circle elsewhere.''
''The benefit of this new Duration is that a maga may cast a spell with Ring Duration, but need not be able to reach the target to trace the ring in-place. Instead, by tracing a circle she can reach, she may affect the remote circle too.''
''The spell creates a circle of magic about the target point. The magic circle may be seen with magical senses such as Second Sight (as an invisible thing, Ease Factor 9), or detected by Intellego Vim.''

''An irregular building is reshaped so that a single room in a building becomes perfectly regular. The spell fails unless this can be accommodated by small adjustments to the rest of the building.''
''A room so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry. The magical perfection is momentary, and then slowly fades as the building structure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial purposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or so before they settle slightly and lapse.''
''The specified room becomes regular: right-angled with straight sides, or perfectly circular (most real buildings are not particularly straight). If this is not possible because the room is highly irregular, then the spell fails. If there is any doubt, a Perception + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue. (Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need perfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less than 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without guidance.)''
''The Structure Target is needed to effect small adjustments to neighboring parts of the building to fit around the new room. (If they were not included in the spell, the structure would fall apart as the room pulled away from the rest.) The remainder of the building need not be regular — indeed may be decidedly imperfect given medieval building practices.''

''Level 2: Reshape dirt so that it take on an imperfect shape (Perdo requisite). Right angles bend, straight lines wobble, and circles kink. Irregular shapes are not affected.''
''Level 3: Substantially reshape dirt so that it takes on a perfect shape (Creo requisite). The reshaping is what workmen could achieve with magical assistance, but the result must be able to sustain itself or the spell must maintain the perfection magically. The perfection refers to geometric perfection; adjusting lines to be straight, loops into perfect circles, and near rectangles into perfect right angles.''

''R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Structure An entire building is reshaped to be perfect, if this can be accommodated by small adjustments to the whole and to the rooms within. Both the exterior and the rooms within become regular: rightangled and with straight sides, or perfectly circular. Irregularities in workmanship are easily perfected, but the building is not redesigned.''
''Normal medieval building design often prevents this spell from working: most medieval buildings have irregular extensions and out-buildings requiring redesign to count as regular — although demolition of the extensions is an easy corrective option. If the whole structure cannot be perfected, the magus can usually perfect individual rooms using Perfection of the Well-Designed Chamber.''
''A building so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry. It is also stronger and more stable against tremors and storms, and has a pleasing air to those beholding it, or living and working within. The magical perfection is momentary, and then slowly fades as the building structure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial purposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or so before they settle slightly and lapse.''
''If there is doubt about the limits of perfection, a Perception + Artes Liberales''
''(geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue. (Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need perfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less than 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without guidance.)''

''(Base 2, +1 stone, +1 Touch, +3 Structure, +1 Herbam req.)''

==Hermetic Architecture — Minor Mystery Virtue==

''Hermetic Architecture concerns itself with the construction of large-scale enchantments: of rooms, buildings, or even stone circles. It also deals with the creation of permanent paths and gateways.''
''One problem that faces many Hermetic enchanters is the problem of fitting the enchanted device into their laboratories. If the device is exceptionally large (a sailing ship) or immovable (a sacred grove), then the magus may be faced with attempting to create a laboratory around the device. At times, even this may not be possible.''
''The Mystery of Sacred Architecture teaches a number of disciplines, one of which is the placement of several enchanted devices within a larger context, in a particular and necessary pattern, so that the separate devices may be united to work as one, as though the larger whole were enchanted instead.''
''The Material and Size tables (ArM5, page 97) are extended to determine the amount of enchantment that is required. The Extended Material and Size Table, above, covers giant objects, single large rooms, groves or glades, or a single compact complex “structure.”''
''Determine the material of the large structure to be enchanted: typically this is wood, earth (soft stone), or hard stone. It is very rare for architectural constructs in Mythic Europe to be made from anything other than these substances.''
''Multiply Material cost times the Size multiplier of the structure to be enchanted; for example, to enchant a wizard’s tower of ten floors, 10 paces by 10 paces (Size 7), in hard stone is (material 4) = 28 points.''

''a Material times Size multiplier equal to that calculated for the desired structure. (If a single component does not provide a perfect match, a compound device can be invested instead: see ArM5, page 97.)''
''Finally, the magus requires a number of identical items equal to the structure’s Size multiplier, which will be placed into the structure in a particular pattern calculated to invoke resonances in the structure and so link the devices. Typically these are placed at the imagined points of an inscribed geometric shape, but some allowances must be made for the actual shape of the structure. This requires a Geometry roll:''

===Intelligence + Artes Liberales (Geometry) Vs. an Ease Factor of 6 +===


===Size Multiplier===

''Failing the roll means the magus needs to recompute the locations for the devices and ensure the structure is modified to accommodate them. This takes between one day (reposition posts in a field) and one month (carve niches in a building and fill in the previous ones). The magus can usually employ masons or laborers to perform the craft work. If the Geometry roll botches, then the error is not noticed until too late, and some disaster befalls.''
''In some cases — for example, a portal that transports people — several of the components may be combined into one physical object (such as a pair of pillars on either side), often simply using Muto or Rego Terram to shape the already''
''invested components. This option relies on harmony and symmetry to work.''
''Example: Continuing the example of the stone tower, the tower can be enchanted by creating seven identical compound devices made of silver (staffsized) with a tiny stone in each. The calculation requires a roll of Intelligence + Artes Liberales (geometry) against an Ease Factor of 13.''

===Investing the Effects===

''The component devices are each opened and invested with the effects desired for the overall structure they are to enchant, using the normal rules for laboratory enchantment, with the following exceptions:''
''The magus may use Material Bonuses from the component materials, and Shape Bonuses from both the shape of the component devices and the intended architectural structure (even though this is not present during the enchantment). Effects may be invested assuming their target is either the architectural structure as a whole, or the component devices (but this requires a Group target), or both. This includes Personal Range effects that target the device itself (they can target the combined group of devices as “self,” or the structure). Each effect must specify which target is intended. The magus may ignore the limit that Boundary Targets require ritual spells and cannot be invested in devices, providing that the Boundary affected''
''•''
''•''
''•''
''is the actual structure being enchanted by the components. The range of such effects may be Personal (affects the structure itself) or Touch (affecting those within the Boundary).''

===Completing and Binding the Enchantment===

''To link the finished component devices together, the magus places them in the locations he has devised, and casts a Mystery ritual. (This is formulated as a spell for calculations and vis consumption, but is actually a rite of the Mystery, to finalize enchanted items prepared according to the Mystery):''

===Bind the Mystical Structure===

''ReVi Gen R: Arcane, D: Special, T: Group, Mystery Ritual''
''The base level of the ritual must equal or exceed 5 + level of the highest component device effect levels. Arcane Connection Range is required for the spell effect, even if the magus can touch all of the devices to be combined: in casting the ritual, he touches one of the emplaced devices and establish a connection between them.''
''The base effect provides for a Group Target — the minimum that can include multiple components. However, extra levels of Bind ritual spell are needed to match the size of the architectural structure that is to be enchanted if it exceeds Group size.''
''(Create a conduit for spells up to (level + 5 magnitudes), +4 Arcane, +2 Group)''
''Example: To bind a level 50 enchantment into a tower (Structure-sized), the seven component invested devices must be bound together with a Bind the Mystical Structure ritual of at least level 60 (ReVi 60, R: Arcane, D: Special, T: Group: GL (50+5), +1 magnitude for increased Size from Group to Structure).''

===Breaking the Device===

''Each component device must have a special place, such as a niche, made for it.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Since a magus is limited to twice Magic Theory pawns of vis in a single season in the laboratory, the largest structures may seem too large to open.''
''However, the magus intending to apply Hermetic Architecture himself need not open the component devices for enchantment — he can attempt to persuade another magus to do so. The Mysteries of Verditius reduce the vis requirement by the magus’s Craft Score; Celestial Magic also reduces vis requirement (by the Laboratory Horoscope''
''score); and Philosophic Alchemy may be used to pre-fill an object with opened spaces, again reducing the spaces a magus need open.''
''A team involving an alchemist with Philosophic Alchemy preparing objects with opened enchantment spaces, handing over to a Verditius maga with Celestial Magic to open the device, and then to a magus with Hermetic Architecture, could together enchant some of the largest structures known.''

==Seasonal Vis Limits and Very Large Structures==


|}
''The binding ritual permits the devices to be safely removed from the places provided for them, although the architectural effect ceases while any are missing. So long as the devices and their holding places are all intact, they may be returned to their places, reactivating the architectural effect.''
''If the Bind the Mystical Structure ritual is designed with a Muto requisite, then the binding places briefly soften and meld with the enchanting devices, so that they form a united whole and cannot later be separated without breakage. For this to be work, the invested effects must not rely on any Shape Bonuses in the component devices.''

===Investigating the Structure===

''It is possible to investigate the component devices in a normal Hermetic laboratory. However, since full investiga''
''tion would need the whole structure and only components are present, the magus’s investigative Lab Total is halved.''
''Further, many such enchantments rely on the Mysteries of Hermetic Architecture or Hermetic Geometry, and these are opaque to those who do not comprehend the Mystery — they may understand that it is partly Hermetic, and the Technique, Form, and Level, but little more can be deduced.''

===Boosting Magical Auras===

''One of the greatest properties of Hermetic Architecture is the ability to manipulate magical auras and regiones, something normally beyond the ability of Hermetic magic. The following guidelines''
''can only be used by those initiated in the use of Hermetic Architecture.''

===Enchantments To Manipulate===


===Auras and Regiones===


===Increase of the Room’s Modest Aura===

''CrVi 84''
''Pen +0, constant effect''
''R: Touch, D: always on, T: Room, Mystery enchantment''
''Increases the Magical aura in a room by +1, to a maximum aura level of 5.''
''(Base 55, +1 Touch, +2 Room, +14 levels always on)''
''A standard Room is Size 6, and a tower''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|

===The Perfected Tower===

''Re(Cr)Te(He) 34 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: always on, T: Structure, Mystery enchantment''
''This enchantment effect combines the Mystery of Hermetic Geometry applied to perfect the regularity of a stone tower (or other building), with Hermetic Architecture so that the structure can be enchanted without fitting into the magus’s laboratory.''
''A basic structure has a Size of 7, so seven component devices are needed, with 28 spaces in each (Size 7 x 4 for hard stone). The magus fashions seven small wooden yokes (Size 2 x 2 for wood) and seven silver staves (Size 4 x 6 for silver), attaches the yokes to the staves and opens them for enchantment.''
''The investment process benefits from shape bonuses of: yoke +5 enhance strength of wearer (in this case: the tower), staff +4 control things at a distance, and room +6 affect everything within at once. Although the staves are not rooms, they are part of a Hermetic Architecture project to enchant a struc''
''ture, so the shape of the final project is allowed too. The Shape Bonuses amount to +15, limited by the magus’s Magic Theory (which must be at least 14 to open the devices for investment with 28 pawns of vis).''
''When the devices are finished, their correct placement is determined by a roll of Intelligence + Geometry against an Ease Factor of 13 (6 + Size 7), and the enchantment sealed by casting a Bind the Mystical Structure ritual of at least level 44 (base level 34 + 5, +1 magnitude for size increased from Group to Structure).''
''The perfection of the tower is maintained continuously, and the natural decay and imperfections of wood and stone are prevented. The tower counts as a perfected entity for Hermetic Geometry, gains extra strength, and is more pleasant to live and work in.''

===Trajan’s Arena===

''CrMe 25 Pen +0, unlimited uses, device maintains concentration''
''R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind, Mystery enchantment''
''Trajan of Tytalus wishes, for his amusement, to construct an arena that makes any combatants within it fight in a berserk rage:''
''(Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +5 levels maintain concentration, +10 levels unlimited uses)''
''The arena effect is triggered (once per round) on anyone who starts to fight, and continues on each while they continue to fight. If someone manages to stop fighting, the effect ends for him.''
''An arena is roughly a standard Boundary, 100 paces across. This is enchantment Size 8, and soft earth (x2), so has 16 spaces. The whole can be enchanted by preparing eight stone pillars.''
''When the eight pillars are ready, placing the components correctly with the proper carved symbols and such requires a roll of Intelligence + Geometry vs. an Ease Factor of 14 (6 + Size 8). The stone pillars can then be bound together with a Bind the Mystical Structure Ritual of at least level 40 (base spell level 25 + 5, +2 magnitudes for increased size from Group to Boundary).''

==Sample Enchanted Structures==

''is made of hard stone (x4), requiring 24 pawns of vis. To enchant the magus’s own laboratory is straightforward — he can enchant it in-place and need only enchant the room itself, once. (Although this does not require the structural aspects of Hermetic Architecture, aura manipulation enchantments still require the Virtue.)''
''To enchant a room other than the magus’s laboratory requires the structural aspects of Hermetic Architecture, preparing six devices each with 24 enchantment spaces, such as staff-sized silver wands (6x4). When the six staves are ready, placing the six components correctly with the proper carved symbols and such, requires an Intelligence +Artes Liberales (geometry) roll with an Ease Factor of (6 + Size 6) = 12. Finalizing the enchantment of the placed staves requires a Bind the Mystical Structure ritual of level 89, Arcane, Momentary, Room. (base level 84+5).''

===Bountiful Boundary’s Splendid Aura===

''CrVi 99 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: always on, T: Boundary, Mystery enchantment''
''Increases the Magical aura in a standard Boundary by +1, to a maximum aura level of 6.''
''(Base 60, +1 Touch, +4 Boundary, +14 levels always on)''
''A standard Boundary is Size 8, multiplied by earth (x2), requiring 16 spaces, and as an architectural enchantment needs eight components, such as staff-sized stone pillars (Size 4 x hard stone 4).''
''Example: Julia of Jerbiton wishes to increase her covenant’s aura, so she prepares and enchants her stone columns. To place the eight pillars correctly requires an Intelligence + Geometry roll against an Ease Factor of 14 (6 + Size 8). To finalize the enchantment, she needs to cast a Bind''
''the Mystical Structure ritual of at least level 114 (base level 99 + 5, +2 for increased size from Group to Boundary).''

===Enchantment of the Magnified Regio===

''MuVi(Te) 39 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: always on, T: Boundary, Mystery enchantment''
''Increases the size of a Magical regio, doubling its size to a maximum of 200 paces across.''
''(Base 4, +1 Touch, +4 Boundary, +14 levels always on)''
''Example: Alyssa has discovered a small magical regio, in which she plans to perform some mystery rites in privacy. The problem is, it is only 30 paces across — too small to work comfortably on her rites, which require more space. She therefore decides to expand the size of the regio magically.''
''A standard Boundary is enchantment Size 8, multiplied by earth (x2) = 16 spaces, and requires eight component devices such as staff-sized stone pillars (4x4). To place the pillars correctly requires an Intelligence + Geometry roll vs. an Ease Factor of 14 (6 + Size 8). To finalize the enchantment, she needs to cast a Bind the Mystical Boundary ritual of at least level 54 (base level 39 + 5, +2 for increased size from Group to Boundary).''
''Alyssa therefore carves and sets up four of the stone pillars placed around the perimeter of the original boundary of the Regio, and four more placed just next to them. She casts her Bind the Mystical Structure rite, then carries the second set of pillars to the new larger perimeter where they are set in place, doubling the size of her regio to a comfortable 60 paces across.''

===Closed Privacy of the Enchanted Regio===

''Mu(Pe)Vi(Te) 79 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: always on, T: Boundary, Mystery enchantment''
''If a regio has an open boundary, so that any who see through may step into the regio, but the inhabitants desire to close this off, they may do so.''
''This enchantment shrinks the interface of a regio (rather than the whole regio) until it falls below one pace across, when it pinches off and detaches from the adjacent regio level. (To shrink only the interface between levels adds 1 magnitude (equivalent to a Part Target) on top of the''
''The following guidelines can only be used in structural enchantments (not spells) of the Mystery Hermetic Architecture.''
''Creo Vim Level 35: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 1 Level 40: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 2 Level 45: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 3 Level 50: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 4 Level 55: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 5 Level 60: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 6 Level 65: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 7 Level 70: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 8 Level 75: Increase the level of a Magical''
''aura by +1 to a maximum of 9 — greatest increase possible''
''Muto Vim Level 4: Double or halve the linear size''
''of a Magical aura. (That is, double or halve the diameter of a circular''
''aura. Areas may be changed by a factor of four, volumes by a factor of eight.) To increase beyond double adds 1 magnitude per additional doubling, and requires a Creo requisite. To decrease beyond half, adds 1 magnitude per additional halving, and requires a Perdo requisite. If the regio shrinks below one pace across, it may “pinch off” — this can be used to close a regio by shrinking just the “interface” between levels (+1 magnitude to restrict shrinking). Level 4: Double or halve the size of''
''a Magical regio (Terram requisite). To increase beyond double adds 1 magnitude per additional doubling, and requires a Creo requisite. To decrease beyond half, adds 1 magnitude per additional halving, and requires a Perdo requisite.''
''Rego Vim Level 15: Create a connection between''
''two levels of a single Magical regio. (Muto requisite). To connect between regio levels usually requires Arcane Range and an Arcane Connection for each regio level.''

==New Aura Magic Guidelines==

''normal Size of the Target.) Any pre-existing gates remain active. There is no longer a path that can be walked between the two levels, nor can anyone see between regiones by any of the normal means — to cross from an adjacent regio level now requires an Arcane Connection and a transportation spell.''
''The base level enchantment to halve the size of a regio is 4, but for extra shrinking, the magus also needs a Perdo requisite and increased magnitude. To shrink a 100–pace diameter to below one pace, requires seven steps (halving seven times, divides by 128), so the base effect is level 35.''
''(Base 35, +1 Touch, +4 Boundary, +1 to affect the interface only, +14 levels always on)''
''Example: Julia of Jerbiton and her sodales wish to make their covenant’s regio into a secret''
''place, so she prepares and enchants the required eight stone columns (the regio is Size 8, soft earth). To place the pillars correctly requires an Intelligence + Geometry roll vs. an Ease Factor of 14 (6 + Size 8). To finalize the enchantment, she needs to cast a Bind the Mystical Structure ritual of at least level 94 (base level 79 + 5, +2 for increased size from Group to Boundary).''

===Conjunction of the Mystic Veils===

''Re(Mu)Vi 45 Pen +0, unlimited uses R: Arcane, D: Mom, T: Ind, Mystery enchantment''
''This enchantment creates a magical connection between two levels of a single magical regio, which opens when a password is spoken, allowing one to step through a doorway and emerge in the other level.''
''This effect relies on the Mystery of Hermetic Architecture, and cannot be''
''enchanted as a single device: it requires four devices, usually combined in pairs to make two tall pillars (so one may walk between the two).''
''A single gateway allows travel in one direction only; to make a gate bidirectional, the caster needs two gates (eight component devices).''
''If created as a single set, one Bind the Mystical Structure ritual will serve for all the component devices of a bidirectional pair of gates.''
''(Base 15, +4 Arcane, +10 levels unlimited uses)''
''Placing the pillars correctly, with the correct carved symbols and such, requires an Intelligence + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 11 (6 + Size 5). A Bind the Mystical Structure ritual finalizes the enchantment, to make the gate(s) function.''
