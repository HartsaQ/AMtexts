''The Matron of the Truffles rules over Magic creatures that are responsible for cultivating truffles throughout Mythic Europe. At her council, the Matron hears the pleadings of her subjects and adjudicates their differences. Characters who act with the proper deference and respect for the council and its proceedings are allowed to attend as guests of the Matron. If they prove their mettle, the Matron may ask for their assistance and reward them with unusual and valuable forms of vis.''

==Truffles of the Realm==

''The truffle has a long and storied history. Ancient Sumerians, Greeks, and Romans used them in their cuisines. Some believe that the “Death in the Pot” story of Elisha the Prophet from the Old Testament, 2 Kings 4:38–41, describes the gathering of desert truffles. In the story, Elisha sends his servant out into the desert to collect food for his group; the servant collects truffles, but they are unknown to him. The group eats the soup prepared by the servant using the truffles, but they complain that the meal is poisonous. Elisha sprinkles flour into the soup to make it edible. Obviously, truffles continue to exist in Mythic Europe. Mythic Europeans do not know why truffles grow under some trees, but not others. They only know that truffles propagate through some supernatural method and that harvesting them may result in interaction with supernatural powers. In''
''Mythic Europe the subjects of the Truffle Matron are responsible for the cultivation of truffles, and in some instances they may either encourage or discourage their consumption. The Truffle Matron’s domain extends to wherever truffles grow. When considering the five types of truffles found in the areas covered in a typical Ars Magica campaign, truffles may be found in any Tribunal except Loch Leglean and Hibernia. With the exception of Bohemian and desert truffles, dogs or sows are used to locate and extract truffles. Sows have an innate ability to detect them, but may devour the truffles before the harvester can collect them. Dogs can be trained to find truffles, but it is time consuming, and they are not as proficient as sows. The benefit is that dogs are not interested in eating the objects of their search. Other forest animals, squirrels or skunks, for instance, are also able to locate truffles, but were not historically utilized for the task. Truffle hunters also used animals to locate truffles because they believed that supernatural forces could punish someone who improperly harvested a truffle. The truffle hunters might attempt to appease the truffle guardian, but if their efforts were unsuccessful, it was hoped the animal would bear the brunt of the punishment. The nature of the supernatural agent inflicting that retribution is discussed more fully below.''

==Varieties of Truffles in Your Saga==

''Black truffles grow on the roots of oak and hazel trees in the Normandy, Provence, and Iberian Tribunals, but can also be found''
''in isolated locations in Slovenia and Croatia. The best ones grow in the County of Périgord, and a description of this region can be found on page 69 of The Lion and Lily: The Normandy Tribunal. They are purplish-black in color and roughly spherical with dark flesh that is filled with fine white veins. The black truffles are harvested in late autumn and early winter. They are known for their earthy smell and subtle, refined flavor. The typical black truffle grows about an inch or two in diameter and weighs about an ounce. Larger ones exist, but are very rare. Burgundy truffles grow on the roots of oak and hazel trees throughout Mythic Europe from the Iberia to Novgorod and Stonehenge to Thebes Tribunals. The exterior of the truffles is dark brown in color, resembling the bark of a tree, with lighter brown interior veined with white streaks. The flesh of the burgundy truffles gives off an intense, hazelnut-like aroma. Burgundy truffles are harvested in the autumn. They have bodies from one to four inches in diameter and can weigh up to four ounces. White truffles grow on the roots of oak, hazel, poplar, and beech trees. The best white truffles come from the Piedmont region, especially the area around the city of Alba, but they grow throughout the Roman Tribunal. They can be found in the south west portions of the Normandy Tribunal and the western most portions of the Provencal Tribunal. They also grow in Croatia on the Istria peninsula in the Motovun forest. For a further description of this area, see the Old Histria in Against the Dark: The Transylvania Tribunal, page 73. Their exteriors are off-white or beige, and their flesh is cream colored with white marbling. White truffles are har''

''vested in autumn. They have a very strong earthy flavor and pungent aroma. They are generally about the same size as black truffles, but occasionally grow up to five inches in diameter and can weigh over a pound. Bohemian truffles are unlike the previous varieties in that they grow above ground, do not prefer a specific variety of tree, and may grow on rotting logs. They are widespread throughout the Rhine, Greater Alps, and Normandy Tribunals. Bohemian truffles are large spherical or oval balls with a hard brown or black exterior. The flesh of the Bohemian truffle is brown or white in young specimens, but turns dark brown to purple with age. They are collected and eaten in parts of Germany, especially near Bohemia, in the spring. If allowed to mature, they develop a black viscous gel inside, which is a natural dye for clothing. Desert truffles also grow above ground, attached to rockrose shrubs or oak and pine trees. They grow in arid and semi-arid ar''
''eas around the Mediterranean, especially in North Africa and the Middle East. Desert truffles are spherical or top-shaped, with thick solid walls. They are a translucent cream to pale brown color. They tend to be about an inch across and weigh a few ounces. They can be larger, but it is rare. Locals harvest these delicacies shortly after the spring storms, which they believe create desert truffles where lightning strikes the sand.''

==Location of the Truffle Realm==

''There are several locations that are suitable for placement of the Matron’s truffle regio. Below is a list of suggested locations, but the storyguide should feel free to select another location. The only criteria are that the location should be in a truffle producing region and should be in a very isolated area''
''or, at least, an area that has been isolated until recently. Burgundy in Normandy is a good location for a truffle Matron dealing with mundane intrusion. There is a small forest outside of Dijon about halfway between the covenants of Cunfin and Atramentum Renatus. A truffle realm could also be located on the Istria Peninsula near Pazin in the Kingdom of Croatia. The dense forests of Périgord in the Aquitaine, on the Dordogne River, in the Normandy Tribunal are also excellent locations for the truffle regio. It is within 50 miles of the towns of Bergerac and Le Cité and the covenant of Nidi. The Bohemian Forest in the Rhine Tribunal is also isolated enough to be a good location for the truffle realm.  The realm could be placed in the forests of southern Bohemia, roughly equidistant from the covenant of Irencillia and the towns of Prague and Passau.''

==Common Knowledge, Uncommon Knowledge, and Lost Secrets==

''While many people know about truffles, they still hold many secrets.''
''Known By All''
''• Philosophiae allows the character to know that truffles grow under certain trees. A character with an Ability in Theology (Judaism or Christianity) knows the story of the prophet Elisha and desert truffles. A character with an Ability in Theology (Islam) knows that the hadith states truffles were manna provided by God to the people of Israel. A character with Church Lore knows that some church leaders denounce the consumption of truffles and refer to them as “witch’s fare” and creations of Satan. Characters with an Area Lore score know the types of truffles that are available in the area.''
''Widely Known''
''• Characters with scores in Magic Lore may know the following: Some truffles contain vis. Some vis bearing truffles are protected by creatures. Truffles of Virtue are rare, but contain vis and may be enriched. Characters''
''with moderate scores in Survival or Area Lore for a location where truffles grow are aware of suitable locations to hunt for truffles, what they look like, and how to prepare them.''
''Uncommon Knowledge''
''• Characters with scores in Magic Lore may know the following: An enriched Truffle of Virtue protects crops for a year and ensures a bountiful harvest. The process for enriching a truffle of vis requires an animal with Magic Might to devour it, then its scat is spread under trees that will produce truffles the next year. There are multiple types of truffles that contain vis. Some truffles are awakened. Awakened truffles may be found in large isolated forests within a Magic aura. Awakened truffles have Magic Might and often guard truffles in Magic forests. Some regiones are only accessible during specific, usually astronomically significant, days. • Characters with Area Lore scores may know specific locations where truffles can be found. A Philosophiae score grants the character knowledge about''
''more truffles, with black and white truffles being the most likely, followed by Burgundy and Bohemian truffles, and lastly desert truffles.''
''Rare Knowledge''
''• Characters with scores in Magic Lore may know the following: Truffles of Virtue are often found under Trees of Virtue. Extraordinary vis in the form of truffles is even more rare than Truffles of Virtue. Creatures with Magic Might often rule a particular area or particular type of creature. Awakened truffles often protect the trees and truffles in a Magic forest. Typical awakened truffles have a Magic Might of 10 or less. The rulers of Magic creatures usually reside in Magic regiones or powerful Magic auras. Hermetic magi have encountered more powerful truffle-like creatures; scholars surmise that they rule over the typical awakened truffles.''
''Lost Secrets''
''• Any of the information in “Researching the Truffle Regio” is considered Lost Secrets.''

==The Realm of the Truffles==

''Entrance to the regio requires a guide to open the way or, at least, provide the characters with the precise location in which to search for the entrance. Only awakened truffles or awakened trees that are members of the truffle regio know the location of and method for opening the entrance. It is in a pocket of trees in a dense wood within a small Magic aura, which only exists on the certain days, allowing the regio to be accessed from the outside four times a year — the summer and winter solstices and the spring and autumnal equinoxes. Once characters have been escorted to the entrance or provided with the location of it, they may attempt to enter the regio. To do so, one of the characters needs to possess Second Sight (ArM5, page 67) or Magic Sensitivity (ArM5, page 66), or know the spell Piercing the Magical Veil (ArM5, page 158). The rules for entering and leaving regiones are presented in ArM5, page 189. The Magic aura outside of the regio is 1, only on the solstices and equinoxes, which means that the players must roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to see inside. If the characters are near the proper location, the Ease Factor is 9 to see the entrance from each internal level of the regio to the next. Although the characters may only enter''

''the regio on four days of the year, they and the inhabitants may leave at any time. They need only follow the path from the holt back to the heart of the wood at the entrance to the regio. In addition, the Truffle Matron has the power to banish someone from the regio with only a thought.''

==Regio Entrance==

''Magic aura 3 The first level of the regio has a Magic aura of 3. The regio may only be entered on one of the solstices or equinoxes. This level encompasses the forests surrounding the truffle fields and holt. Once inside the regio, the characters step into a large forest, much like the one they left, except the trees here are improbably tall and thick. The trees all look to be centuries old. Beneath each tree grow truffles of all varieties. If the char''
''acters dig up the truffles, they can determine that some of them are Truffles of Virtue. The forest is also teeming with wildlife — wild boars, roe deer, skunks, squirrels, and other ground dwelling herbivores are present. After a while, alert characters may notice that predators are conspicuously absent. Many, if not all, of the animals in this regio are Creatures of Virtue. See the Realms of Power: Magic, page 55, for a description. With a Hunt + Perception roll against an Ease Factor of 9, the character notices a path leading away from the regio entrance. It is little more than a deer trail, but it is the only obvious choice other than blundering through the forest. If the characters begin wandering the forest, the Wild Boar of the Woods eventually intercepts them. If the characters attack any of the inhabitants of the forest or start digging for truffles, the Wild Boar intervenes, charges the characters, and may attack them if they''
''continue. The Wild Boar of the Woods challenges the characters and demands to know their reason for invading his forest. The Wild Boar informs the characters that they must respect his rules in his forest, and not harm the inhabitants. The Wild Boar considers truffles and the awakened trees to be under his protection, and he does not distinguish between them and the animals. If the characters ask for directions, the Wild Boar tells them that he can assist, but they must aid him first. The Wild Boar of the Woods tells the characters that a pack of wolves has entered his forest and is attacking the inhabitants. He would normally dispatch the wolves himself, but on this day, the truffles command him to guard the entrance to the regio. The Wild Boar tells them that he is concerned that by the time he is able to hunt the wolves, they will have killed many of his charges. This is a lie. The Wild Boar of the Wood lets in predators every solstice or equinox to keep the population of herbivores in check before driving them out or killing them. Depending on how long it takes the characters to track and kill the wolves, they may have attacked several of the forests inhabitants. The characters may attempt to locate the carcasses of the wolves’ kills. This is done easily enough, but their bodies are devoid of vis because the Magic wolves have consumed it.''

==Truffle Fields==

''Magic aura 5 The second level of the regio has a Magic aura of 5.  It may only be entered by taking the path from the first level. If the characters have the Wild Boar’s assistance, he escorts them down a trail and through to the second level before departing. Without his assistance, the characters must utilize Second Sight or cast the spell Piercing the Magical Veil (ArM5, page 158) while at the proper point on this path to advance to the next level. If the characters do not have a method to see the entrance to the second level, they keep walking and return to the entrance to the first level in a continual loop. This level encompasses the truffle fields,''

''The Wild Boar of the Woods guards''
''the entrance to the Truffle Matron’s regio. The Wild Boar is a solitary creature, but quickly lends his protection to any inhabitants of the regio that come under attack. The Wild Boar of the Woods is capable of moving between all levels of the regio. He is motivated to keep intruders out of his woods and only allow proper guests of the Truffle Matron to pass to the next level of the regio. The Wild Boar of the Woods always initiates contact with a group by charging the most combat worthy looking individual, stopping about five paces short, and using his Terror of the Charging Boar power on him. Remember that the Boars have Enduring Constitution, which reduces all Fatigue penalties by 1, so do not hesitate to use exertion (ArM5, page 173). For the Boars of Virtue ridden by the Truffle Drones and those in the Truffle field, reduce their Might to 10. The Boars of Virtue do not have the Protect the Herd or Terror of the Charging Boar powers, Magical Champion, Ways of the Wood, Tough, or Higher Purpose. The Flaws of Wrathful and Fury are Minor. As a replacement power, they have The Unimpeded Traveler power, which the Wild Boar of the Woods does not possess. Finally, the Boars of Virtue are Size 0 and have Cunning instead of Intelligence.''

''the immediately surrounding areas, and the path to the Truffle Matron’s holt. The area looks nothing like typical human fields. There are no obvious forms of demarcation between the living areas and the fields and no form of demarcation between any of the fields. Around a central clearing, a dozen large trees with dense root systems stand. The roots are intertwined in the center and are large and dense enough that footing for humans is treacherous. It is completely impassable for horses. The whole level has an overwhelmingly strong smell of freshly tilled earth, compost, and mushrooms. It is perpetually overcast, with the sun rarely breaking through the dense cloud cover, and rain falls frequently. Outside this ring of trees is another concentric ring of trees. Among the roots, the characters see approximately a dozen awakened truffles going about their business. The awakened truffles are of the type most likely to be encountered in the area as described in the “Varieties of Truffles in Your Saga” insert. If the characters enter the woods beyond the truffle fields, they encounter truffle drones on''
''patrol, who escort the characters back to the path. Game statistics and the appearance of the awakened truffles are described in the “Inhabitants of The Truffle Regio” section, later. The fields are filled with activity, such that the inhabitants do not go out of their way to interact with the characters. The fields are surrounded by forest, filled with oak, hazel, poplar, and beech trees. Without magic or Second Sight, the characters are forced to interact with the inhabitants to proceed to the next level of the regio. The awakened truffles are working among large mounds that appear to be their homes. The roots also serve as a fence to keep a sounder of wild boars enclosed. The awakened truffles are busy tending to smaller truffles, making repairs on their homes, grooming or feeding their wild boars, and the like. Through the gaps in the trees, the characters may see more awakened truffles working between the circles of trees. The area between the trees is where the awakened truffles cultivate their Truffles of Virtue. Perceptive characters notice that the branches and roots of the trees seem to move''
''at the mere touch of an awakened truffle. This is because the trees here are also awakened. See Realms of Power: Magic, page 128, for a description of awakened trees. The structures and their contents are composed entirely of earth or living wood. If the characters attempt to interact with the awakened truffles or trees, they are met with silence. Only characters with the spell Converse with Plant and Tree (ArM5, page 136) or a similar ability are able to talk to them. If the characters can communicate, the awakened truffles answer simple questions, but excuse themselves after one or two questions and return to work. They explain that the council is about to meet and they do not have time for idle chatter with “truffle eating drones.” At this point, the Boars of Virtue break out of the fence containing them. The awakened truffles stop what they are doing and begin chasing them.''

==Truffle Holt==

''Magic aura 7 The third and final level of the regio has a Magic aura of 7. If the characters assisted the truffle workers in rounding up their boars, without harming them, the truffle workers assist the characters in crossing to the next level of the regio. Otherwise, the characters must find the entrance alone, which is not difficult, assuming they can see it. The regio entrance to the third level is on a path out of the fields. If the characters are unable to see the entrance, they eventually circle back and return to the entrance of the second level of the regio. The third level of the regio encompasses the holt and surrounding grounds. The “holt” is two concentric, seamless circles of awakened trees perched on a low hill. Surrounding the holt are other smaller oak, hazel, poplar, and beech trees. Two truffle drones mounted on large wild boars wait at the end of the path leading to the outer circle of trees. More truffle drones ride wild boars among the surrounding trees. If the characters are with an escort, the truffle drones allow them to enter. If not, they wait for several minutes and a truffle daughter appears out of the ground to escort the''
''characters into the holt. The trees making the door at the end of the path rise up out of the ground on their roots and move aside to allow the characters entrance. Once inside the holt, the trees return to their original positions. The holt courtyard is located between the exterior circle of trees that forms the holt’s walls and an interior circle of trees that forms the inner holt. The courtyard is filled with lumpy, loose topsoil. It is a rich black color and emits a strong smell of compost. Against the exterior wall to the left of the path to the interior holt there are larger mounds where truffle drones are resting. On the opposite wall a sounder of wild boars''
''root about in a pen made of dense shrubs and small trees. There are several awakened truffles tending to the boars.''

==Truffle Council Chamber==

''The holt’s interior looks much like the courtyard, with dark topsoil and a strong smell of compost dominating. Large roots from the surrounding awakened trees form seats, tables, and a raised dais at the center of the circle. The seats and tables nearest the walls are filled with a handful of truffle drones, the next group nearer the dais is filled with a large number of''
''truffle workers, and the final row before the dais is filled with a small group of daughters. The Truffle Matron and her closest advisers sit upon the dais. If the characters attempt to sit, they are directed to the tables with the drones. The workings of the truffles are largely inscrutable to outsiders. Only the Matron and daughter truffles are able to speak to the humans, and they only do so when addressing them directly. Those able to follow the truffles hear discussions regarding territorial disputes between black, white, Burgundy, and Bohemian truffles; allocation of communal resources; destruction of Magic forests by humans; or loss of truffles to human poachers.

''The wolves tracked a herd of roe deer from the mundane world into the Truffle Matron’s regio. The roe deer are inhabitants, and the wolves followed them. The wolves intend to gorge themselves on the numerous magical creatures in the regio and then gang up on the Wild Boar of the Woods. The wolves gain a +3 bonus to all rolls involving the senses of smelling and hearing. The Pack Leader’s statistics are es''
''sentially the same as the other wolves, except he has Com +2, a Leadership score of 6 (specializing in combat), the additional Minor Flaw of Higher Purpose (provide for the pack), and the additional Minor Virtue of Improved Attack. A wolf is inherently cowardly and flees or surrenders if separated from the pack. The storyguide should set the number of wolves at a number to sufficiently challenge the characters. Their preferred tactic is to encircle their prey, use the Terrifying Howls to immobilize them, and then focus on incapacitating the strongest opponent before moving to the next one. Each wolf expends a point of Fatigue on its first attack to add his Brawl score to his Attack total. As long as the Pack Leader lives, the wolves fight as a Trained Group. This allows the Pack Leader, who also acts as vanguard, to add +7 to his Attack or Defense scores for each additional wolf in his pack, up to a maximum bonus of +21 (ArM5, page 172). For a further description of the wolves’ tactics, see “Hunted by Wolves” in Chapter 11: The Wolf’s Court chapter. The wolves will likely immobilize the grogs and companions, before focusing their attacks on the magi, using their bite attacks, which are not resisted by Parma Magica. Once a wolf has drawn blood, he uses it as an Arcane Connection to aid in attacking any character who initially resisted the Terrifying Howl of the Wolf. Blood serves as an Arcane Connection to the target that “lasts for years” and provides a x3 bonus to multiplier to Penetration for the wolf (ArM5, page 84). With a character’s blood, the attacking wolf has an effective Penetration of 33.''

|]
''all stare at the characters whenever issues related to the “truffle thieves” are discussed. Characters able to understand the proceedings notice that only daughters present proposals or issues to the Truffle Matron. The Matron then opens discussion to the citizens of the regio. Perceptive characters notice that daughters are given the most deference, followed by the worker truffles and awakened trees. The truffle drones are largely ignored and rarely contribute to the discussion beyond providing factual reports. The Truffle Matron allows all to be heard before giving her opinion and suggestion on the matter. Once she has spoken, her adviser calls for a vote. If the Matron expresses a strong preference, the vote generally supports her. Drones do not vote. The Truffle Matron’s goal is to expand the reach of the truffles by increasing the number of forests inside Magic auras and to protect the truffles inside those Magic forests that already exist. Unfortunately for the Truffle Matron, there are not many forests left in Mythic Europe for expansion. Rather, the truffles are losing forests to human encroachment. Although truffles are hearty, they have little ability to stop truffle hunters or foresters, especially those protected by the Dominion. Creating an Earth Elemental can slow the progress of humans, but greatly weakens a daughter. The Truffle Matron and the awakened truffles do not trust the characters for two reasons. First, they are human, and humans destroy forests and poach truffles. Second, they are magi and, in the Truffle Matron’s experience, magi have an insatiable desire for vis. This desire often means that magi collect and destroy the awakened truffles or their vis-bearing crops. The Truffle Matron hopes to use the magi’s known desire for vis to convince them to assist her. Requests the Truffle Matron may make of the characters are listed in the insert, and potential rewards are included in the following “Vis Sources” section.''

==Tests of the Truffle Matron==

''Before the Truffle Matron makes any request of the characters, she demands to test''
''their mettle. She addresses the most senior looking female, and if no females are present she asks the characters where their leader is. If a female is present, she directs all questions and responses to that character and refers to the males as her drones. The first test offered by the Truffle Matron is one of combat. The Truffle Matron’s champion mounts a Boar of Virtue, and she tells the characters to select their best warrior for single combat. The Matron selects either one of the daughters or a drone as her champion, depending on the strength of the characters’ selection. Her champion is armed with a bludgeon. Use the scuffling rules detailed on ArM5, page 174. The fight lasts until someone surrenders or is knocked unconscious. Anyone attempting to inflict lethal damage is declared the loser. The second test proposed by the Truffle Matron is one of strength. The Truffle Matron issues a challenge of a tug-of-war between the strongest member of the characters’ group and the strongest member of the council. When she issues the challenge, the truffles laugh a hearty, deep laugh. Given that the largest awakened truffle is barely four feet tall, the characters may laugh too. The challenge is, however, between one of the awakened trees and the character. The character and the awakened tree both roll a Simple Die and add their Strength + Athletics to the roll. For every Size point the awakened tree is larger than the character, add +2 to the tree’s die roll. The side with the lower total is dragged toward the side with the higher total. If the difference is less than 5, the two roll again and continue to roll until the accumulated difference between their rolls is 5 or more. Once the total of 5 or greater is reached, the losing side is pulled across the line. If the contest lasts more than two turns, the Truffle Matron awards the characters a victory. The Truffle Matron asks a gardener to bring a damaged sapling into the hall. She informs the characters that if they are able to repair the damage to the sapling and ensure that it prospers in the coming year she will grant them a victory in this challenge. The easiest method for completing this challenge is for one of the characters to prune the damaged branches and use Ceremonial Casting to cast a Spontaneous Ring/Circle version of The Bounti''
''ful Feast (ArM5, page 135). The characters earn additional praise from the Truffle Matron if they are able to grow the sapling to maturity or otherwise protect it against harm. After the characters have attempted the Truffle Matron’s tests, the truffle daughters begin a procession to present tribute to the Matron. The daughters each present the Truffle Matron with an exotic plant bearing vis. The Matron praises the truffle who presents the most unusual or exotic specimen. If the characters present the Truffle Matron with appropriate tribute, she increases their potential reward. Finally, the Truffle Matron’s adviser announces that the Matron will now hear the pleadings of the citizens. They ask the Matron to settle disputes between them, assist them in solving their problems, or request aid from the community. The citizens include truffle drones, workers, daughters, and awakened trees. Examples of potential issues are included here, but the storyguide should feel to use requests that are specifically tailored to her saga. The Truffle Matron offers a reward of vis to anyone who can solve the problems that she or her citizens cannot easily address. The Matron does not wait for the characters to offer their assistance; if they are silent, she assigns the task to a group of truffle drones or a daughter. She is generally aware of the difficulty of each task and offers a vis reward appropriate to entice someone to accept. The more tests the characters passed, the more valuable the Truffle Matron’s offer is. Through role playing, the character may be able to extract additional vis from the Truffle Matron. She offers the greatest rewards for problems raised by the daughters and the most meager rewards for problems that affect only the drones. If the characters have previously assisted the regio’s citizens, she is more generous with her potential reward, but if they have harmed any of the inhabitants or collected any vis in the regio, the Truffle Matron reduces it accordingly. If the characters have acted in an especially egregious manner, she dismisses them and tells them to complete her task without reward or never be allowed to return.''

==Mythic Locations Features of the Truffle Regio==

''This section describes some overarching features of the regio: the Creo aligned aura, examples of the vis sources in the regio, and the inhabitants of the regio.''

==Aura==

''The entire regio is an aura aligned with Creo. See Realm of Power: Magic, page 16, for a description of aligned auras. The whole area has an overwhelmingly strong smell of freshly tilled earth, compost, and mushrooms. The area is perpetually overcast with the sun rarely breaking through the dense cloud cover, and rain falls frequently. The Magic aura bonus is doubled in the regio for all activities involving Creo. Add the aura modifier to all Recovery rolls while recuperating in the aura. Creatures with Might aligned with Creo spend 1 point less Might to activate their powers while in the aura. Plants and animals grow more healthfully, stronger, and larger than normal. In addition, minor cuts and bruises heal instantly. If a character takes scuffling damage in any of the combat encounters, these heal immediately upon entrance to the truffle holt regio. For each season the character spends in the aura, his apparent age is decreased by one, but does not decrease below 27. Anyone who spends a full year in the aura receives a bonus to his Living Conditions modifier equal to the Magic aura where the character spent the majority of his time.''

==Vis Sources==

''The truffle regio contains three categories of vis: inanimate truffles, creatures, and trees. The truffles exist as Truffles of Virtue and Extraordinary Vis. The creatures are all herbivores native to lands where truffles grow. If asked why there are no predators, knowledgeable truffles tell the characters that truffles are spread by being eaten by''
''herbivores and passed through their system. Carnivores do nothing to assist truffles. Finally, the forests of the truffle regio are home to many Trees of Virtue: beech, hazel, oak, and poplar. Realms of Power: Magic, page 129, contains guidelines for both Hazel and Oak Trees of Virtue. The trees themselves use the statistics for the awakened trees above, but also have special properties.''
''Beech Tree of Virtue''
''Beech trees have a thick canopy that provides very dense shade beneath their branches. The ground around the beech tree is covered in leaves, rotting vegetation, and beechnuts. If supple branches are collected from the tree on the summer solstice they may be Enriched. The branches must be continually soaked in a mixture of wine, special herbs, and beechnuts from the tree until the autumnal equinox. The concoction must be refreshed on a weekly basis, such that all of the beech nuts from the tree are used. At the end of the soaking period, the branches are woven into a circular amulet with a spider web pattern. While the amulet is worn, the character is treated as having the Luck Virtue (ArM5, page 45). If characters collect all of the beechnuts from the Beech Tree of Virtue, they contain two pawns of Vim vis.''
''Poplar Tree of Virtue''
''The white poplar tree has very distinctive leaves, with the top side a dark green and the bottom a pale white. Select leaves and branches of a Poplar Tree of Virtue may be Enriched. The character must collect the twelve darkest leaves from the tree and the twelve palest leaves. The leaves are wrapped around supple twigs from the tree in the form of a crown. The crown of leaves imparts the Long-Winded Virtue (ArM5, page 45) while worn. The Enriched crown only grants the Long-Winded Virtue to one person, and it only lasts until the leaves become dry and brittle, about two weeks, unless magically preserved. If the characters collect the 24 most''
''perfectly shaped leaves from the Poplar Tree of Virtue, they contain two pawns of Creo vis.''
''Creatures of Virtue''
''In addition to the Boars of Virtue contained in this chapter, there are many other Creatures of Virtue in the Truffle Matron’s regio. Realms of Power: Magic, starting at page 56, includes several other Creatures of Virtue that might be present. The most likely creatures are Ravens of Virtue (page 62), Stags of Virtue (page 63), Hares of Virtue, and Mice of Virtue (both on page 67). If the characters are unable to pass to the second level of the regio, the storyguide may want to introduce them to the Wise Owl of the Forest (page 65), whom the Wild Boar of the Woods has also let in.''
''Truffles of Virtue''
''Truffles of Virtue can arise in any variety of truffles. They look like a normal truffle, except they are much larger, three to ten times larger than typical. Truffles of Virtue may be Enriched by being devoured by a creature''
''with a Magic Might of at least 5. When the truffles pass through the creature’s system, the scat may be used to fertilize a tree. If done properly, truffles grow on its roots the following year. If the fertilized tree is in a Magic aura for the next year, there is a chance that one of the truffles is a Truffle of Virtue. Judicious users of the Truffles of Virtue can fertilize one tree for each ounce the digested Truffle of Virtue weighed. If the Truffle of Virtue is used for other purposes, it is treated as two pawns of Creo Herbam Dedicated Vis (Realms of Power: Magic, page 122).''
''Spell-like Creo Herbam Vis''
''CrHe Level 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual This Creo Herbam vis takes the form of a large truffle. It can be any variety of truffle. If the Creo Herbam vis is buried in contact with the roots of a plant, it instantly heals the plant of any injury, poison, or disease. If the Creo Herbam vis is used otherwise, it is the equivalent of two pawns of Dedicated vis (Realms of Power: Magic, page 122). (Base 10, +1 Touch, +1 Size)''
''Lesser Enchantment Imaginem Vis''
''MuIm Level 40 Pen 30, 100 Charges R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group This Imaginem vis takes the form of a large black or white truffle. A few shavings (one charge) of this Imaginem vis can be added to food. The Imaginem vis infuses the food with the delicious, savory flavor of truffles. A single charge is enough to flavor up to 100 meals. Anyone offering the truffle-infused meal to a guest receives a +3 bonus on rolls to influence, persuade, or convince the guest. If the vis is used in any other manner, it is treated as four pawns of Imaginem vis. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 Size; +15 Penetration, +10 charges)''
''Lesser Enchantment Rego Animal Vis''
''ReAn Level 54 Pen 40, constant R: Per, D: Sun, T: Scent This Rego vis takes the form of a large black, white, or Burgundy truffle. The vis affects any wild boar or pig that smells it by compelling the creature to do everything in its power to devour the vis. Porcine creatures prevented from eating the vis become Berserk as per the Virtue (ArM5, page 40) and expend Fatigue on every attempt to gain access to the vis until exhausted and unconscious. If the vis is used, it is treated as five pawns of Rego Animal Dedicated vis (Realms of Power: Magic, page 122). The scent extends over approximately 30 paces. Wind conditions can affect the area influenced by the Rego Animal vis, providing directionality or increasing the area of effect up to a 60-pace radius. Wild boars or pigs with a keen sense of smell can be affected from even farther away, up to 150 paces. See Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 28, for a description of the Scent Target. (Base 5, +2 Sun, +2 Scent, +1 Size; +20 Penetration, +4 constant)''

==Awakened Trees==

''Magic Might: None Characteristics: Int –2, Per –2, Pre –3, Com –3, Str +8, Sta +5, Dex –1, Qik –5 Size: +5 Season: Spring Virtues and Flaws: Tough; Clumsy Magic Qualities and Inferiorities: No Fatigue, Wooden Personality Traits: Tree +3, Patient +2 Combat: Branch: Init +5, Attack +7, Defense +1, Damage +10 Soak: +16 (Blunt and impaling weapons do no harm.) Wound Penalties: –1 (1–10), –3 (11–20), –5 (21–30), Incapacitated (31–40), Dead (41+) Abilities: Brawl 3 (branch) Natural Weapons: The weapon statistics for the tree’s branches are Init +10, Atk +4, Dfn +2, Dam +2, which gives the same combat statistics as those listed in the spell Lord of the Trees (ArM5, page 139), when combined with a Brawl skill of 3.''
''Vis: Each Tree of Virtue contains two pawns of vis, with the Art determined by the type of tree. Oak Trees of Virtue have Auram vis. Hazel Trees of Virtue have Intellego vis. Poplar Trees of Virtue have Creo vis. Beech Trees of Virtue have Vim vis.''
''The above statistics are for the awakened trees in the first level of the regio. For awakened trees in the second level of the regio, add +2 to the tree’s Intelligence and Perception. Add +3 to both Characteristics for awakened trees in the third level of the regio. The storyguide should feel free to adjust damage downward for attacks that would do little harm to a tree. Characters may be tempted to use fire against an awakened tree in the hope of doing extra damage. The wood of living trees needs considerable drying before becoming firewood, so fire attacks should only do normal damage.''

|]
''Spell-like Herbam Vis''
''CrHe Level 60 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Boundary, Ritual This Herbam vis takes the form of a large truffle. If the truffle is allowed to mature and its spores are spread over an area up to six miles in diameter, all plants that grow within the area grow healthy and fruitful. The plants are protected from disease and blight for the year. The vis does nothing to prevent drought, hail, or other inclement weather. For further guidance, treat the effect as you would the spell The Bountiful Feast (ArM5, page 135). In addition, any trees in the target area grow truffles on their root systems. The truffles are exceptionally flavorful and worth a great deal on the truffle market. If any of the trees are in a Magic aura for the entire year, Truffles of Virtue may grow on their roots. If the vis is used in any other manner, it is treated as six pawns of Herbam vis. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +4 Year, +4 Boundary, +4 Size, +2 additional effect)''

==Inhabitants of the Truffle Regio==

''The awakened truffle inhabitants of the regio come in four varieties. The truffle workers are the weakest, and most abundant, with only a Magic Might of 10. The truffle drones have Magic Might scores of 15 and are generally mounted on Boars of Virtue. The truffle daughters and the Truffle Matron’s advisers have a Magic Might of 20, but are relatively few in number. Finally, the Truffle Matron has a Magic Might of 30, but is alone at that level..''
''Truffle Drones''
''Drones patrol and guard the second and third levels of the regio. They do not interact with the characters unless provoked. They cannot speak with humans, so only stare blankly at the characters or follow them from a distance. Once the characters enter the third level of the regio, they notify a daughter of their presence. Likewise, if the characters do anything to harm the inhabitants of the''
''regio, the drones move to defend the inhabitants and send someone to notify a daughter. Truffle drones are warriors and guards. They are also the lowest social stratum of the truffle regio. Although they act with great deference to the other inhabitants of the regio, when talking to characters, they treat them with disdain. Awakened truffles refer to all truffles and plants in the regio using feminine pronouns, except the drones, for whom they use masculine pronouns.''
''Truffle Workers''
''Truffle workers are not interested in fighting, or interacting, with the characters. They go about their business in preparation for the council for the most part. Only if the characters interfere with the workers’ homes, crops, or wild boars do they provoke a response. The workers first notify the drones and then command their Boars of Virtue to defend the fields. Workers burrow to safety deep beneath the earth and away from the fields to avoid death.''

[|

==Requests of the Truffle Matron==

''The following problems could be raised by the Truffle Matron.''
''Too Many Cooks…''
''A truffle daughter tells the Truffle Matron that the truffles in her area are being massacred by humans. The Truffle Matron requests that the magi destroy the truffle hunters and return with proof. Should the magi accept the task, they are easily able to kill the hunters and their dogs. Only later do the magi discover that the hunters were grogs and companions from another covenant. The covenant collecting the vis has not registered it with House Mercere for one of the following reasons: they do not consider it to be a significant, repeating source; it is on the border to with another Tribunal; they do not know any of the truffles contain vis; or it is claimed by a Winter covenant that rarely harvests it. How do the characters react when their fellow magi track them down or raise the issue at Tribunal?''
''Giving the Devil his Due''
''A daughter announces to the community that her area has been peaceful despite being near a large urban center. The daughter surmises that the local clergy are preaching against eating truffles. The Truffle Matron asks the characters to spread the word that truffles are the “witch’s fare” throughout the land. If the characters are successful in their attempts, truffle hunters and traders approach the characters. Initially, truffle hunters might tell the characters a pitiful story about not being able to feed their children and play on the characters’ sympathy. If this is unsuccessful, a powerful truffle merchant hires a group of thugs to run the characters out of town.''
''Cannot See the Forest for the Trees''
''An awakened tree announces to the Truffle Matron that a previously pristine''
''forest is under attack from foresters. The Truffle Matron asks the characters to stop the deforestation and replant the forest. The forest is near a recently founded monastery, which is clearing land for additional agricultural fields. The foresters are not clergy, but if the magi interfere with their efforts, the monks investigate. If the characters fail to stop the deforestation, they have to explain their reasons to the Truffle Matron. If they stop the deforestation, they may be called upon to explain their actions at the next Tribunal.''
''You Reap What You Sow''
''The Truffle Matron requests that the characters locate a new forest and seed the area with truffles. If the characters agree, the Matron offers them several Truffles of Virtue. If the characters properly enhance the Truffles of Virtue and spread them in a truffle-free forest with a Magic aura, the truffles prosper and other Truffles of Virtue grow in''

|]
''Truffle Daughters''
''The truffle daughters remain in the holt unless called upon to defend the regio. If needed, they travel to the site of a conflict by burrowing and create elementals. Truffle daughters are able to create an Earth Elemental with a Magic Might of up to 20, depending on the amount of raw material available. The daughter expends 4 points of Magic Might to create an elemental from earth, the Might of which cannot exceed the creator’s Might score. Enliven the Gross Earth is described in detail in Realms of Power: Magic, page 38. The elemental is under the control of the creator until dismissed. Earth Elementals are discussed in Realms of Power: Magic, page 135–137. Because of the daughters’’ Temporary Might Flaw, the daughters recover their Might over the course of the season unless they consume vis to speed the process up.''
''The Truffle Matron''
''The Truffle Matron remains in the holt unless called to defend the regio. If the characters seem to be causing trouble, she instructs the daughters to secure Arcane Connections to the magi and return them to her. Her Penetration is 38 without an Arcane Connection, but with a strand of hair, for example, it is 54. The Matron banishes any troublemakers rather than combat an entire group of magi. She may attempt to deceive the remaining characters by saying that she has captured the banished individuals and will kill them if the remaining characters do not cooperate. If the characters continue to attack, the Truffle Matron can create an Earth Elemental through the use of Enliven the Gross Earth (Realms of Power: Magic, page 38). She can create an elemental of up to Magic Might 30. Her elemental is equivalent to the Might 20 elemental, except that the following bonuses are added to its statistics: + 8 to Attack, +12 to Damage, and +4 to Soak. The Truffle Matron’s Temporary Might Flaw means that the Might she expends is not recovered until the end of the season or she consumes vis.''
''The Truffle Matron also possesses the power of The Oath Swearing, which is discussed in detail in Realms of Power: Magic, page 39. If all parties to an agreement swear an oath of their own free will, then when a party attempts to act in contravention of the oath, the character becomes aware that he might break the oath. If the character proceeds to break the oath, he acquires a Minor Flaw to be determined by the storyguide. The Flaw remains with the character until he re-swears the oath before the original parties to the oath. Should the characters agree to complete one of the tasks, the Truffle Matron asks the group to swear a binding oath that all will follow the terms of the agreement. The storyguide should make a written record of the agreement because its exact terms may be relevant in avoiding the effects of the Oath Swearing. The Truffle Matron requests that the promise be a binding, blood oath. If the characters refuse, she tells them that they only need worry if they intend to violate the oath. The Truffle Matron offers to return the blood to the swearing characters after the ceremony to allay their fears of allowing her to keep an Arcane Connection to them. With a drop of blood as an Arcane Connection, The Oath Swearing has a Penetration of 58.''

==New Creo Herbam Guidelines==

''Like Creo Corpus healing spells, a healing spell cast other than as a Momentary Duration Ritual actually suspends the healing process so that upon the spell’s expiration, wounds are as fresh as they were when the spell was cast.''
''Base Effect 1 Heal a Light Wound to a plant. 2 Heal a Medium Wound to a plant. 3 Heal a Heavy Wound to a plant. 4 Heal an Incapacitating Wound to a plant. 5 Heal all Wounds to a plant. 10	 Heal all damage to a plant, including wounds, disease, and poison.''

==Requests of the Truffle Matron, cont’d.==

''the forest. Although the characters may be tempted to harvest the cultivated Truffles of Virtue, this destroys the forest’s ability to continue producing Truffles of Virtue. If the characters enhance the cultivated Truffles of Virtue and spread them in the forest for several years, the forest produces enough vis-bearing truffles to become selfsustaining and the characters are able to harvest some of the Truffles of Virtue for themselves in perpetuity.''
''Splitting the Boar''
''Two powerful truffle daughters claim that a wild boar is rightfully theirs. The Truffle Matron does not want to alienate either daughter, so she instructs the characters to investigate and settle the dispute. If the characters read the minds of the daughters, they discern that both truthfully believe that the boar is rightfully theirs. In truth, the first noble attempted to capture the boar, but failed. She tracked the boar to the territory of the second daughter, who was trying to drive the boar toward a trap. While the two argued about who had the''
''right to the boar, the boar charged into the Truffle Matron’s regio and to the council chamber with the daughters in tow. If the boar is questioned, he does not believe that he is owned by either party because neither was capable of capturing and holding him. Use the statistics for the Wild Boar of the Woods for the boar.''
''Late for Council''
''One of the daughters of the council did not appear at council on the last solstice. The Truffle Matron sent a messenger to find out the reason for her absence. The messenger never returned. The Truffle Matron then sent one of her advisers, who also did not return. She asks the characters to investigate their disappearances. The growth of a nearby town and its Divine aura has forced the truffle daughter’s home into a regio and she and her guests are unable to escape it. Exiting the regio is only possible during the evening on nights of magical significance or when the Divine aura drops. The inhabitants have not discovered this yet.''

|]

==Mythic Locations Introducing the Truffle Regio into the Saga==

''The following are a few ideas for introducing the characters to the truffles’ regio. Of course, no author can know the specifics of your saga, so the storyguide is encouraged to come up with an introduction of her own. The most difficult aspect of the introduction is to pull the characters out of the covenant and prevent the players from taking the easy path of just collecting the vis and ignoring the potential stories.''

==Invitation from a Daughter==

''The storyguide could introduce the truffle regio through one of its citizens. A truffle merchant or hunter might offer to sell the covenant some truffles. Among the truffles purchased is a Truffle of Virtue or a truffle containing Extraordinary Vis. The lesser enchantment truffles above would be particularly appropriate because of the ease with which the characters should notice that they are special. After the characters track down the truffle merchant, he refuses to tell them where he found the truffles. His truffle hunting grounds are a closely guarded secret. If the characters have any facility with Mentem, or mundane means of gathering the information, they discover that the truffle hunter found the vis in a section of forest he had never before searched. After the characters extract the information from the truffle hunter, they can attempt to find more vis-bearing truffles. While searching the forest, the characters notice a modest Magic aura is present before a daughter encounters the characters. If they still carry the Extraordinary Vis or a Truffle of Virtue, she demands that they return her valuable property. If they do not, she demands that they leave her domain or be hauled before the Truffle Matron on charges of trespassing and larceny. It is unlikely the characters could be compelled to attend the council by the''
''daughter, but her description of it may give the characters reason to investigate.''

==The Vanishing Familiar==

''If one of the characters is searching for a familiar, the truffle regio could be introduced through it. The storyguide could introduce the regio when the magus and his grog track the potential familiar into the regio. The potential familiar may know of the location as a safe place to hide from predators, if it is a suitable inhabitant, or as a place to get a quick snack, if it is a predator or a threat to the Wild Boar of the Woods. It is up to the storyguide to determine how the potential familiar learned the information about the regio and whether it knows anything beyond its mere existence or beyond the first level and its inhabitants.''

==The Missing Hunters==

''The storyguide could introduce the truffle regio to the players through their ancillary characters. Assuming some of the covenfolk hunt for game, they could follow their quarry into the regio on a solstice or equinox. The Wild Boar of the Woods may allow grogs to enter, intent on using them as his predators for a time. After allowing them to kill some animals, the Wild Boar of the Woods drives them from the regio. The players might consider the introduction to be a short story for the grogs, until one of the characters notices that the furs brought back from the regio contain vis.''

==The Frightened Foresters==

''While traveling, the characters encounter some foresters fleeing for their lives. They describe a giant monster, a hill that came to life and drove them from their work site. The foresters refuse to return to the area, but are willing to give the characters the approximate location. Anyone with a Magic Lore score of 3 or higher recognizes the description as an Earth Elemental. If the characters investigate,''
''they find several dead foresters surrounded by crushed and rusted foresting tools. With some work, they can locate the Earth Elemental and the daughter who summoned it. The daughter explains that she was forced to drive off the foresters because they were destroying her domain of truffle-bearing trees. She knows that the foresters will eventually return and that she cannot stop them without assistance. She offers the characters a deal to convince the local lord to leave her forest alone in exchange for vis and an invitation to the Truffle Matron’s council.''

==Researching the Truffle Regio==

''There are several ways the characters could discover the existence of the truffle regio without leaving the covenant. What follows are three possible methods of introduction.''
''Chatty Kitty''
''It is often a problem that familiars, even when played by players, get little “stage time.” This method of introduction helps alleviate that problem. A magus of the Order has a familiar with knowledge of the regio, as discussed before in “The Vanishing Familiar” section. Either at a Tribunal or perhaps while the magus is visiting the characters’ covenant, the familiar converses with a familiar in the characters’ covenant about the days before they were bound. During that conversation, the magus’s familiar tells the other familiar about the truffle regio. Alternatively, the familiar could be commiserating with an apprentice about their lives before getting involved in the Order of Hermes and provide the same information.''
''Old Grogs Never Die…''
''When a covenant falls into deep winter, the covenfolk can either remain loyal, dying with the covenant, or attempt to escape. The characters might learn of the truffle regio''

''through a grog from the dying covenant. Although he is not able to provide the precise location of the regio’s entrance, he can guide the characters to the general area. He can also tell them that the old masters used to bring out the most wonderful smelling truffles from the regio, but never let them eat the treasures.''
''A Trip to the Library''
''While reading a summa on Magic Lore, a character notices marginalia stating only that “The Truffle Matron does not?” in a section discussing rulers among Magic creatures. The section talks about how some creatures that rule over lesser Magic creatures may take conventional titles from royalty and explain their situation to outsiders using typical terms for a medieval court, but these references are often shorthand and done for the benefit of the outsider. Magic creatures often have bizarre methods of organizing themselves. Some work as democratic institutions with the most popular member leading. Others are communal with all resources being shared according to the needs of the community. In the section describing so called “communal” organizations—organizations where decisions are based on community consensus—another marginalia discusses the Truffle Matron. The comment states, “Truffle Matron’s regio is fertile, has a powerful aura, and contains many''
''creatures of virtue. Did controlling the regio allow her to become Matron? Or is Matron nominally in control of the community’s regio? Must investigate on next visit. Also, why are warriors not allowed a voice?” The summa was owned by a long dead magus from a fallen covenant. The characters, with a little bit of knowledge of Organization Lore: Order of Hermes or a discussion with a very knowledgeable member of House Mercere, can narrow the potential authors of the marginalia to four people. One of the magi is known among scholars of the Order for writing a tractatus on Magic Lore discussing regiones. He was also known as a master of Herbam magic. In a tractatus on Organization Lore: Order of Hermes, the magus is mentioned as healing a lightning-struck ancient oak, which gave vis-bearing acorns, by burying a small truffle beneath it. The author mentions that the magus had developed a well-deserved reputation for being able to heal any plant. The Magic Lore tractatus is relatively obscure, but several copies of it exist, including one in the library at Durenmar. If the characters track down a copy, it discusses a regio filled with awakened truffles and trees that the author discovered. The author is careful not to disclose the exact location, but with the summa and tractatus together, the characters can piece together enough information to know where and when to begin the search.''

==Returning to the Truffle Regio==

''If the characters accept the Truffle Matron’s request for assistance, they must return to the regio to present their proof of completion and collect their reward. The Wild Boar of the Woods may attempt to test the characters again, depending on how their first interaction went. Of course, properly prepared characters need less assistance in traversing from one regio level to another, allowing them to avoid some encounters. On their return to the regio, the Truffle Matron forces the characters to prove themselves again. She may challenge them with the same or similar tests as in the first visit. With two seasons or more to prepare, however, the characters should be able to improve their odds of winning the tests. If the Matron decides the characters are overly prepared for the old tests, she may include new challenges. Some ideas for new challenges include the following: a hide-and-seek game against awakened truffles, a wild boar riding contest through an obstacle course, or a wild boar race from the council chamber to the regio entrance. If they were successful in completing her task, the Matron may reduce the number of tests. Should the characters complete several tasks, the Matron may dispense with the test altogether or offer a reward for their participation.''
''Should the characters pass the Truffle Matron’s tests a second time and complete her tasks, she may propose a deal for them. In exchange for protecting one of her magical forests, she offers a yearly stipend of vis. During their yearly visits to collect the vis, the Matron offers the characters additional tasks. The amount of vis should be equivalent to a typical vis source in the saga.''

==The Matron’s Tasks==

''The “Requests of the Truffle Matron” insert describes several possible requests that the Matron could make of the characters. The storyguide may parcel out the requests such that the characters have additional reasons to return to the regio. If the characters are successful in completing the tasks, the Matron may make additional requests of them. She may ask''
''the characters to set up a laboratory in a truffle woods in the mundane world. She knows that locations with magical activities can expand their auras and become more powerful over time. Her conception of time is vastly different from the characters’ and she has no idea how long the process might take. If the characters are freshly out of Gauntlet or looking to found their own covenant, the Truffle Matron may offer them a perfect location and their first vis source in exchange for growing the aura and protecting a truffle forest.''

==Successor for the Wild Boar==

''On one of their trips to the truffle regio, the characters enter the first level to find the Wild Boar of the Woods missing and the normally bucolic woods is in disarray. When they''
''meet the Truffle Matron, she tells them that the Wild Boar of the Woods is dead. A powerful creature has killed him, and the creature is hunting the inhabitants of the first level of the regio. The truffles are guarding the entrance to the second level of the regio. The Matron requests the characters’ assistance in defeating the creature. If the characters are successful, the Truffle Matron requests that they find a suitable replacement for the Wild Boar of the Woods.''

==Request of a Daughter==

''During one of their visits, the characters are approached by a daughter. The daughter barters for the characters’ assistance in a territorial dispute. She may ask the characters to encourage the mundane community to harvest the truffles of her competitor or harvest the truffles themselves. If the characters assist in this, she may later return to the characters and ask that they kill the competing daughter and her entourage. If the characters assist one side over another and are discovered, they may be blackmailed by one of the other daughters. If they kill any of the competing truffles, the survivors report their acts to the Truffle Matron. Should the Matron learn of the characters’ actions, they must explain themselves. The Truffle Matron is likely to forgive the characters, if no citizens were killed, but she does have a price. She requests that they complete a task for her, without the normal remuneration. If the characters have killed any citizens, the Truffle Matron demands reparations. She requires a payment of vis in double the amount harvested by the characters and demands that one of the characters spend one season in service for each citizen killed.''
