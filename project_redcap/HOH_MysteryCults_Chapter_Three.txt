''When we admire nature, in fact we appreciate how her beauty resembles that of humanity. We admire a fi ne, healthy tree as we admire a stout yeoman of the forest; we see a face in the clouds and marvel at his moods. We see the nature of the world in human terms, and the Fair Folk are merely these fancies given form — the tree becomes the man, the cloud becomes the face — and to admire them is to admire the essential truth that is the foundation of their being. No, I have not abandoned nature: I simply visit her now through intermediaries.''

''of House Merinita''
''Provocative, playful, secretive, sinister: like the beings with which they associate, House Merinita defi es concise description. As no two faeries are exactly alike, no two members of the House are exactly the same. They learn magic to study and serve the fae, or placate and protect them, or perhaps command and coerce them. There is no unity in the association of these magi; they are a collection of individuals with a shared Hermetic history, little hierarchy or structure, and nothing but their wild assortment of Mysteries in common.''
''These magi essentially serve two masters: the Magic and Faerie realms. They have The Gift and they practice Hermetic magic; yet they are drawn to the faeries, and appreciate their unpredictable and inspirational nature. Merinita magi thus maintain a delicate balance between this raw power of the wild unleashed, and the subtle charms and jinxes of Arcadian wonder. These are the secrets of the many''
''cults that make up their House: theirs are the Mysteries of magic and faerie combined.''
''The House is named for Merinita, the woman who swore the Hermetic Oath to Bonisagus and joined the Founders when they fi rst assembled, but many consider her follower Quendalon to be the true force behind its identity, and some erroneously refer to him as one of the original Founders. Most “Merinitae” are not given to keeping meaningful records or histories, but they do famously appreciate sto''
''ries, and some that concern the Founder and the history of the House are still told among magi who have an interest, by those who claim to have them from others who were there. One with great currency reports that Quendalon normally wore a heavy cloak with a hood that covered his eyes, and many Merinitae affect this garb on occasion.''

==History==

''Before the Order of Hermes was formed, Merinita was already well known, at least by reputation. It was said among other wizards of the time that a whitehaired woman dressed in green traveled alone through the wild lands of Europe, often vanishing into the great forests without a trace of her passing, a woman without equal in nature magic. She could see everything that happened in these places, she knew every bird and beast that lived in them, she could take any shape she chose, and she could command the spirits of the very trees themselves. Yet she was not savage, according to those who had met her, but wise; a woodswoman and healer at home in the forest and perfectly attuned to the wild. She was also intensely shy, and said to only speak when absolutely necessary.''
''Trianoma devoted an entire year to searching for Merinita, to invite her to come with her to meet Bonisagus and to join the Order of Hermes. Many times she approached one of the dark forests where Merinita was rumored to dwell and called out her proposal to the shadows of the trees, but never received''

''an answer. Yet in 767, as the Founders gathered to discuss Trianoma’s vision, Merinita emerged from the forest and quietly joined their circle. Her reasons for joining were never clear; her followers say that she herself did not know why, but felt compelled by a will greater than her own, as if the forest itself required it of her.''

|}
''Merinita’s oath to the fl edgling Order was binding, and she timidly went to Bonisagus to teach him some of her powers in return for his Parma Magica. According to the few surviving accounts, this was a tedious process, for though Merinita obviously knew a great deal, especially about healing and nurturing plants and living creatures, there was little that she could fi nd to teach Bonisagus, either because she was unable to communicate her mystic understanding, because he had already adapted the ancient healing rituals she practiced into Magic Theory, or because she was unwilling to share all of her secrets.''
''She eventually demonstrated the ability to join her mind, body, and spirit with an animal, and this was integrated into Hermetic teaching as the enchantment that binds a maga to her familiar. The fi rst ever such creature was a great stag, summoned to Durenmar by Merinita. This beast, the maga tersely explained, was her kindred spirit,''
''whose thoughts and feelings she shared. Magical cords bound him to her and her to him, and joined their hearts and minds as surely as if they were one person. She identifi ed three cords that created this bond, though she indicated that there could be others.''
''After the Founding, Merinita did not immediately seek out followers as other Founders did. She became very close to Birna, the Founder of House Bjornaer, for the two of them shared similar philosophies. Where Birna had a deep, spiritual connection to the wild through her heartbeast, Merinita had a comparable relationship with nature through her familiar. Together they adapted rites from many ancient wilderness cults, creating the Initiation ceremonies that Birna and Merinita used to teach others their secrets.''
''As word of the new Order spread throughout Mythic Europe, many wouldbe wizards traveled to the Rhine from distant lands in search of the lady in green, to study her Mysteries and learn from her wisdom. She eventually accepted these disciples as her followers, and taught them what she could of Hermetic magic. She encouraged them to spread out and settle in many different parts of the world, and she often traveled among them, guiding and nurturing them as she had once done for the forests. In time, however, the duration and frequency of these visits dwindled.''
''Then, sometime before the ninth century, Merinita simply disappeared. Her followers had expected to see her at the Grand Tribunal in 799, but she never arrived and left no word, and it was only later that some of them recalled her having spoken about being on the verge of a discovery, what she called “the mystery of the eternal spirit of the wild.” She was last seen 14 years previously near Bohemia, and many guessed that she had gone south into Hungary or east into Poland, though others speculated that she had lost herself in one of the many great forests in the area.''
''In her absence, the House was to be guided by her eldest follower, a magus named Quendalon (Cuin-dallán, “little blind sovereign”), one of the fi rst who had sought out the Founder to become''
''her disciple. He was originally from the Ulster region of Ireland and had been raised among the fae, and believed that his Hermetic magic could be dramatically improved with their gifts. He had spoken with the Founder about this, and after the Grand Tribunal, he declared his intention to visit the faeries that lived in a certain forest in Bohemia. He announced that until he returned, Merinita’s next-eldest follower, Myanar, would be Prima.''
''Myanar took up governance of the House from her own covenant, also in Bohemia, at the site of Merinita’s fi rst home. Several other magi joined her there, including three hunter-priestesses of Artemis who had traveled from Asia Minor to join the House, and a Roman master of shape-changing. Myanar herself came from Bulgaria, and was descended from a mythic lineage known as the Line of Muj; one of her ancestors had made a pact with a magical guardian spirit of the Balkans, which blessed him and his children with supernaturally great strength and power over storms.''

==Mystery Cults The House Divided==

''What happened then is very diffi cult to piece together, as the next few years included some of the strangest events in Hermetic history, fi lled with terrifying violence and upheaval uncharacteristic of the House. What few details survive from fi rsthand accounts are contradictory and garbled, and even the dates are confusing and do not always make sense. Yet as far as can be determined by those who have carefully studied the House Divided (as Merinitae have come to call it), the sequence of events proceeded as follows.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Two years after Myanar became Prima, a stranger arrived at her covenant, announcing that he was Quendalon and had returned to resume control of the House. He did resemble the former magus, but he was obviously not human, having two bright rubies instead of eyes. Myanar questioned him about his supposed transformation; he claimed that he had become a faerie in Arcadia, trading his useless human eyes for faerie sight. He also said he had uncovered deep mysteries on his long journey that would revolutionize the Order of Hermes. This knowledge required him, he said, to guide House Merinita in an exciting new direction.''

|}
''To Myanar, it seemed that this faerie being was an imposter, a changeling who had replaced Quendalon and sought to take over the House, and she refused to comply. This angered him, and he warned that she would suffer dire consequences if she did not obey him. Their confl ict escalated into a magical battle, but Myanar was unable to prevent him from escaping. According to letters that Quendalon wrote afterward, Myanar opposed him on ideological grounds, recognizing him full well and swearing that “she would not allow him to deform the House with his distorted visions of the future.” Yet Myanar told her followers that the false Quendalon had bragged about having found and killed Merinita, and had threatened to kill all of them if they did not accept him as hierophant of their cult.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''War broke out between the two factions. The faerie Quendalon traveled throughout the region, gathering support from Merinitae and others against Myanar''

|}
''and her followers. Most of them were curious about his new powers and anxious to learn what he had to teach, and so pledged to accept his leadership. He established a covenant called Irencillia near the faerie forest he had entered, and Myanar led a hasty strike against them. Her force was routed, and it appears that she was slain during the battle. Supposedly, those of her force that remained surrendered to Quendalon in 802. He cast them out of the House, but they were later accepted into House Bjornaer. All this was reported''
''at the Grand Tribunal of 817; Quendalon came with two of his followers who supported his story, and while many questioned him, no one contested his description of events.''
''Other accounts suggest that the war was not so easily won. Some of Myanar’s followers later claimed that Myanar did not die, but rather was transformed into a snake during the fi rst assault, and that in that form she led other attacks on Irencillia in 804 and 806. Some say that faeries participated in the defense of the covenant. It''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Before Quendalon introduced Faerie Magic to the House, Myanar and her followers focused entirely on Merinita’s Mysteries of nature and life, and many of these secrets came easily to Myanar, for she had a special affi nity for nature through her family’s ancient tradition. Other magi descended from this ancestral Line of Muj still live in the Transylvanian Tribunal, and belong to House Tremere. To represent their hereditary magical powers and background, such characters should choose Close Family Ties, Affi nity with Auram, Great Strength, and Mountain Lore (see Nature Mysteries, below) during character creation.''
''A rivalry has developed between a group of these Tremere and a nomadic family of Merinitae, led by a Novgorod maga named Merinugalaudabila. She''
''takes great delight in certamen as a sport, and especially enjoys variations on “the game,” as she calls it. Because of her efforts, interest in magical competition is growing within the House, and a few of her followers have developed the magical focus in certamen that is typically only found in Tremere’s lineage. Together they have invented two unusual dueling styles (see House Tremere, Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, for details). These were designed mostly to embarrass the staid Muj, many of whom know the events of the House Divided and bear a familial grudge against faerie Merinitae on Myanar’s behalf. The two groups often fi ght for no obvious reason, spuriously challenging each other on what seem very fl imsy pretenses whenever they happen to cross paths.''

==The Line of Muj==

''Suspicions that the faerie Quendalon was not who he claimed to be seem more likely when considering the evidence of other instances when faeries have taken human shapes and tried to pass themselves off as magi. In the 1100s, for example, an unremarkable magus named Zurenzialle disappeared from his covenant in the Greater Alps suddenly and without warning, and when his sodales decided that he was dead and entered his laboratory, they discovered evidence that he was never human at all, but a faerie being who had been pretending to be a magus.''
''To this day, the magi of House Merinita still speculate about whether it really was Quendalon who returned to govern the House. It is a moot point now, whether he was the former Primus or a faerie in disguise, as his legacy remains an integral part of their magic, for good or ill. In fact, it could be detrimental if it were to come to light that he really was an impostor; such a revelation might tarnish all they have done since, and undermine everything his followers have used his Mysteries to accomplish.''

==A Faerie Fraud?==

''is also said that Myanar was distantly related to Tytalus the Founder, who came to Bohemia in 807 with the public intention of challenging the Queen of the Faeries, and who disappeared into the Maddenhofen Woods that same year. Some speculate that Myanar sought him out and asked for his aid against Quendalon — they reason that his presence in the turbulent region could hardly be a coincidence — and that she went with him into the forest to confront the false Primus and the faeries behind his bid for power.''

|}
''Quendalon caused great ill-will between Houses Merinita and Tytalus at the 817 Tribunal by laughing loudly during their account of their Founder’s disappearance. He later explained that he was not mocking Tytalus’s ambitious attempt to defeat “the Queen,” but found it amusing that his followers would perceive his end as tragic. He gave them the impression that he knew more than he was saying, but would not speak of it further. Since then, House Merinita and House Tytalus have often been at odds, their poor relationship aggravated by the possibility that Quendalon might have known what happened to their Founder, or even been somehow responsible for their loss.''

==200 Years After==

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Quendalon returned his attention to adopting faerie ways within his House,''

|}
''teaching his followers and others who came to learn from him the secrets of Faerie Magic. For years he acted as lead Mystagogue, performing hundreds of Initiations and teaching many promising apprentices throughout the ninth and tenth centuries. Sightings of him became much less frequent in the mid-900s, and he sent delegates to the Grand Tribunals of 931 and 964, though none of them could say what had become of him. There were many rumors that he had gone mad, and most suspected he had returned to Arcadia forever.''
''At the Grand Tribunal of 997, the assembled Merinitae fi nally decided they would have to choose one of their number to take his place, though they did not all agree that Quendalon was dead. By surprising consensus the leaders of the various groups named a timid young maga named Rhiannon as Prima; she was four generations descended from Quendalon, and they believed she would best represent the House’s interests. She hesitantly accepted the position, moved to Irencillia, and for the most part avoided other magi.''
''The outbreak of the Schism War came only a few years later. Rhiannon was not a strong orator, but spoke many times in defense of House Diedne, and openly voted against their Renunciation. Many think that she invited a number of Diedne to join her House to escape destruction, and during the war some Merinitae actually fought with the Diedne in battle. They did not ever join with Diedne offi cially,''
''however, and the Order was anxious for peace during the aftermath, so House Merinita never suffered offi cial retribution for these acts.''
''Rhiannon reputedly died of old age, and her bones were returned to her Hibernian homeland to be buried. The Primacy eventually passed to Vinaria of Irencillia, said to bear a striking physical resemblance to the Founder. She was much more politically active than her predecessor, and was most famously concerned about the Magic realm fading with the spread of the Dominion. She believed that wild places of power were becoming increasingly smaller and weaker as civilization encroached upon them, and often argued that House Merinita is as much magical as it is fay, that its members would surely feel the negative effects of the loss of the wilderness as keenly as other magi.''
''She made many overtures of friendship to House Bjornaer, as the relationship between the two Houses had been sour since Myanar’s exile, but she could give them no support for their actions during the invasion of Rügen in 1168, and much of the progress she had made toward reconciliation was undone. The next Bjornaer Primus, Urgen, declared that she was senile and useless, and refused to grant her an audience. Vinaria disappeared in 1202, much the same way as Merinita and Quendalon had done, giving control of the House to Handri, senior magus at Irencillia. Mystifyingly, she later returned in 1209, but has since made no attempt to resume the primacy.''
''More information about these magi and their domus magna, Irencillia, can be found in Guardians of the Forests: The Rhine Tribunal.''

==The Future of the House==

''By 1220, Merinitae have become a contrary crowd of disparate groups, rarely agreeing on anything and hardly interacting with one another at all. Outsiders suspect that this lack of unity is a front for other, secret goals and machinations. For example, they may be establishing good relations with faeries so that they''

''If Merinita is still alive, perhaps her familiar also lives. A group of hunters tells a story of a magnifi cent stag they could not fell in a nearby forest, and this might lead to an investigation, perhaps to track down the Founder by following the cords that bind her to the great beast. Some say Quendalon went mad and tore out his eyes before disappearing, but that these precious stones were lost. They were invested with great magic, but also cursed to slowly transform the possessor into a''

Its thoughts make no sense but it burns with vengeance. Those who know the history of House Merinita might wonder: could this be Myanar?''

==History Story Seeds==

''may one day slip away to Arcadia, leaving the Order and Europe forever. Or perhaps they intend to side with the fae when they inevitably war against humanity, and so buy a place in the new faerie hierarchy.''

|}
''Many Merinitae think that Faerie is permanently slipping away, that the golden age of the faeries is past, and that the Dominion’s slow encroachment over all human civilization is unstoppable. Others stridently protest, and rebuke those who say this, for if believing makes it so, those who proclaim Faerie’s ruin are themselves destroying it with their predictions. It is no wonder there is little agreement among them on these matters, since they are very quick to turn on themselves, and like the faeries do, often fi ght with each other more than outsiders.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''If there is anything that the members of the chaotic House can agree upon, it is that in order for the faeries to survive, the Merinitae must preserve and protect the few remaining places given over to Faerie, or help those who dwell there to adapt to the landscape of the rapidly changing world, or else quit its boundaries entirely and accompany them to the lands beyond living.''

|}

==House Society==

''House Merinita is a single Mystery Cult made up of many different groups, each of which has its own ideas about magic and how it relates to the Faerie realm. Besides their Mysteries, they have little in common; about the only thing they agree upon is their interest in faeries, though even then that is not always the case, for Merinita herself had nothing to do with them, and others similarly eschew their alien ways and focus on other types of magical study. Yet every member of the House usually undergoes some sort of test involving the fae as part of her Initiation, so all Merinitae have some experience with them.''
''Four different aspects of Faerie are described below, to help players defi ne their characters’ attitudes toward the realm. These include the land of Faerie, belief in faeries, what faeries want from''
''humanity, and the relationship between the Faerie and Magic realms. This section is intended to give an idea of the sort of things Merinitae do, and so provides minimal information about faeries in general, instead describing them from the perspective of Hermetic magi and the House. (Faerie society from the faeries’ viewpoint will be addressed in future Ars Magica supplements.)''
''Each section also describes a dedicated group of Merinitae who pursue common goals and Initiate followers into certain of the House Mysteries (see Mechanics of Initiation for details on this process, and Merinita Mysteries, below, for descriptions of the new Virtues, Flaws, and Abilities they may Initiate). All those who join one of these groups must fi rst Initiate Faerie Magic to join the House, and must have at least House Merinita Lore 1 to proceed into the Inner Mysteries.''

==The Search for Arcadia==

''Arcadia is the highest manifestation of the Faerie realm, and for many magi it is the focus of their faerie magic. It is why they belong to the House, and the purpose that occupies their spare time. Merinitae know more about Arcadia than any other magi, and some guard this knowledge jealously while others share it with anyone who takes an interest. For many, it is a rite of passage: they cannot truly appreciate the fae until they have visited their home.''
''There are many confl icting beliefs in the House about what Arcadia actually is. That is, magi know it exists, they know it is associated with Faerie in the same way that Heaven is associated with the Divine and Hell is associated with the Infernal, and many of them know how to get there. But where did it come from, and why does it exist, and what is its relationship to the mundane world and the other realms?''
''Some say that Arcadia is a refl ection of Mythic Europe, and that the faeries who live there are merely distorted versions of reality. Yet it is also part of Mythic Europe, they say, in that the things one does in Arcadia have an effect on reality, and are refl ected back upon the''
''inhabitants of either realm. Arcadia is said to be a nexus of possibilities, a temple with a thousand doors, where it is impossible to return to the exact same place you left. For this reason, Merinitae caution visitors to “travel lightly:” to take nothing and leave nothing, lest their journey have repercussions and consequences for which they are not prepared.''
''Others emphasize that Arcadia is only what travelers believe it to be. It is a land of wishes and dreams, they say, that responds to their direction and changes to accommodate their hopes and fears. A person can only navigate Arcadia by moving from one desire to another, they say, and the nature of the place absorbs these desires and makes them its own, stealing them from the traveler and changing in response. For an expedition to succeed, visitors must discover what it is they truly want. Yet, having attained it, they must also have a powerful reason to return, or they will have no desire to leave.''
''Another theory is that like Heaven and Hell, Arcadia is an afterlife, a place where faeries go after they leave their''
''physical bodies. Instead of a place of eternal punishment or eternal reward, it is where beings that do not have souls must remain forever. Thus, it is populated by the spirits of living things in exile. Some suggest this includes forgotten beasts of legend, lost children who died unbaptized, and even gods who are no longer worshiped. Those mortals who die in Faerie, it is said, join this group; their souls go elsewhere, but their spirits remain in Arcadia.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''There are many ways to reach Arcadia, usually by traveling through faerie regiones. There are also gateways scattered throughout Mythic Europe, usually at places where reality and fantasy have blurred together. These points are almost always watched by guardians who patrol the borders of Faerieland, perhaps ensuring that outsiders are turned away, or perhaps preying upon them before others do. Initiates into the Mystery of Arcadian Travel can make temporary gateways to Arcadia, and these places are not necessarily guarded, although they are not necessarily safe, either.''

===The Wayfarers===

''Some Merinitae reason this way: Arcadia is a physical place, they say, therefore it must exist on earth. Perhaps it is a regio that overlaps Mythic Europe,''

|}
''stretching above and below it, only accessible at certain places or certain times; or perhaps it is a continent on the other side of the globe, with portals connecting corresponding points between the two lands; or perhaps it is a microcosm, a world within a world that is completely contained in every individual thing. Wherever it is, by plotting the connections between the two worlds, Merinitae believe they can achieve greater insights into Faerie and Earth.''
''The Wayfarers are a group of Merinitae who style themselves as Arcadian experts. They record the locations and destinations of earthly gateways, act as guides for travelers to the realms of Faerie, and sometimes lead expeditions into uncharted regions of the world in search of alternative routes. They might be ambassadors, diplomats, or guardians. Some of them might write guides to Faerie customs, travel, and inhabitants, while others might seek to destroy these gateways to ensure that no one stumbles into them accidentally.''
''These Merinitae typically teach Hermetic Initiates Arcadian Travel. They have no specifi c progression of Mysteries after that, instead favoring secrets that will help their followers on their adventures. These might include Independent Study, Ways of the (Land), Spell Timing (spells that endure while the target is traveling), or Symbolic Magic (with an emphasis on names and places). They tend to seek out characters who are already Well-Traveled, and often integrate a fantastic expedition of some kind into their Initiation ceremonies.''
''The Wayfarers have been known to associate closely with House Mercere, as Redcaps also engage in exploration and travel, but more commonly the two groups work against each other. There is a kind of unspoken rivalry between them as they race to be the fi rst to discover new parts of the world, unusual new species, or even simply new sources of vis. Those who discover them typically name these fi nds, a source of great honor and occasional jealousy among the participants. Wayfarers may also compete in this way with magi from other Houses, other Merinitae, or even fellow Wayfarers.''
''This practice has led to a strange phenomenon in the world of Faerie. Names have great importance to the fae, as they are essentially a part of the individual (and a common source of sympathetic magic). In places that have been named after something, occasionally a faerie version of that thing will appear. For example, if a faerie dell were to become widely known as Victor Valley (after Victor of Mercere from Semita Errabunda), a faerie named Victor who shared many of Victor’s reputed qualities might come to inhabit it. For this reason, some Wayfarers have adopted the practice of naming their discoveries after famous magi or legendary places of old. Who knows what they might subsequently discover in Merinita Grove or the Arcadian Sea?''

==Arcadian Experiences==

''Arcadia is a fantastic place that can have a powerful infl uence over magic and faerie powers alike, but the mechanics of it are beyond the scope of this book. However, Merinitae will almost certainly seek it out, and for those of them who fi nd their way there the storyguide should prepare an adventure, describing the experience in any way that seems appropriate to the journey. It might be an otherworldly vision, a dream, or even a nightmare; perhaps it resembles Wizard’s Twilight; perhaps it seems the complete opposite of the real world, or it might only differ from the real world in very subtle but important ways.''

|}
''just in the Order of Hermes, but among the people of Mythic Europe at large. It is an accepted fact among many in the House that faeries come about from widespread belief in them; that within the Faerie realm, things are what people believe them to be. This is not demonstrably true, of course, since it is diffi cult to measure when someone truly believes in something and whether there is a corresponding effect in Faerie, but the theory is that when someone invents a story, that story will come to pass, either in Arcadia or somewhere in the real world.''
''Extending the idea of a direct relationship between Faerie and storytelling, many believe that faeries can never die, so long as their stories are still remembered. Each time the tale is told, the characters perform their parts as described, perhaps altering slightly from the framework as the narrator embellishes, but always acting as they are defi ned by their characters, and returning each time the story is begun again.''

''Other Merinitae hold that the stories are created by the fae, that the events of''

|}
''famous “fairy tales” are simply chronicles of history, having actually happened at some point in the past. These themes have seeped into the collective subconscious of the people, and thus have a ring of truth about them that makes them compelling. Or perhaps they are visions of the future, since time has no little meaning in Faerie; these stories may be glimpses of events that will someday come to pass, resonating through the years to infl uence medieval thought.''
''In any case, stories are very important to those with an interest in the fae, and House Merinita has a strong oral tradition. Recording stories is almost as important as participating in them. It is not seen as bragging or putting oneself forward to tell one’s sodales about an experience with the faeries, and many magi in the House employ minstrels to create popular songs or poems about their adventures. Not only for Merinitae, in fact, but for the faeries themselves, as such accounts have great value in their courts.''

===Keepers of the Thousand Tales===

''The Keepers of the Thousand Tales are a group of Merinita magi and their companions who originally formed in the Holy Land with the goal of collecting, cataloging, and distributing the greatest stories of their time. This began with the beginnings of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights sometime in the ninth century, and as the society grew, their scribes added to the collection. They also translated many Greek texts into Arabic, and then from Arabic into Latin, and spread these books throughout the Order while their Hermetic leaders sought out more stories to tell.''
''Essential to their philosophy is the idea of faerie immortality through legend. By ensuring that the tales are easily available, they believe that they keep these stories alive in Faerie. In this regard, they maintain that what a signifi cant number of people believe directly affects the inhabitants of the Faerie realm. Therefore, all''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Most fairy tales with which players are most familiar became widespread in relatively modern times. However, they often concern medieval characters, and in fact contain many themes that can be found in folk tales going back to ancient times. Recognizable versions of such stories as “Cinderella,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” and even “Little Red Riding Hood” can be found in early Roman histories, and other related concepts have their roots in antiquity, such as the Roman host newly come to wealth who described himself with the phrase qui fuit rana nunc est rex (“the man who was once a frog is now king”).''
''Thus, “modern” fairy tales can be a good source of inspiration for medieval faerie stories. Do not feel that you cannot incorporate these elements into your game because they are somehow out of period. Most faerie stories are based on folk tales, and everyone in the game should be at least dimly aware of the most common characters and situa''
''tions associated with these tales, since their characters would probably have heard them as children. As most players are more likely to be familiar with the Grimms’ versions than, say, the tragedy of Cupid and Psyche or the fabulous lais of Marie of France, you should feel free to rely on their knowledge of the modern stories for faerie elements that make for a better gaming experience.''
''It should be noted that the attitude of early chroniclers was one of condescension and disapproval for such aniles fabulae (“old women’s tales”), and they often changed the stories to downplay their fantastic elements. By the Middle Ages, many of these fanciful stories have instead become accounts of holy saints and evil demons, rather than innocent maidens and monstrous beasts. Perhaps players can infer from this that the Faerie realm as a whole suffered with the expansion of the Dominion, losing many of its inhabitants to the Divine or the Infernal, and that it has only just begun to recover its former status.''

==Faerie Tales==

''those who belong to their society must do their part to see that the tales spread. Some of them are scribes, copying books of lore for other covenants and magi, and some of them are wandering storytellers, performing re-enactments of adventures for those who are interested in hearing.''

|}
''Some of the magi have begun to carry their philosophy a step further. By acting out famous stories using their magic, themselves taking the part of a character in the story, they believe they take on that character’s identity and so ensure their own immortality. Over time, they actually become the character in the story, and so become faeries themselves. These magi believe that several characters in the Thousand Tales are magi who have passed into Arcadia.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''While originally there were only a few magi devoted to the group, since their founding they have spread throughout Mythic Europe, and have dedicated covenants in both the Levant and the Iberian Tribunals. Many of them have the Outsider Flaw. Elder members often trade Initiation into the House Mysteries in exchange for seasons spent serving the society. These Mysteries might include Enchanting (Storytelling), Charm Magic, Story Magic, and Becoming.''

Combining the overlapping elements of both, the Initiate must create an original piece, one that both cultures would recognize, but that changes the ending or overall meaning (+3). (These tasks could be tested with two Intelligence + Language rolls and a Communication + Language roll against Ease Factors of 12, though the storyguide might prefer to roleplay the process instead.) With this new tale, the Initiate must visit a powerful faerie in a Faerie regio on the longest day of summer, and perform her work. This must please the faerie enough that it rewards the Initiate with a treasure (+3). The Initiate must take this prize to her Mystagogue, and at an auspicious time based on their horoscopes (+1), they must sit upon a hilltop with a Faerie aura, taking some sort of intoxicating substance with them. The Initiate and the Mystagogue partake of this while telling each other stories until they fall unconscious. When they awake, the treasure will have vanished (+1).''

==Do Faeries Dream of Counting Sheep?==

''Faeries are defi ned by their interest in humanity: they want to interact with things of the mundane world, and they enjoy the company of people. But if faeries are the realization of human imagination given life, what do they actually''
''want from them? What can followers of Merinita give the Fair Folk, while appreciating, studying, or interacting with them for their own reasons?''
''Creatures of Faerie can take any imaginable form, but have great diffi culty reproducing. They cannot invent anything new. Some Merinitae believe the faeries admire (or envy) humanity for their ability to create, and seek them out to experience the miracle of this for themselves. Many of the fae cannot resist a good story, or a treasure of their very own, or even a new name, since these are all things that contain the spark of originality. Thus, the House often encourages such artistic endeavors on the faeries’ behalf.''
''Other faeries fear that they will be forgotten. If they recognize that they owe their existence to human belief, they can ensure their continuation by encouraging the people to honor them, perhaps even worshiping them like the gods of old. Libations poured over Faerie stones, prayers intoned in sacred groves, men and women dancing around ceremonial fi res, young children abandoned in dark places — many faeries recognize these as ancient rites of respect, and reward those who perform them.''
''Some faeries perceive Mythic Europe as a place of forced exile from Arcadia, and want nothing more than to return to their fabled homeland. The means of accomplishing this are not clear; some Merinitae think it requires an invitation from a sovereign of Faerieland, others imagine that it requires a fundamental change to the faerie’s nature. One school of thought suggests that death allows the faerie to escape the confi nes of reality and return to Arcadia, but it seems impossible to prove this for certain.''

===The Shadow-masters===

''The philosopher Plato once described a cave where a group of prisoners sit chained in front of a wall. Behind them, shapes of people and animals pass in front of a great light, casting their shadows where the prisoners can see them. As far as the prisoners know, these shapes are real. They know nothing of the fi gures''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Many Merinitae believe that there is a connection to Arcadia in every person’s mind. This is because they think dreams somehow infl uence and are infl uenced by the Faerie realm, which they consider to be the collective dreams of all humanity. Thus, faeries may occasionally be found to inhabit a person’s imagination, accessible with Mentem magic and the specialized Dream Virtues of The Mysteries Revised Edition.''
''Characters with the Merinita Mystery Arcadian Travel can open trods into Arcadia through their dreams, if they wish. The maga produces a charm designed to lull the travelers to sleep, and they then journey to a dream-based Arcadia in spirit instead of fl esh. While away, sleeping characters do not age or suffer ill effects of going without food or water, though they can die through other means — and if they do, their spirits remain in Faerie.''

==Faerie and Dreams==

''that cast the shadows; they only know them by how they appear upon the wall. Plato used this idea to describe humanity’s imperfect understanding of the realm of forms: like the prisoners, they cannot see the things that cast the shadows; they only see the shadows themselves.''

|}
''The Shadow-Masters are a troupe of Merinita magi who teach that the elements of this allegory correspond to the four supernatural realms. The light comes from the Divine, and the darkness is the Infernal; the light creates the images, while the darkness tries to envelop and destroy them. Men and animals step into the light, and this is magic: imperfect copies of their forms are projected against the wall that represents the mundane world. Yet it is also possible, these Merinita say, to fashion false fi gures and move them into the light, casting gray shadows that convince the prisoners that they see something that isn’t real at all, and this is Faerie’s role in the allegory: shadow-puppets with substance.''
''Members of the society learn to play with these philosophical illusions, in a sense constructing shapes from dross and scraps and leading them to a new existence before the light of creation. The whole world is their theater: they conjure heroes and villains and set them against each other in great set pieces, enacting and re-enacting famous stories and legends, or inventing completely new tales of wonder and fear. By observing how humanity responds to these stories, the Shadow-Masters gain insight into the nature of the world, while simultaneously reinforcing belief in the strange and imaginary.''
''It has become a tradition within the group to host a tournament every few years, called the Great Play. A ShadowMaster builds a labyrinth, castle, or other intriguing setting for the event, which she fi lls with illusory obstacles, traps, puzzles, or people. It is usually built around a theme, such as Homer’s Odyssey, the Crusades, or “Beyond the Lunar Sphere.” When it opens, other Shadow-Masters, hopeful Initiates, faeries, and even a few unwitting passersby descend upon the fi eld and do their best to answer the challenge. The only formal prize for succeeding is the responsibility to host the next''
''event, though the leaders of the Great Play often reward the participants in other ways, and those who attend but do not belong to the group are almost always invited to join.''
''Society elders typically Initiate new members into the Mysteries of Glamour, Animae Magic, and Perpetuity. Many of them have a Major Magical Focus in illusions, and they most commonly live in the Transylvanian and Theban Tribunals, though they come from all over Mythic Europe. Anyone can join by proving herself in the Great Play, and in fact it is said that even a few members of House Tytalus have set aside their grudge and joined House Merinita through this society.''
''Shadow-Masters enjoy the simulation of reality even more than reality itself, and hold that over time, the fi ction becomes truth. Many swear that the creatures they have created have begun to reproduce, or have been found in places where ShadowMasters have never been. For them, this is the pinnacle of achievement; it shows that their creations have taken on lives of their own, which they believe is ultimately what all faeries truly desire.''

Then, on the date of the manifestation of her Gift, which she must discover if not known (+1), she and her Mystagogue must fi ght a Creo or Muto Imaginem certamen, reciting ritual insults at each attack, until one of them falls unconscious from loss of Fatigue (+1). She also acquires the Major Flaw Vulnerable Magic (+9), which is often associated with the circumstances that caused her Gift to manifest. Participation in the Great Play may be substituted for the duel, though she still gains the Flaw.''

==The Sundered Realms==

''Many Merinitae ponder the relationship between the Magic and Faerie realms, since through their House Mysteries they must often straddle the divide, with one foot on either side. Some seek ways to unite the two, others to further separate them, and a few explore their mystic origins in search of new insights into both.''
''One popular theory within House Merinita is that the four supernatural realms were once only one realm — Faerie — and that Arcadia is the Garden of Eden. Then the serpent tempted Adam and Eve to taste the fruit of knowledge, and their eyes were opened; they received The Gift, but at the cost of their immortality. The one realm became two — Magic and Faerie — and they were all of them sent from the fabulous Garden, exiled to the mortal world where they became subject to Twilight and death.''
''When the angels rebelled against Heaven and fell, they divided the realms into two others: the Divine and Infernal.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''However, at the same time, some of the angels chose to remove themselves from the confl ict, choosing neither God nor Lucifer, and these beings remained separate from Heaven and Hell. Not being entirely human, they traveled freely between earth and Garden; these are the pagan gods and monsters of the ancient world. Thus, it is said, magic is associated with those who possess the knowledge of the Tree of Life — the children of Adam and Eve, the descendents of the serpent, and the named beasts of Eden — while faeries are the others who guard the edges of terrestrial paradise, who because of their otherworldly nature remain outsiders in human society.''

|}
''Other Merinitae suppose that the division between Magic and Faerie is a more recent phenomenon, having occurred at or soon after the birth of Christ. The physical incarnation of God in the human world was too much for''
''most of the pagan gods and ancient heroes to withstand, they say, and caused the Spirit realm from which they originated to divide into two parts: those who returned to earth in natural forms joined the realm of Magic, and those that passed away forever became Faerie. The Merinitae who favor this idea maintain that the ancient gods and goddess remain in Arcadia as ghostly shadows of their former greatness, capable of only limited interaction with the physical world. They also suggest that they could be returned to power via concentrated worship or other human devices.''

===The Cult of Vesta===

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''In the later years of the Roman Empire, many of the pagan cults began to band together, combining the characteristics of many gods into cults nominally''

|}
''associated with only one of them. The original Cult of Mercury was one of these, uniting most of the original pantheon under one god’s name. The rites of Vesta, a relatively minor goddess of hearth and home, were eventually integrated into the practices of Diana, and her cult outlived the Fall of Rome by retreating into the barbaric wilderness outside of the empire, surviving beside the pagan practices of the German invaders. Some believe that Merinita was a high priestess of this struggling Diana cult.''
''After Quendalon transformed the House, a pair of young magae from Brittany began to experiment with combining what they knew of Merinita’s nature magic with the new secrets that Quendalon had taught them. They discovered that the childlike innocence of Faerie could mimic wild and unspoiled nature, even in domesticated areas, so long as there were some among the community who remained chaste.''
''Since faeries can generally adapt to any realm, these magae made it their task to encourage the fae to settle within their lands, and dedicated their cult to that objective. They adopted Vesta as their patron, reasoning that since she, a domestic goddess, had survived in the wilderness as part of the Cult of Diana, perhaps so too could Diana, the goddess of nature, survive in the home as part of the new Cult of Vesta.''
''They resurrected many old Roman rites of the Vestal priestesses, venerating faeries as household gods and encouraging the practice of leaving gifts for them in exchange for their services. They also took vows of chastity, for they believed that their unusual focus would fail if their sexuality were ever “tamed.” Through their Initiation rites, members of the cult gained special powers from the faeries in exchange for this sacrifi ce, but swore that if they ever broke their vows they would be punished — buried alive, to give back to the earth the bounty that they had taken from it.''
''The Vestals do not involve themselves much with the politics of the Order of Hermes at large, though they are known to the Hermetic Cult of Mercury, and might be considered their kindred spirits. While they do not typi''

''On a particular day of the year, the entrance to a faerie regio becomes a trod leading directly to Arcadia, as the characters happen to discover, though they do not recognize the difference at fi rst. They soon discover that in this part of Faerie, all of their custos can work magic, but that the magi have temporarily lost their powers. The characters discover a young woman in an underground cavern, undisturbed for centuries, who appears to be asleep. Her fi nger has been pricked with a pin, which is''
''•''
''•''
''lying nearby and marked with the symbol of the goddess Juno. Players might recognize this variation on the “Sleeping Beauty” myth, and thus fi gure out how to wake the girl. A Merinita archmagus resents the attention given to Roman deities by the Order, and seeks instead to revive the Norse gods of war and destruction worshiped by his ancestors. Is this something with which the characters should interfere? How can they stop one pantheon from regaining strength, while encouraging another?''
''•''

==Society Story Seeds==

''Gods and goddesses of the ancient world can be associated with either the Faerie or Magical realms, though those that have a magical aspect tend to be focused on themselves more than on their worshipers, and many of them are thought to have taken physical forms or retreated far from human society. Those who still seek followers and have an interest in mortal affairs are considered''
''powerful faeries, and it may be diffi cult to distinguish them from other great lords and ladies of the faerie courts. Still, dedicated ceremonies designed to gain their attention and favor could plausibly have an effect, and many pagan Merinitae have claimed to have the blessings of their ancient deities at one time or another.''

==Pagan Glory==

''cally Initiate outsiders into their secrets, they might share insights into Magic or Faerie Lore with them in the hopes of further narrowing the distance between the two realms.''

|}
''Followers of Vesta are traditionally women, though there have been men represented. They usually take Gifted children between the ages of six and ten as apprentices, indoctrinating them with the ideals of the society and Initiating them into Faerie Magic. There are two formal levels of Initiation after the Gauntlet, however, and any Merinita can join if they are willing to dedicate themselves to the cult.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''The fi rst level is the Vestal virgin. A Vestal serves for thirty years, and there are no more than nine Vestals at any given time. When one of them leaves, she or one of her sisters chooses a worthy replacement. The new Vestal Initiates the Nature Lore Mystery with the unique focus of lares (“household spirits,” also called penates); these are essentially a type of domestic faerie associated with the home and community. With Lares Lore, Vestals interact with the faeries of a settlement in the same way that nature magi interact with the denizens of the wilderness.''

|}
''The second level of Initiation comes after thirty years, when the maga leaves the priesthood. She generally settles down in a small village or covenant and gives herself over entirely to its care. She learns either Becoming or Guardian of Nature (she may join her spirit with a Faerie aura so long as she remains a virgin), and uses her powers to transform herself into a sort of civic deity. Within her community she may endure for as long as her faeries fl ourish, guiding the common folk of the area to ensure that the old ways survive.''

She bakes the cake on Vestalia, June 9th, and places it on her hearth to attract the faeries (+1). On the Ides of June (June 15th), the Initiate must then thoroughly clean her dwelling, burning the refuse in the fi re and scattering the ashes into the nearest river (+1). She must then meet the Mystagogue in her clean home. There, she swears to honor the faeries and takes a Vow of chastity (+3), which the faeries covertly witness (+3).''

==Merinita Mysteries==

''This section describes the secrets that defi ne the House, which Merinitae may Initiate in exchange for appropriate sacrifi ce and study. They are broken into schools, groups of Mysteries primarily associated with the magi who introduced them to the House. Merinitae recognize three schools associated with Faerie Magic, and there is also said to be a peripheral school about which little is generally known. Characters raised in the House usually belong to a lineage associated with one of these schools, Initiating the Mysteries from their parentes. Those who join the House after apprenticeship usually enter the Mysteries through Initiation into a group of like-minded Merinitae instead (see above).''
''Initiating a person into a Mystery is much like taking an apprentice, and formally joining House Merinita is considered a necessary part of the process. They maintain that if you have Initiated the Outer Mystery, you belong to their House. This implied threat doesn’t carry much weight, since on the whole Merinitae are not very aggressive or even politically active. Still, all of them know that they should formally introduce potential Initiates to the House''
''before teaching them their secrets, and that there should be consequences for those who indiscriminately share their Mysteries with outsiders.''
''Below are some of the more common kinds of magic within the House; many of these are Virtues available to all characters during character creation, which Merinitae often Initiate later through their Mystery rites. Most are referenced by the lineages that are found throughout this section. A few are even appropriate for companions without The Gift who share the House’s interest in the fae and faerie things.''

==New Virtues==

''These Virtues explore the supernatural and Hermetic differences that make followers of Merinita unusual, especially where the Faerie or Magic realms overlap, or where characters are extraordinarily inspired by otherworldly ideas and places.''

===Alluring To (Beings)===

''Minor, General This Virtue is associated with one of three classes of beings: mundane animals, faeries, or magical beings. These last two include characters associated with Faerie or the Magic realms, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Faerie or Magic Might.''
''These beings are strangely drawn to the character, and generally trust or obey her without thinking. She gets +3 on Communication and Presence rolls to affect them. Characters who are Offensive to beings of this sort cannot take this Virtue, including those who have The Gift or Magical Air, though characters who are Inoffensive to them or have the Gentle Gift may.''
''Note that while Alluring to Magical Beings can affect Hermetic magi, the Parma Magica protects against this effect as part of resisting the social penalties of The Gift. Might and other forms of general Magic Resistance do not hinder this effect.''

===Enchanting (Ability)===

''Minor, Supernatural Like Enchanting Music (ArM5, page 65), this Supernatural Ability applies to a particular type of artistic expression:''
''dance, drawing, storytelling, even craftwork. Those with this Virtue may fi nd that in Faerie auras this Ability allows them to change or control events based on how well they depict them with their art.''

===Faerie-raised Magic===

''Major, Hermetic The character’s experience with faeries and the Faerie realm has conditioned him to invent spells very quickly; to him, formulaic spells seem like inherent powers that you can learn through observation and experimentation. Because of this, he can teach himself spells outside of the laboratory. You may spend experience points from Exposure, Adventure, and Practice on spells that mimic faerie powers or other supernatural effects your character has observed that season.''
''To invent a spell in this way, the magus’s Technique + Form + Intelligence + Magic Theory must at least equal (the spell’s level – 10), and you must spend a number of experience points equal to (the spell magnitude + 4). Spells of level 5 or less cost their level in experience points (but always at least 1). For example, a level 2 spell costs 2 experience points, and a Level 15 spell costs 7 experience points. The magus cannot invent Ritual spells in this way.''
''If the magus already knows a spell that is similar to one he wishes to invent (see Similar Spells, ArM5 page 101), any experience points you spend towards learning that spell are increased by onehalf. This means that a level 25 spell would cost 6 experience points instead of 9, for example.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''This Virtue also includes Spell Improvisation (see below). That is, you may add the magnitude of a known formulaic spell as a bonus to your character’s Casting Total when spontaneously casting a spell that is similar to it.''

|}
''If you take this Virtue during character creation, you should also take the Faerie Upbringing Flaw. Because the magus’s master also had to teach him about human society, he probably had less time to teach him Hermetic magic. It is possible that the apprentice invented formulaic spells quickly enough on his own to compensate for this, but you might take the Weak Parens Flaw to suggest this limitation of his apprenticeship.''

===Independent Study===

''Minor, General The character develops new skills extremely quickly on his own. When he is studying through Practice, add two to the Source Quality, and add three to the Source Quality of his Adventure experience.''

===Inoffensive To (Beings)===

''Minor, General This Virtue is associated with one of three classes of beings: mundane animals, faeries, or magical beings. These last two include characters associated with Faerie or the Magic realms, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Faerie or Magic Might.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''The character’s Gift does not bother beings of this sort, although it still has the normal effects on others. For example, Inoffensive to Animals makes it easier for her to get along with mundane beasts. Animals who react positively to The Gift still react positively to her, since she does have The Gift, but those that do not are not disturbed by her presence.''
''You may not take this Virtue more than once; characters who are Inoffensive to more than one type of being should''

''Minor, Hermetic The magus may add the magnitude of a formulaic spell he knows as a bonus to his Casting Total when spontaneously casting a spell that is similar to it (see Similar Spells, ArM5 page 101). This includes fast-casting a spell that is the same as or very similar to one of his formulaic spells, though he does not get this bonus if he has the Fast Cast Ability for a mastered spell, since in that case you add his Mastery Ability instead. This bonus does not stack with other bonuses to his Casting Total, nor does it stack with itself if the magus happens to know several similar spells.''

===Harmless Magic===

''Minor, Hermetic The character’s Perdo spells cannot permanently destroy anything; they temporarily disrupt the target, like Perdo Imaginem magic, but as soon as the duration has passed the target returns to its natural state as if nothing had happened, like a Muto effect. This means that a version of The Wound that Weeps (PeCo15), for example, briefl y causes a painful, bleeding wound that immediately closes again. Likewise, Fist of Shattering (PeTe10) causes an object of stone or weaker material to briefl y break apart, but then''
''fuse itself together again. The character’s Ritual Perdo spells function normally, however.''
''This weakness can be a boon to a crafty character. A maga might invent a spell to destroy a heavy rock at Concentration Duration; she could then cast it and lie in wait. When her enemy walks into the vacant space, she could release her concentration and crush her victim beneath it when it reforms. However, in most cases this limitation is a minor hindrance, as useful Perdo magic requires longer Durations.''

===Inconstant Magic===

''Minor, Hermetic The character’s magic is easily distracted, it stutters and starts. Spells that require his guidance (e.g. concentration, or aimed spells) after being cast are not immediately responsive, as if the character must focus the spell’s attention, and spells that are triggered by a condition (such as Waiting Spells or enchanted devices) take about two minutes to activate, as if the magic had wandered off when the caster was not watching it carefully. Any magic items he creates with constant effects are interrupted at sunrise and sunset; the magic is not seamless. The character suffers a –3 penalty to all Finesse rolls.''

===Offensive To (Beings)===

''Minor, General This Flaw is associated with one of three classes of beings: mundane humans, demons, or divine beings. These last two include characters associated with the Divine or the Infernal realm, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Divine or Infernal Might.''
''Beings of the chosen category react badly to the character, as if he had The Gift, which makes them very uncomfortable around him and gives him a –3 to all social interaction rolls with them.''
''You may not take this Flaw more than once; characters who are Offensive to more than one kind of being should take Magical Air instead. Characters with The Gift may take this Flaw only if they have the Gentle Gift, which makes this type of being react to them negatively while others are unaffected.''

===Unbearable To (Beings)===

''Minor, General This Flaw is associated with one of three classes of beings: mundane humans, demons, or divine beings. These last two include characters associated with the Divine or the Infernal realms, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Divine or Infernal Might.''
''These beings are extremely disturbed, frightened, and possibly enraged by the character’s presence. She suffers an additional –3 penalty on all social interactions with them, which adds to the –3 penalty normally associated with The Gift. Only characters with The Gift or Magical Air may take this Flaw, and it cannot be combined with the Blatant Gift.''
''The Flaw is sometimes known by different names among Merinitae, depending on the type of being it affects. Offensive to Humans is called “The Tin Gift”; Offensive to Infernal Beings is called “The Iron Gift”; and Offensive to Divine Beings is called “The Leaden Gift.” These Flaws are thought to balance the similar Inoffensive Virtues; it is very common for characters with one of the positive versions of The Gift to have one of these negative versions as well.''
''You may not take this Flaw more than once; characters who are Unbearable to more than one kind of being should take the Blatant Gift instead.''

===Unnatural Magic===

''Major, Hermetic Because of the unreal and illusory nature of your magic, none of the character’s Creo rituals have a permanent effect. Wounds magically closed with The Chirurgeon’s Healing Touch (CrCo20), for example, reopen again as soon as he fi nishes casting the spell, as the magic truly lasts only a moment. He also cannot extract vis from an aura using Creo, since his version of that Art is too unstable for it to remain in a lasting physical form.''

===Vulnerable Magic===

''Major, Hermetic The character’s magic is automatically dispelled in certain uncommon circumstances. Examples include: when touching''
''iron, when under the infl uence of the Divine, when crossing over running water, when his name is spoken three times, or when he is not touching the ground. This condition immediately ends the duration of a spell when it is applied to the target, or all of your active spells when applied to you.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"

''This Flaw may be taken multiple times, so long as a different condition is specifi ed for each.''

==New Abilities==

''These Abilities are only taught to magi who have Initiated the Mysteries of House Merinita.''

===Faerie Magic===


|}
''Faerie Magic is an Arcane Ability learned after Merinitae Initiate the Outer Mystery of Faerie Magic (see ArM5, page 92), which represents how their magic differs from normal Hermetic magic. This includes the ability to apply faerie thinking to arcane activities, usually by drawing out sympathetic connections between magical and mundane things.''
''These mystic relationships may be integrated into casting tools that Merinitae often use with their spells, called charms (see sidebar). These are symbolic representations designed to highlight a particular quality of the target that always involve some sort of artistic ability. They may be used to increase Penetration, but are also used with many of the Inner Mysteries to produce other interesting effects.''
''Merinitae can integrate the principles of charms into their laboratory activities, making use of their knowledge of symbols associated with the Faerie and Magic realms in their work, and this is represented by three additional effects of the Faerie Magic Ability:''
''Faerie Magic may be substituted for Magic Theory when experimenting, when using faerie vis, or when practicing magic associated with the Faerie realm. The amount of vis you can use in a single season is equal to your (Magic Theory + Faerie Magic) x 2, so long as all of it is faerie vis. Add your score in Faerie Magic to the number of botch dice you roll in these conditions, but the effects''

''of these additional dice tend to be more annoying than dangerous; it takes two of these botches to produce the negative effects of a normal botch die. The character still gains a Warping Point for each 0 rolled on these extra dice, though they do not force you to check for Twilight. (This is because integrating faerie power into magic warps the character more quickly, but does not increase her chances of being overcome by it.) Two or more botches on the standard botch dice require a check for Twilight as normal, however.''
''Faerie Magic might also represent the union of Faerie Lore and Magic Lore, the knowledge of similarities between the two realms. Often this combination can inspire surprising insights, especially when dealing with entities traditionally associated with both realms, like pagan gods, ghosts, and chimerae. It is also an appropriate Ability to use when trying to distinguish between Magic and Faerie, as it can address differences between the two realms.''
''Specialties: faerie vis, experimenting, inventing spells, charms, lore (Arcane)''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|

===House Merinita Lore===


|}
''This is the Ability that Merinitae use to Initiate their House Mysteries, and thus it is the one thing that they all have in common. It represents knowledge of all the secret rites, mysteries, and legends associated with the House, including all three schools of Faerie Magic Mysteries, and even the nature Mysteries taught by Merinita to her followers before she disappeared. Magi who wish to Initiate the Inner Mysteries should have at least a score of 1, and Mystagogues of the many different House cults typically have scores of 4 or 5.''
''Specialties: Initiating others, Initiating self, modifying an Initiation Script (Arcane)''

==Familiars==

''Merinita introduced the ritual that allows a maga to bond with her familiar,''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Charms are casting aids that all magi who study Faerie Magic learn how to make, which identify a specifi c magical effect using sympathetic magic. They can be physical objects, like sculptures or drawings; or performances, like songs or stories; or even arcane pronouncements or ceremonies, like prophecy or naming.''
''A temporary charm takes about ten minutes to design, and must be used right away, typically with spontaneous magic. More lasting charms, or permanent charms, take several hours, and must involve a special object that the maga wields when she activates the charm, incorporating the object into the effect; if this object is damaged, the charm must be remade.''
''A maga who has a score in Faerie Magic and an Arcane Connection to her target may use a charm as a''
''sympathetic representation, increasing her Penetration multiplier by two. This requires a roll when the charm is made: composing a song might use Communication + Music, while a drawing might be Dexterity + Craft. The maga produces an effective charm on a roll of six or more, or nine or more for a permanent charm. Other magi can do this without Faerie Magic, but it takes them longer and they need a higher total on the roll (see Sympathetic Connections, ArM5 page 84).''
''Temporary charms may only be used once, as they always include unique properties associated with the effect, though a permanent charm associated with a special object may be used whenever it is applicable. A maga may prepare any number of charms in advance, but may only incorporate one charm into a given spell in this way.''

==Charms==

''and many of her followers have developed a special affi nity for them. In fact, within the House it is far more respected to take a familiar than it is to train an apprentice, and those who do the latter before the former tend to be looked down upon by their peers. Merinitae who are interested in this direction might take a Major Magical Focus with Familiars, which applies to all spells and laboratory activities that affect familiars, either their own or those belonging to other magi.''

===Enchanting a Faerie Familiar===

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''If a character has been Initiated into the Outer Mystery of Faerie Magic, she may bind as a familiar any living thing that is inherently faerie by nature. This is almost always represented by having a Faerie Might score, though it can also apply to people and animals that have become fay by close association with the Faerie realm. The being must be somehow attuned to the maga in order for the enchantment to succeed, exactly the same as with magical beasts, requiring mutual admiration and a compatible nature. The character then enchants the faerie as normal, using the Familiar Bonding Lab Total (ArM5, page 104).''

|}
''There are three special powers inherent in the enchantment of a faerie familiar. These are:''
''sHared PoWers: The maga may activate any of the familiar’s powers as if she possessed them herself, much like casting formulaic spells, by using her Fatigue Levels in place of Might. Each Fatigue Level she spends is worth a number of Might Points equal to (familiar’s Might Score / 5). Thus, if her familiar had a Might Score of 10, the maga could spend a Fatigue Level as if it were 2 Might Points.  Faeries do not have Fatigue Levels, but the familiar may expend the same number of Might Points as if it were a Fatigue Level, allowing it to exert itself in combat. sHared senses: The maga can tell when the familiar perceives something with its faerie senses that she cannot, or when she can see some''

===•===

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|

===•===


|}
''thing that her familiar cannot. Since most faeries have Second Sight, this is often useful information, and the familiar receives the same insight. This gives each of the couple at least a general idea of the direction and distance to the irregularity. sHared fatigue: The familiar may regain (its Might Score / 5) Might Points by resting, just as the maga regain Fatigue Levels. For example, if a familiar with Might Score 10 had spent 2 Might Points, it could regain both of them by resting for two minutes. If it were down 4 Might Points, it would take it ten minutes of resting to regain the fi rst two points, then two minutes more for the last.  The familiar may also spend Might Points when the maga would lose a Fatigue Level, allowing her to draw upon its tirelessness instead of expending her own energy. This costs it a number of Might Points equal to the value of the Fatigue Level the maga would reach, with each Level worth (familiar’s Might Score / 5). Thus, for a familiar with Might 10 to give the maga a Fatigue Level when she is Fresh would cost it 2 Might Points, Winded would cost 4, Weary 6, and so on.''
''The three cords still function as normal, but as it is part of the nature of faeries to chafe against bindings, the cords grow weaker over time (unless they are reinforced by the faerie cords described below). Every year one of them degrades, usually the one with the highest value. This is handled in a manner similar to the way Characteristics are affected by aging, so that each year one of the cords receives an Aging Point. After four years of Aging, a +3 cord would become +2, three years later it would become +1, and after two more years it would be 0. If all three cords have scores of 0, the bond degrades completely at the end of the year and the enchantment is broken. The faerie is released, and all powers that have been invested into the bond are lost.''
''Followers of Merinita have always been disappointed by this limitation of faerie familiars, but they have decided that it is part of the nature of Faerie, and''

===•===

''have come to accept it. Because of this, many members of the House advocate not becoming too deeply attached to their familiars, and in fact recommend avoid lasting personal commitments in general. Deep, abiding relationships cannot be forged with the faeries, they warn, and so they suggest that magi take an interesting succession of temporary faerie familiars instead, experiencing a wide variety of companions throughout their lifetimes.''
''Other Merinitae are troubled by this practice, especially as it seems to be the exact opposite of what their Founder believed, and distorts the whole purpose of her enchantment. Thus, many of them do not take faerie familiars at all, preferring to bind a magical animal for life using the standard method that has been integrated into Hermetic magic theory. It is also generally held that Merinitae who are extremely fay in personality should bind magical familiars, not faerie ones, to help balance their two natures, and so there is no stigma associated with this choice — in fact, a Merinita maga might even bind a magical familiar simply to increase her reputation as faerielike.''

===The Three Faerie Cords===

''In the late 1000s, a maga named Farrago Bonisagi discovered a solution to the dilemma of faerie familiars. She belonged to House Bonisagus, but she was very interested in integrating faerie powers with Hermetic magic theory, and she Initiated the Mystery of Faerie Magic many years after swearing the Oath, joining House Merinita to further her research. Her earliest project involved trying to fi nd a way to learn faerie powers from a faerie familiar, Initiating them through the bond, but she was entirely unsuccessful at this, and she attributed her failure to the temporary nature of the enchantment. Soon she became obsessed with discovering a way to permanently bind herself to a faerie.''
''Her studies led her to investigate cryptic comments attributed to Merinita, about additional cords in the familiar enchantment. She could not fi nd a description of these cords, but she theorized that they were somehow connected to the''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''others, and after many years of experimentation she was able to isolate three of them. She called these the leaden cord, the iron cord, and the tin cord, and she documented her discoveries well, so that anyone Initiated into Faerie Magic could take advantage of them. She also believed that there was at least one more cord still to be identifi ed, but she did not speculate what it could do.''

|}
''These three cords have negative effects, rather than positive. They hinder the maga’s mind, body, and spirit in certain circumstances, offsetting the benefi ts of the other cords and making her more''
''vulnerable. This is because they do not bring the maga and her familiar closer together, but rather bind the familiar more securely to the maga, preventing its faerie nature from eroding the cords that connect them. In a sense, these negative cords strengthen the positive cords, while at the same time limiting their power.''
''The cords are purchased exactly the same way as the others, by dividing the maga’s Lab Total for a season into points that are allocated among them. The cords serve to balance each other, and so long as the sum of the values of one set of cords does not exceed the sum of the scores for''
''the other, the cords do not degrade, and the maga does not need to apply Aging Points to them. This means that one negative cord increased to +3 can offset three positive cords at +1, or vice-versa. If there is a discrepancy, the highest-value cord on the side with the greater total, negative or positive, will receive an Aging Point each year as normal.''
''Mirroring the positive cords, each negative cord also has a varying effect that penalizes both the maga and her familiar.''
''tHe leaden cord: The maga is more susceptible to the Divine, and more prone to magical errors in its presence; add the value of this cord to the number of botch dice you must roll when the maga uses her powers in the Dominion or when touching a holy object. You must also subtract this score from her attempts to resist Divine infl uence, including Personality Trait and natural resistance rolls. tHe iron cord: The maga cannot stand the feel of iron. When she is touching it, you must apply the value of this cord as a penalty to all of her rolls, and subtract it from her Soak when she is hit with iron weapons. She is also much more susceptible to the Infernal realm, and must increase the number of botch dice you roll by this amount when she uses her powers in an Infernal aura. tHe tin cord: The maga is more vulnerable outside of supernatural auras, and being cut off from a mystic realm makes her very nervous and uncomfortable. When she is not within a supernatural aura of some sort, you must subtract the value of this cord from all of her Personality Trait rolls, natural resistance rolls, healing rolls, rolls to withstand deprivation, and Aging rolls. You also subtract this value from her Soak.''
''Faeries bound with these negative cords often come to resent their masters, and begin to feel a terrible yearning to escape. It is against the nature of the fae to be fettered; if the bonds do not degrade naturally, the familiar begins to desire freedom more powerfully than anything''

''One of Merinita’s fi rst apprentices who later joined Quendalon, a maga named Alsia, developed a spell that allowed those with Faerie Magic to approximate binding a familiar, though of course the effect is only temporary. This unusual application quickly spread throughout the House, and it is particularly appreciated by those who favor taking many different familiars. Thus, it may be invented by anyone who has been Initiated into the Outer Mystery of Faerie Magic, and since it is old and popular, there are likely to be Lab Texts of it found in Hermetic libraries throughout Mythic Europe.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''The idea of the spell is surprisingly acceptable within the House, as it is a common bargain for faeries to agree to serve a maga for a specifi c length of time, and this effect helps enforce the arrangement. It is the maga’s responsibility to care for her slave, while it is expected to serve its master and do what she tells it to do. Those who abuse their familiars lose respect in the House, and may even fi nd that some of their sodales are willing to help faerie slaves escape the terms of their service.''

===Faerie Chains of the Familiar Slave===

''CrVi Gen R: Touch, D: Until, T: Ind, Ritual Requisites: see below This ritual binds a supernatural creature to the caster as her familiar, until a condition incorporated into the''

|}
''spell comes to pass. The level of the ritual must be no less than (the creature’s Might + 15), though she may also need to penetrate its Magic Resistance if casting on an unwilling target. It has no effect if the target is already bound as a familiar to another.''
''Casting requisites of a Technique and Form appropriate to the creature’s nature and physical form may be included. These two Arts are used to determine the Lab Total for any subsequent improvements to the bond. The cords connecting maga and familiar have initial values of 0, and the vis cost of this ritual does not apply towards these improvements. The maga can strengthen the bond in the lab, but the effect is still inherently temporary. If she casts this on a faerie, she gains the three special powers (Shared Powers, Shared Senses, and Shared Fatigue) associated with a faerie familiar, but the cords will decay as normal, though the bond is never completely broken so long as the spell’s duration remains in effect.''
''Because the bond is often made under duress, the familiar is much more wild and independent than normal familiars, and typically must be subdued or guarded to ensure it does not try to escape. The two are probably at odds most of the time, and the faerie is likely to bear a grudge against the maga afterward if it is taken advantage of or treated badly.''
''(Base effect, +1 Touch, +4 Until)''

==Temporary Familiars==

''else, and becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the arrangement. Some faerie familiars commit suicide to break away from their bonds, while others choose to act out in strange and spiteful ways, and some simply bear their imprisonment in quiet despair.''

===Binding the Gift (Minor House Mystery)===


|}
''Merinita knew how to unlock an additional property of the cords that bind a maga to her familiar: she learned how to share the supernatural quality of her Gift that affects social relations with others, and in so doing could moderate some of the penalties. This is said to have helped her overcome her legendary shyness. She taught this secret to many of her followers, including some who later joined Quendalon, and thus it is still taught in her House.''
''After Initiating this Mystery, the magus’s familiar is affl icted with the same social penalties that the magus himself suffers because of The Gift — most people and animals can sense that there is something different about the familiar, and are made uncomfortable by its presence. If the magus has the Gentle Gift, or if his Gift is inoffensive to a specifi c kind of being, his familiar is similarly protected by these Virtues. If he has the Blatant Gift, or is otherwise offensive to some, his familiar also inherits these Flaws.''
''The three cords that bind the magus and his familiar also serve to lessen the penalties for both of them, and as they become closer to each other they can even overcome them altogether and become more alluring to certain kinds of people or creatures. The familiar acts as a soothing infl uence on the magus’s Gift, and helps to put other beings with similar backgrounds at ease. Each cord thus has an additional effect, as described below.''
''tHe golden gift: The storyguide should add the value of the golden cord to social rolls that involve interactions with all magical beings, meaning those that have a Magical Might score or who have a supernatural background associated with''

===•===

''the Magic realm. This includes Hermetic magi, though they are usually immune to social effects of The Gift because of the Parma Magica. tHe silver gift: This strengthens the magus’s relationship with faeries and faerie creatures. Add the value of the silver cord to all social rolls involving people and creatures with Faerie Might, or who have a supernatural background associated with the fae. Magi with Faerie Virtues and Flaws are included in this category, but again they are usually shielded from the effect by the Parma Magica. tHe BronZe gift: The magus’s Gift is less aggravating to mundane animals; the storyguide should add the value of the bronze cord to all rolls that deal with social interactions with them. Some animals — usually those with a supernatural nature — do not react negatively to The Gift, and in that case this cord does not improve the magus’s relations with them, since there is no penalty for the cord to offset.''
''Bonding with a faerie familiar usually involves forging three additional cords, as described above, and these cords are also negatively affected by this Virtue. The value of the cord is added to the penalty for having The Gift, making the magus and his familiar even more despised in certain circumstances related to the cord.''
''tHe leaden cord: The magus becomes less alluring in the Dominion, and Divine beings or people associated with the Divine realm are made more uncomfortable by his presence. The storyguide should subtract the value of the leaden cord from all social rolls made under these conditions, including whenever the magus is touching anything that is associated with the Divine realm. tHe iron cord: The Infernal realm brings out negative qualities in the magus and his familiar, enhancing the discomfort caused by his Gift. Subtract the value of the iron cord from all social rolls you make in Infernal auras, when dealing with''

''beings who have Infernal Might or an Infernal background, or when touching things that are tainted with evil. The magus is also similarly penalized whenever he is touching iron. tHe tin cord: The magus’s Gift is particularly aggravating to normal people, those who do not have any sort of supernatural background at all. The storyguide should subtract the value of the tin cord from all of his social rolls governing mundane human interaction.''
''In circumstances where more than one cord applies, use the one with the greater value. For example, when interacting with a person who has both faerie and magical aspects, apply either The Golden Gift or The Silver Gift, whichever is stronger. If both a positive and negative cord apply, use both, adding the bonus and subtracting the penalty.''
''This Mystery is considered a strange artifact of the House from before Quendalon, and most of the established Initiation Scripts for it are very natureoriented, often involving Ordeals where the magus must live in the wilderness or on the fringes of society for a time.''

==Arcadian Mysteries==

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''These are the Mysteries that were allegedly discovered by Quendalon, and which were responsible for the dramatic change in focus for his House. They concern faeries and the Faerie realm, making it possible for magi to travel through Faerie, summon faeries from Arcadia into the physical world, and to actually become faeries themselves.''

===Arcadian Travel (Minor Arcadian Mystery)===


|}
''This Mystery allows the maga to travel between Faerie and the mortal world with relative ease, via special pathways called trods. Trods are roads that lead into and out of Faerie; they are what connect the different levels of regiones to each other and to the mundane world,''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|

===•===


|}
''and can even lead to Arcadia. These paths occasionally occur naturally, as those who are familiar with regiones know, but with this secret magic Merinitae can cause them to appear at will.''
''Opening a trod requires that the maga fi rst design a charm (see above) that depicts the trod’s destination. It is possible to create a charm for a place to which she has never been — the Ease Factor is 12 for a mundane place, 15 for a regio level, and 18 if the destination is part of Arcadia. Note that while human beings can make trods to visit fantastic places they can only imagine, faeries cannot; they can only travel to places they know.''
''Once she has an appropriate charm, the maga must concentrate upon it; she must be able to perceive the charm, and if it was made in advance, she must touch the object associated with it. This process usually takes about ten minutes, though if she is designing the charm on the spot, she can combine this time with the time it takes to make it. Then the maga must roll her scores in Perception + the Ability used to make the charm.''

===Arcadian Travel Total: Stress Die +===


===Perception + (Ability) + Aura===

''A mundane destination can only be reached by fi rst traveling to a level of a regio above it, and the more removed from reality the destination, the more diffi cult it is to open the trod, as shown in the following chart. However, if the maga has an Arcane Connection to the trod’s destination, she may subtract 6 from the Ease Factor. For the purposes of evaluating the modifi er for a supernatural aura, you may treat this as either a Faerie or Magical power, taking the more benefi cial effect.''

===Destination Ease Factor===

''Regio Level destination level x 3''
''Leave Regio current level of regio x 3''
''Arcadia (13 – current aura modifi er) x 3''

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"

''Besides the maga, a trod can affect a number of other people equal to her''

|}
''Faerie Magic score, so long as they all participate in the activation of the charm, concentrating upon it as the maga does. While they are immersed in the experience, the maga leads them through the trod, and they immediately appear at its destination beside the maga. It is impossible for a person to enter a trod unwillingly, though it might happen unwittingly.''

===Animae Magic (Major Arcadian Mystery)===

''This Mystery allows the maga to bring out faerie properties of everyday things, transforming inanimate objects into living beings and producing faerie creatures at will. These temporary faeries are called animae, “artifi cial souls.” This includes a number of new spell guidelines that only magi with this Virtue can use, described below.''
''Animae are essentially alive, and like most faeries they are intelligent and can interact with their environment. They often have powers appropriate to their Might, and while they are not necessarily friendly, they are usually willing to bargain with the maga for their aid. In exchange for such mortal pleasures as a full wineskin, roasted meat, or a kiss, they might fi ght for the maga, scout out the area, carry her over obstacles, or ensure a good harvest.''
''While they usually resemble humans and can often be affected by Corpus and Mentem spells, animae are also part of the Form appropriate to their nature, and magi may use that Form to target them in the same way that they would use Animal to affect beasts. Thus, animae can be warded away by Rego effects of this Form, but note that they can appear inside an Aegis of the Hearth if summoned from within its boundaries.''
''Merinitae often argue about the origins of animae. Some say they are simply a sleeping aspect of nature brought forth by Faerie Magic. Others say that a faerie spirit is summoned from Arcadia to animate the target. Some think that the magic actually creates a new faerie from the caster’s belief. No one knows for sure if any of these theories are correct, though.''

===Becoming (Major Arcadian Mystery)===


|}
''This Mystery teaches the maga how to become a faerie, as Quendalon was reputed to have done (though some secretly think it actually destroys the maga and summons a faerie to take her place). It is an irreversible process with many strange effects, both benefi cial and otherwise, and the character must be prepared to undergo dramatic changes to her magic and her being that alter her very nature.''

''There are three primary transformation rituals associated with Becoming, each one changing a different part of the maga: her body, her mind, and her spirit. This is done through a special kind of laboratory activity that only Merinitae who have Initiated this Mystery can attempt. The maga must perform all three rituals to become entirely fay, in any order, and each requires a season of effort, wherein the maga’s Lab Total must equal or exceed the level of the ritual.''

|}
''The Technique and Form used determine what sort of faerie the maga becomes, and these may differ for each part of the enchantment: Transformation of the Body changes her appearance, Transformation of the Mind changes her personality, and Transformation of the Spirit changes her magic. After the enchantments are fi nished, the maga fi nds her being fundamentally altered to conform to these Arts. For example, Creo Ignem might cause her to look younger and swarthier, Intellego Animal might make her more prone to act on her instincts and curiousity, and Perdo Auram might associate her Might with the destructive properties of the weather.''
''Each transformation ritual has its own criteria for determining the level of the effect, but until she has a Might Score, the maga’s Lab Total cannot exceed her Warping Score multiplied by her Faerie Magic score. Prior to that time, she must use the lesser of the two formulas as her total. After her Transformation of the Spirit, she no longer has this limitation. For this reason, Merinitae often devote themselves to magical experiments and adventures that cause them to gain more Warping Points before performing these rituals.''

===Score X Faerie Magic===


|}
''Like Initiating Mysteries, all of these transformation rituals are affected by Ordeals, either from previous Initiations or undertaken during the season of the transformation. Multiply the appropriate bonus for the Ordeal by fi ve, and subtract it from the required level of the enchantment. For example, gaining a Major Flaw during a ritual would reduce the level of the fi rst enchantment by 45, the next by 30, and the next by 15. This also counts as having Initiated a Mystery when applying that Ordeal to subsequent Mystery Initiations or rituals.''

===Ordeal Modifier: Level – (Initiation===

''Transforming the Body: The maga does not age and never suffers Fatigue. She no longer has Fatigue Levels, and cannot exert herself as others do, either in combat or to cast spontaneous spells, though she may simulate this exertion by spending a Confi dence Point. As part of the enchantment, her apparent age and appearance become fi xed on the cusp of two different phases of life: this is usually either her youth, right after puberty; or adulthood, when her hair fi rst begins to turn gray; or old age, when her hair has become completely white. The level of the enchantment is the character’s true age (the number of years that have passed since she was born) minus 35, plus fi ve times her Decrepitude Score.''

===Transforming the Body: (character’s===


===Age – 35) + (5 X Decrepitude Score)===

''Transforming the Mind: The maga needs no sleep. This means she has two additional free seasons each year, though she cannot perform laboratory activities during them. She can study or adventure, however, and can save up her extra time for the beginning or end of a season, so that she may fi nish lab projects in two months instead of three, and may spend up to sixteen days away from the lab with no penalty. However, she cannot learn any new Abilities ever again — she can improve Abilities she already possesses,''
''but she cannot gain new ones — and she cannot invent spells or magical effects that are not at least similar to spells she already knows (see Similar Spells, ArM5 page 101). This limits her spontaneous magic and her laboratory inventions, though she can still master the spells she has learned. The level for this enchantment is the total of her scores in all of her Abilities.''

===Transforming the Mind: Total Score===

''Transforming the Spirit: The maga sacrifi ces The Gift and becomes a faerie creature. This makes her immune to Warping and gives her Faerie Might, which she may use for Magic Resistance and Penetration. She may still cast spells and perform laboratory activities, but doing so costs her one Might Point for each magnitude of the effect. She is also affected by wards like Aegis of the Hearth and other powers that affect faeries. The level of this enchantment is the total of her scores in all of her Arts, and once it is completed she gains a Might Score equal to half her Becoming Lab Total.''

==Becoming and Familiars==

''When a maga becomes a faerie, she is affected by Merinita’s enchantment in exactly the same way as a faerie. The cords begin to feel like heavy chains, and the bond becomes a hateful form of oppression by her familiar. Unless she has forged the balancing negative cords, the connection between them decays as normal, even if both of them are faeries. Some Merinitae theorize that there must be another ritual to transform the magical cords into faerie cords, which could allow two faeries bonded together to suffer no ill effects, but if that is possible it has not yet been discovered.''

|}
''Animae spells are Creo or Muto. A Muto spell transforms a mundane thing into a faerie, usually something appropriate to its nature, while Creo simply summons a faerie associated with the Form, and the maga has very little control over what. Since all faeries have Might, and since their Might is added to the level of the spell, Animae spells must always be designed at a level greater than that given in the guidelines. For example, to summon a faerie insect with a Might Score of 1 is a base level 11 Creo Animal effect, and to change a pool of water into a water faerie with Might 10 requires an effect of base level 20.''

===Animal===

''Faerie animals are just like mundane animals, except that they can usually talk, walk like people, and often have other human qualities. Animals or animal products changed into animae usually retain beastlike properties, though they are still intelligent. For example, a goat changed into a faerie would be hairy, with horns and goat’s feet, and appropriately goatlike Personality traits; a fish might become a mermaid or some other sort of part-human, part–sea creature.''
''Creo Animal Level 10: Create a faerie insect. Level 15: Create a faerie bird, reptile,''
''fish, or amphibian. Level 20: Create a faerie mammal. Level 25: Create a faerie with animal''
''parts, like wings or gills. Create a faerie that is a combination of multiple animals.''
''Muto Animal Level 10: Change an animal into a''
''faerie. Level 15: Change something made of''
''animal products into a faerie. Level 20: Change something made of''
''multiple animals or animal products into a faerie.''

===Aquam===

''Water faeries can be capricious, but are often deep and unfathomable. They have powerful desires, and can be incredibly destructive when unleashed.''
''Creo Aquam Level 10: Create a water faerie.''
''Muto Aquam Level 5: Change liquid into a faerie.''

===Auram===

''Faeries of the air are typically sanguine and flighty, though note that they are also associated with thunderstorms, wind, and lightning.''
''Creo Auram Level 10: Create a faerie of the air.''
''Muto Auram Level 5:	 Change a weather phenomenon''
''into a faerie.''

===Corpus===

''Faeries of the body may appear human, but are definitely not. They are usually deformed in some way. It is''
''impossible to change a living person into a faerie with Animae Magic.''
''Creo Corpus Level 10: Create an obviously nonhu''
''man faerie (a walking skeleton, a head without a body). Level 15: Create a faerie that appears''
''basically human (a corpse, a hunchback).''
''Muto Corpus Level 15: Change a skeleton, corpse, or''
''other human remains into a faerie. Level 20: Animate human remains in an''
''unusual shape, or a combination of multiple bodies. Level 25: Combine human and ani''
''mal remains into a faerie (Animal requisite).''

===Herbam===

''Faeries of the wood are probably the most well-known faeries in Mythic Europe. They generally behave very similarly to trees whose consciousness has been awakened.''
''Creo Herbam Level 5:	 Create a faerie of the wood.''
''Muto Herbam Level 4:	 Change a plant or item made''
''from plant products into a faerie.''

===Ignem===

''Light, flame, and heat are properties all fire faeries share. While Ignem also covers darkness and the absence of heat, faeries of coldness or ice are typically''

==Animae Guidelines==

''produced with Aquam or Terram spells, and faeries of shadow are considered part of Imaginem.''
''Creo Ignem Level 15: Create a faerie of fire, heat,''
''or light.''
''Muto Ignem Level 10: Change fire, heat, or light into''
''a faerie.''

===Imaginem===

''Animate images do not usually gain additional properties outside their idiom; for example, a faerie echo can only repeat what she hears, and an animate portrait cannot leave her frame. An illusory copy of a person may look and sound like the original but does not necessarily inherit her memories or knowledge. Two notable exceptions are reflections and shadows: when changed into faeries, since they remain tied to their originator and only appear under certain conditions (in mirrors or light), they often retain a part of their source’s identity, and know things that only the original would know otherwise.''
''Creo Imaginem Level 3:	 Create an illusory faerie that''
''can affect one sense. Additional senses add one magnitude each.''
''Muto Imaginem Level 3:	 Change an image that affects''
''one sense into a faerie. Each additional sense the original image affects, or each additional sense that the faerie image can affect (giving a portrait a''
''voice, for example), adds one magnitude to this effect.''

===Mentem===

''Mentem faeries are dangerous to experiment with as they live in the mind and can sometimes take it over. They are typically associated with stories and the imagination, and their host might find herself thinking about friends no one else sees, or interacting with these creatures in dreams.''
''Creo Mentem Level 10: Create a faerie in a person’s''
''mind. Level 15: Create a faerie ghost.''
''Muto Mentem Level 5:	 Change an emotion, memory,''
''or thought into a faerie. Level 15: Release a faerie from a person’s''
''mind (with requisites appropriate to its new form).''

===Terram===

''Faeries of the mountains tend to be gruff and slow, though like avalanches they can sometimes move with surprising speed. Those associated with earth are often warm and soft-hearted, while faeries of stone can be cold and passionless. Iron faeries are usually wicked and demonic.''
''Creo Terram Level 3:	 Create a faerie associated with''
''sand, dirt, mud, or clay. Level 5:	 Create a faerie associated with''
''stone or glass.''
''Level 15: Create a faerie associated with''
''base metal. Level 25: Create a faerie associated with''
''precious metal. Level 35: Create a faerie associated with''
''gemstone.''
''Muto Terram Level 4:	 Change dirt, sand, mud, or clay''
''into a faerie. Level 5:	 Change stone or glass into a''
''faerie. Level 10: Change metal or gemstone''
''into a faerie.''

===Vim===

''Vim faeries are the most unpredictable of all, essentially raw magic given life. They are associated with supernatural effects and especially Warping, and are drawn to auras, spells, and enchanted devices. They have powers similar to daimons (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, Theurgy). Note that spells changed into faeries only last as long as the original spell, even if the transformation spell has a longer duration.''
''Creo Vim Level 4:	 Create a faerie daimon.''
''Muto Vim Gen: Change a spell or effect of level less''
''than or equal to (this spell’s level + 5) into a faerie. Level 2:	 Change vis into a faerie, with''
''(number of pawns x 5) Might Points, using up the vis in the process.''

==Animae Guidelines, Continued==

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"

''After the maga has become a faerie, she may strengthen her connection to the Faerie realm by performing lesser transformation rituals, further empowering the enchantment. In this way, the maga can give herself faerie powers or better imitate aspects of humanity that she has given up in the Becoming ritual. Here are three examples of lesser transformation rituals, though other rituals that impart faerie powers may exist, and could be discovered through experimentation or original research.''

|}
''Altering the Enchantment: The maga can make herself appear older or younger, and can choose a different Technique and Form to determine her physical appearance; or she can alter the Arts that determine her faerie personality; or she can increase her Might Score and change the associated Form. The level of this enchantment is the same level as the transformation ritual she is altering.''
''Inspired Knowledge: The maga can give herself a score of 1 in a new Ability, so long as she could learn it if she were human and has set aside 5 experience points for it. She can also master spells in this way, assuming she knows the spell she wishes to master. The level of this enchantment is the sum of her scores in all Abilities that belong to different categories. For example, when learning a Martial Ability she would add up her scores in non-Martial Abilities, including spell mastery Abilities, to determine the effect level.''
''The Empowered Faerie: The maga can learn a new spell, essentially a faerie power that she can activate with her Might. The level of the enchantment is equal to the level of the spell she will gain, which costs her a number of Might Points equal to its magnitude to cast. Exceeding the level by fi ve reduces this Might cost by one, so that doubling it makes the spell cost nothing. She can also reduce the cost of spells she already knows with this same ritual. Likewise, she can increase the number of Might Points a power costs to activate in the same way, if she wishes to increase her Penetration Total.''

===The Line of Quendalon===

''After the House Divided, Quendalon took many new apprentices, desiring to share the knowledge he had gained from Faerie with his loyal followers. He also taught other magi his secrets, without requiring anything from them in return, in order to spread his magic throughout the Order. These magi came to be known as the Line of Quendalon. In return for his fantastic powers, Quendalon asked only that they join his House, and pledge their loyalty to him as Primus. Since then, the leaders of the House have all descended from this line, including Rhiannon, Vinaria, and Handri.''
''Quendalon Initiated his followers in all three Arcadian Mysteries, and characters descended from his lineage may Initiate Arcadian Travel or Animae Magic through one of many well-known Initiation Scripts. Having himself been raised by faeries, Quendalon was said to have encouraged all of his followers to place Gifted children in their care, and so many of his line have Faerie-Raised Magic. Others commonly have a Major Magical Focus with Faerie. When they believe they are ready, having mastered the other Inner Mysteries, the elders of the line Initiate their fi lii into Becoming, and assist them in the transformation from human to faerie.''
''Quendalon never took a familiar, and so these Merinitae are less critical of those who choose to forgo the Founder’s ritual, though they often have faerie friends and maintain complex relationships with the fae. The most popular Arts in this lineage are Vim, Muto, and Creo, and most Merinitae study a Form that represents the type of faeries in which they are most interested. Quendalon is said to have particularly favored Terram.''
''These magi are sometimes associated with the name “The Last Commission,” in reference to a legend that Bonisagus himself smiled upon Quendalon’s efforts, charging him with the task of making the power of the Faerie realm more accessible to all magi. For this reason, Quendalon’s followers occasionally Initiate magi from other Houses, particularly Bonisagus. Many of them are Seekers, and more than any other Merinitae they devote''
''themselves to experimental research and exploring the frontiers of Hermetic magic.''

''Ease Factor: 21 (Major Virtue known to the Mystagogue)''
''Script Bonus: +16 Script Details: The Initiate must spend a season visiting a Faerie aura, studying its inhabitants, and taking detailed notes on their behavior and relationships (+3). Then she must fi nd and befriend the faerie that is most appropriate to her highest Technique and Form (+1), taking the Faerie Friend Flaw (+3). To secure its lasting friendship, she must make a bargain with it, giving up a uniquely human quality that cannot be replaced, such as the color of her eyes, all memory of her parents, or her fi rstborn child (+6). She also receives a Prohibition never to break her word, or she will suffer a faerie wasting sickness (+3).''

==Folk Mysteries==


|}
''The common people have collected a great deal of wisdom about faeries over the years, and Merinitae have adapted that folklore into a unique set of Mysteries. These explore faerie magic associated with charms (see above), including charms that focus spells on particular targets, charms that invoke archetypal events, and charms that harness the power of symbols and sympathetic magic in the lab.''

===Charm Magic (Minor Folk Mystery)===

''This Inner Mystery allows a Merinita to incorporate charms into her spells, making them more potent through sympathetic magic. This requires that she fi rst invent a spell that incorporates a specifi c charm; this can be done with spontaneous, formulaic, or ritual spells. She must decide how the charm applies to the target and include this in the spell description. For example, if the name “Darius” were integrated into a spell, she''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''could use a “Darius” charm when casting it on a target named Darius. Likewise, a spell might involve “winter,” “an axe,” or something “red.”''

|}
''A single charm imparts a +2 bonus to the Casting Total of the spell. The maga may incorporate the charm specifi ed by the spell into her actions whenever she casts it; she must either create the temporary charm at the time of casting or have the object associated with a permanent charm at hand. When casting spells with the charms described above, she might tell a story about a person called Darius, or draw a picture that depicts winter, or whittle a stick into the shape of an axe, or play a song that suggests the color red.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Example: Mari Amwithig of Merinita has Initiated Charm Magic, and modifi ed her spell Slay the Innocent (PeCo[An]30) to include an “enemy” charm. She spends three hours composing a poem about an enemy, inscribing it on a fi ne piece of tanned vellum, and succeeds at her Communication + Language roll against Ease Factor 9. Whenever she reads this poem from the scroll while casting her spell on one of her enemies, she receives a +2 bonus to her Casting Total.''

|}
''A spell can also incorporate several charms at once: when she invents the spell, the maga specifi es all the charms it involves, up to as many as her score in Faerie Magic. There are also several categories that can be used to describe charms. These help to explain in what way a charm applies to the target, and are noted next to the charm like so: “Darius” (character), “winter” (event), “axe” (item), “red” (aspect). The maga receives a +1 bonus to her Casting Total for each charm incorporated into the casting, and an additional +1 bonus for each category represented by these charms. For example, a spell designed to affect a “magus” (character) named “Darius” (character) in “winter” (event) would give the maga a +5 Casting Total bonus; +3 for three charms, and +2 for two different categories.''

===Casting Total Bonus: +1 for Each===


===Charm, +1 for Each Category===


===Represented===

{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''The maga can also use charms to improve the effectiveness of her Penetration using an Arcane Connection to the target. This increases her Penetration Multiplier''

|}
''by one for each category beyond the fi rst represented by the spell, in addition to the normal +2 for a symbolic representation (see Sympathetic Connections, ArM5 page 86). A spell designed to affect “Darius” (character) in “winter” (event) would give the maga +3 to her Penetration Multiplier when cast with an Arcane Connection.''

===Sympathetic Connection Bonus: +2,===


===+1 for Each Category Beyond the FI Rst===

''When casting a spell associated with several charms, the maga can design a single charm that incorporates all of the different concepts at once. For example, instead of writing three different songs, one about a “magus,” another about “Darius,” and a third about “winter,” she can write a single song about “Darius the magus in winter.” However, each additional concept adds 3 to the Ease Factor for making a charm, so that the song “Darius the magus in winter” would require a Communication + Music roll against an Ease Factor of 12 to compose.''
''Spells may be designed so that the target is itself the charm, if the effect produces an artistic or poetically satisfying result. This requires about ten minutes of preparation and an Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to succeed. For example, a spell intended to turn a person into a lion could play upon the fact that both the warrior and a lion are brave, and so the spell could be designed to incorporate a “brave” (aspect) charm. However, the charm would have no effect if the target were not particularly Brave.''
''At the storyguide’s discretion, charms that are absurdly broad — such as “a person” (character) or “Mythic Europe” (place) — give no bonus. Charms that the storyguide thinks inappropriate to the situation at hand may also fail. Anyone might be an “enemy,” for example, and so it may be necessary for the player to adequately explain how the charm distinguishes the spell’s target from other possible targets in order to receive the bonus.''
''A spell incorporating charms may be cast without the charms being at hand, or''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''on a target that does not correspond to the charms. However, the bonuses only apply if the maga has the charms and the target is appropriate.''

|}
''Instead of increasing her spell mastery abilities, a maga may devote mastery experience to associate additional charms with her formulaic spells. For each charm, this costs her 1 experience point per magnitude of the spell being modifi ed. Any of the charms associated with a spell may be used when casting that spell, though the total number of charms incorporated into a spell’s casting can never exceed her score in Faerie Magic.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|

===Story Magic (Major Folk Mystery)===


|}
''Folk magicians know that things must always happen a certain way in a medieval story, and believe that they themselves are taking part in an unfolding story. This Mystery allows the maga to infl uence the story of her own life, by using a kind of folk magic that alters the course of events by inspiring particular circumstances, as they should happen in a medieval story. She brings about conditions that match the way that things would be in a myth or legend, just as faeries come into being according to popular beliefs and stories.''
''Story Magic requires that the maga fi rst design a story charm. This is a special kind of charm that cannot be designed spontaneously, as it draws upon a unique quality of an event. For example, to make a “magus” story charm, she might need a connection to a particularly impressive magus. Perhaps to create a “winter” story charm, she would need to remember lying in a snowbank on the coldest night of the year. An “axe” story charm might require an especially fi ne axe, once used to chop down an entire forest. Finding an appropriate object to associate with a story charm might be part of a special quest, like locating a compatible animal for a familiar. Without this legendary frame of reference, a maga cannot make an effective story charm.''
''Once inspired, the maga prepares the charm as normal: she obtains an appropriate object to hold the charm and spends several hours designing it. Then she rolls the associated Characteristic + Ability against an Ease Factor of 9. Like Charm Magic charms, the charm should be given a descriptive term associated with a category (adage, aspect, etc.) to which the story event applies. After enduring a memorable siege, for example, she might make a “castle” (place), “battle” (event), or “haste makes waste” (adage) charm.''
''A story charm may be used at any time, though it is most appropriate when the character is on an adventure of some sort. Activating it requires the maga to spend a Confi dence Point. Afterward, the idea of the charm manifests at some point during the session: an event takes place, an object turns up, another character is affected, or a theme is emphasized, usually to the maga’s benefi t. The player may give suggestions for what she wants to happen, but the storyguide determines the actual results, somehow incorporating the concept of the charm into the narrative. This story element is entirely at the storyguide’s discretion; it must come into play, but does not necessarily come about as the player expects, and it is even possible for the effect to escape her notice.''
''Example: After Initiating Story Magic, Mari Amwithig manages to trick a faerie lord out of his birthright, and she represents this experience with a silver crown. She writes a poem about her cleverness, choosing a “shrewd” (aspect) charm, and''
''beats an Ease Factor of 9 on her Communication + Language roll: the crown becomes a story charm. Later, before entering a faerie market, she puts on the crown and spends a Confi dence Point, quietly reciting her poem to herself. Because of this, the storyguide rules that she bargains particularly well, and shrewdly trades a cask of wine for a goblin servant who will obey her for a year and a day, or until she asks it a question it cannot answer.''
''Generally, a story charm should be applicable to the current situation, manifesting as a clue to a mystery, or an ally with a useful bit of aid. Perhaps it could be represented as a temporary bonus to certain rolls. It is not miraculous or even very powerful, but should make the player feel as if she has some additional control over the direction of the scene. Think of it like a Minor Story Flaw that applies to the adventure as a whole, which the maga can take advantage of if she watches for it. If a clear mechanical benefi t is needed, assume the character has a +3 bonus on all rolls associated with the charm for the entire scene.''
''The maga may also substitute story charms for charms in Charm Magic spells. In this way, story charms are like “wild cards” for their particular charm category. A story charm can be used in place of any charm from its same category: a maga could substitute a “guide” (character) story charm for a “magus” (character) or a “Darius” (character) charm when casting a spell that incorporates one of those charms, since they all affect characters. This still costs the maga a Confi dence Point to activate the charm.''

===Symbolic Magic (Major Folk Mystery)===

''Symbolic Magic encompasses several laboratory activities associated with charms and the symbols used in sympathetic magic.''
''A maga with Symbolic Magic may use charms when designing invested devices, up to as many charms as her score in Faerie Magic, adding double the charm and category bonuses to her Lab Total instead of her Casting Total. If used with an Arcane Connection, this also increases the Penetration Multiplier for the device, which is only useful if''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|

==Charm Categories==

''Adage: “There is truth in wine,” “Power''
''corrupts,” or “Out of sight, out of mind.” Aspect: A particular quality of the''
''target, such as small, drunk, lazy, or rough. Character: The target’s name, occu''
''pation, title, bloodline, nickname, age, or birthmark. Event: What the target is doing: a''
''chase, seeking justice, in love, a rescue, or a quest. Item: The target’s shape or material, or''
''an object strongly associated with the target. Place: The location of the target: a''
''forest, mountain, covenant, village, or ship.''
''some levels are set aside for Penetration. As the charms are built into the effect at creation, the effect cannot affect a target that is not covered by the charms, unlike a spell using charms, which merely loses the bonus. The trigger action must also incorporate these charms, so the effect cannot have an environmental or linked trigger, though the maga may still restrict who can use the device.''

|}
''Example: Mari Amwithig’s parens builds her an enchanted ﬂ ute with several invested effects using Symbolic Magic. One of them is an effect that allows her to speak with animals (InAn20). This incorporates three charms: “this animal can ﬂ y” (aspect), “dark” (aspect), and “one hears only what one wants to hear” (adage), which gives him a +10 bonus to his Lab Total (three charms and two different categories, doubled). This limits the effect to dark animals that can ﬂ y, and neither she nor the animal will hear something they do not wish to hear. If she has an Arcane Connection to the animal, she receives a +3 bonus to her Penetration Multiplier. To activate the ﬂ ute, she must play a song about ﬂ ying, darkness, and hearing what one wants to hear.''
''A maga with this Virtue can also add charm bonuses to her talisman. Like attuning it to an effect associated with its shape or material, the maga can modify her talisman to act as a charm in particular circumstances, increasing her Casting Total whenever those circumstances apply, as with Charm Magic. A talisman may be attuned to as many charms as she likes, but only one charm may be attuned each season, and no more charms than her score in Faerie Magic may be incorporated into a single effect.''
''A maga with Symbolic Magic may design permanent charms that other characters may use, creating symbolic representations or integrating the effects of Arcadian Travel or Story Magic into objects that characters without those Mysteries can carry. The wielder activates the charm instead of the maga who designed it, and so must spend the necessary Confi dence Point, or concentrate upon the trod’s destination, when the charm is used.''
''Finally, the maga gains the ability to design ritual spells that use a new Symbol Range, Duration, and Target, described below. Each ritual requires that she make a symbolic representation that identifi es''
''the target through at least three different charms (this requires Faerie Magic 3 and a Characteristic + Ability roll against an Ease Factor of 12 to design the symbol). For example, a portrait designed to affect the Faerie Queen of Irencillia at Symbol Range might include a “queen” (character) charm, a “winter” (event) charm, and a “faerie” (character) charm. To use Symbol Range, Duration, and Target together in one spell would require a total of nine charms (requiring Faerie Magic 9).''
''If any of the charms do not apply when the ritual is cast, the spell fails; if any of the conditions associated with these charms cease to apply while the spell is still active, the effect ends immediately.''
''Each use of a symbol requires a unique ritual spell. However, if the charms are described broadly enough, the same ritual can be used again in different circumstances. For example, the ritual spell described above could affect a human queen with faerie blood when cast in winter, so long as new “queen,” “winter,” and “faerie” charms were fashioned to identify her.''

===Heirs To Merlin===

''At the inauguration of House Ex Miscellanea in 817, there was a great party of non-Hermetic wizards from the British Isles who accompanied Pralix to''
''the Rhineland and participated in her welcoming ceremony as the thirteenth House. Among these were a Welsh seer named Emrys and his six-year-old son Ambrosius. Emrys had forseen that his son would die while still a child, but made a pact with the faeries of his homeland to trade his own life instead. He had long served as a magical advisor to a faerie court, and by order of the faerie king he was granted a stay of seven years and a day (the remaining time his son would have lived) to see to the boy’s future before taking his place in the Halls of the Dead.''
''Emrys was interested in his son’s joining House Merinita: at the same Tribunal that Emrys swore the Oath, Quendalon announced his House’s new dedication to Faerie. The jewel-eyed Primus listened to the seer’s story, accepted his charge, and took the boy back with him to Irencillia. Emrys went with them, remaining long enough to see his son settled and formally adopted as Quendalon’s apprentice, before returning to Wales to face his end. It was said that afterward, those with Second Sight could sometimes see the spirit of Emrys watching over the boy during the summer months.''
''Ambrosius of Merinita obviously had strong faerie heritage (his mother was a faerie enchantress, or so it was said) and had already demonstrated signs of potent supernatural abilities before Quendalon''

''Symbol (Range): You can affect something represented by a symbol as if you had an Arcane Connection to it, essentially allowing you to create an Arcane Connection to your target. This spell must be a ritual, but is otherwise equivalent to Arcane Connection range. If the symbol does not uniquely describe the target, the spell fails, since an Arcane Connection must be specifi c to a single target (unless cast with Target: Symbol).''
''Symbol (Duration): The effect lasts as long as the symbol does (and the symbol must be a physical object, so that a poem or song, for example, must be written down). If the symbol is broken,''
''erased, falls apart, dies, or is otherwise damaged, the spell ends. If the target changes so that any of the qualities of the symbol no longer apply, the spell is interrupted, but the effects return once these qualities are true again — unlike the Until (Condition) Duration, this effect can outlive the caster. It is the same level as Year, and requires a ritual to cast.''
''Symbol (Target): You affect all targets represented by the symbol within range of the spell. It is calculated at the same level as Boundary, though it is essentially a large Group, and modifi ers according to the size of the target apply. It must be cast as a ritual.''

==Symbol Range, Duration, & Target==

''Initiated him into the secrets of Faerie Magic. As he grew, he began to demonstrate an instinctive knowledge of other Mysteries, magic associated with charms and symbols, and with fortune and fate. He had a remarkable affi nity for making symbolic predictions, and wrote many of these on long scrolls in poetic couplets.''

|}
''He took apprentices of his own, and by his example they learned to perform similar feats of prophecy, though each of them used a different medium. One of his followers carried a set of carved stones with symbols on them, which he would throw and consult when casting his spells. Another was a musician, who would compose a different song for each charm. A third was interested in heraldry, and made charms based on colors and devices.''

|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''This Hermetic lineage still survives as the “Heirs to Merlin,” for many claim that Ambrosius’s father was descended from the great wizard of old. Their followers often act as advisors to faerie courts — magi are not supposed to serve as court wizards to mundanes, as that is considered beneath their dignity, but there is no reason a magus cannot swear fealty to a faerie king or queen, so long as he does not invite their wrath upon the Order as a whole.''

|}
''The Heirs may Initiate Charm Magic or Story Magic, and typically learn Symbolic Magic later in life, usually after their masters retire and they take over their positions at court. Many of them have Faerie Blood and often develop''
''Premonitions, Second Sight, or a Major Magical Focus with charms. Binding The Gift is also common. Intellego is by far their most popular Art. They often swear fealty to faerie lords or ladies when Initiating Faerie Magic, and their Initiatory Quests for the Inner Mysteries might involve serving their will, protecting their realms, or making war against their enemies.''

===Sample Heirs To Merlin Initiation: Charm Magic===

''Ease Factor: 15 (Minor Virtue known to the Mystagogue)''
''Script Bonus: +8 Script Details: The Initiate must choose a particular kind of charm Ability and spend a year as an apprentice to a master of the art (+1). She must then design a charm for a faerie noble using very expensive materials (high quality wood, an exceptional instrument, a rich costume, or gold ink) (+1) that depicts a special symbolic quality of her patron (+3), fi rst seeking out and obtaining a unique object of myth or legend to associate with the charm (+3), such as an artifact that once belonged to a famous magus or historical fi gure of old.''

==Illusion Mysteries==

''These Mysteries deal with illusions and images, including aspects of the physical world that faeries can see but most humans cannot. These include unusual durations for Faerie Magic spells that can last nearly forever.''

===Spell Timing (Minor Illusion Mystery)===

''This Mystery gives a maga access to several new Durations for her spells. Only those who have Initiated this Mystery may cast or invent spells and effects that use them.''
''Three of these new durations allow the maga to cast a spell but keep it dormant, “holding” it for a specifi ed length of time. The effect and its Penetration are evaluated when it is released, as if she had''
''just cast the spell. If the parameters are no longer applicable (the target has moved out of range, for example, or dramatically changed size), the spell has no effect.''
''Held (duration): This duration is the same level as Concentration. The maga may cast the spell as normal, but the effect is delayed for as long as she concentrates. When she releases it, treat it as if cast with Momentary duration. Midday/MidnigHt (duration): This duration is equivalent to Sun, but does not manifest until dawn, dusk, noon, or midnight. It then lasts until the next dawn, dusk, noon, or midnight. For example, a spell cast just after dawn would not manifest until noon, and would then last until dusk. season (duration): This duration is held until the start of the next equinox or solstice, and lasts only until the following equinox or solstice. It is the same level as Moon, but requires a ritual spell like Year.''
''Three other durations have conditions that must be built into the spell when it is designed, similar to the Until (Condition) Duration.''
''WHile (condition) (duration): The target must perform some activity, such as a musical performance or reading a book, or fulfi ll some common and temporary physical condition, such as sleeping or being drunk. As long as that condition lasts, the spell remains in effect. This is the same level as Concentration. not (condition) (duration): The spell lasts for as long as the target does not fulfi ll some common physical condition, such as sleeping or speaking. It is equivalent in level to Sun duration, but cannot last longer than a month. if (condition) (duration): This effect triggers if the target fulfi lls a specifi c condition. It has an additional Duration, which determines how long the triggered spell lasts after it takes effect. To determine the level, add four magnitudes to the level cal''

==Recurring Spells==

''Use the frequency that most closely matches how often the spell recurs, rounding up to the next greater magnitude. For example, a spell that recurs every ten minutes adds fi ve magnitudes. Spells cannot recur more often than once per minute.''

===Frequency Magnitudes===

''minute +5''
''day +4''
''month +3''
''year +2''
''decade +1''
''culated based on the Duration that the spell has when it takes effect, and it must be cast as a ritual spell. The spell expires without triggering if the caster passes into Twilight (even temporarily), if the caster dies, or if a year passes.''

|}
''In addition, this Mystery allows the Merinita’s spells to have recurring effects. Such spells are designed so that from their casting onward, they always trigger in response to an environmental or physical condition, increasing its level as described on the chart below. A recurring spell must be cast as a ritual, and effects that require a ritual because of their unusual effects or non-Hermetic origins (not because of their level or spell parameters) cannot recur. For example, a ritual with Year duration can be made to recur, but a lasting effect like Chirurgeon’s Healing Touch (CrCo20) or a unique effect like Breath of the Open Sky (ReAu40) cannot.''
''Recurring spells may be given triggers, using the special (Condition) durations above. The cost for making them recur is based on how often they can be activated; if a daily-recurring effect is activated twice in one day, the second trigger has no effect. Also, spells cannot stack; when a spell recurs, it cancels before starting again. This is not a noticeable interruption; as with an enchanted device, the transition usually appears constant.''

===Glamour (Major Illusion Mystery)===

''Glamours are illusions with a signifi cant amount of reality. They are Muto or Creo Imaginem spells that only magi with this Virtue may invent or cast.''
''A glamour seems to have all the properties of an actual thing of the same type, including substance. Thus, a glamour bridge can support weight, a glamour fi re can ignite parchment, and glamour wine can quench thirst. They are essentially real for the spell’s duration, which means that they can have lasting effects on their environment.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Since glamours are more “solid” than other illusions, they are resisted by the Parma Magica and other forms of Magic''

|}
''Resistance, unlike the images produced by other Imaginem spells. This is because glamour does not simply make the target emit changed species, it actually magical''
''ly modifi es the species themselves. They are, however, still species, and are only affected by the Imaginem form; a glamour of a stone is not affected by Terram, but''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''Particularly intricate glamours, such as those that mimic a recognizable subject, or those with complex sensory components such as clear words or moving parts, add an additional magnitude to the spell. To produce a glamour that can move or act under the caster’s mental direction adds two magnitudes.''
''Changing an animate target (something that can move under its own power) into an inanimate object is also more diffi cult, and requires two additional magnitudes. Over time, however, the target begins to regain its mobility unless the caster regularly concentrates on the effect. For example, a person may be changed into a tree, but if ignored for a few days that tree may begin to move and resemble a person, as its essential nature begins to reassert itself over the glamour.''
''The fi nal form of a target changed into glamour will usually have recognizable properties in common with its true shape. For example, a person transformed into an animal might be extremely expressive and possibly retain other human qualities such as the ability to speak or walk upright. Size modifi ers also apply to the spell level if there is a signifi cant difference between the original shape and the new shape.''
''creo iMagineM Level 10: Create a glamour.''
''Muto iMagineM Level 10: Change a target into glamour.''
''(Requisite of the Form of the target required.)''

==Glamour Guidelines==

''A curious application of Glamour has developed among the Merinita branch of the Followers of Pendule, inspired by the stories of their namesake. Instead of using metamagic to change spells into other spells, they use glamours to change spells into other spells. These spell glamours must conform to the guidelines for Muto Vim, in that they cannot affect spontaneous magic, must target a spell cast by another, must be fast-cast, and must penetrate the spell’s Penetration Total. They must also specify the Form of the affected spell, as well as the type of magic (Hermetic, Faerie Magic, hedge tradition, etc.).''
''Spell glamours are excellent for countermagic, but when used deliberately on an unsuspecting magus, they are considered to deprive him of his magical power, and magi whose pranks have destructive effects could fi nd themselves taken to Tribunal on this''
''charge. Pendule’s followers are loathed by most magi of House Flambeau, and may also fi nd themselves embroiled in Wizard’s Wars with them as a matter of principle.''

===Ball of Abysmal Music===

''MuIm 20 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind Req: Vim This spell targets a formulaic Ignem spell while it is being cast, changing it so that instead of creating fi re, heat, or light, it produces a harmless burst of color and sound. This was reputedly Pendule’s favorite spell, and he taught it to all of his Merinita followers after Initiating them into the Inner Mystery of Glamour. Note that since the spell must be fast-cast, it cannot be cast formulaically unless it has been mastered for that purpose.''
''(Base 10, +2 Voice)''

==Spell Glamours==

''can be destroyed by Perdo Imaginem. Glamours are also illusions, and characters with Second Sight can see through them if they look carefully. Knowing that something is a glamour does not protect the character against it, though; after all, a fi re glamour is still a fi re and burns those who touch it whether they can see through it or not.''

|}
''Merinitae always gain the Vulnerable Magic Flaw when they Initiate this Mystery. Because of this, many believe that people cannot be killed by glamours, since each one has a particular vulnerability that can undo its effects. It is said that when killed by a glamour from a maga vulnerable to iron, for example, a person touched with an iron nail might return to life. Some think this might be because a faerie that resembles him comes to take his place, or because his body comes to be possessed by a faerie spirit, and some think it means that the ghosts of people killed by glamours remain in Arcadia until they truly die.''

===Perpetuity (Major Illusion Mystery)===


|}
''This Mystery gives access to three spell durations that can potentially last forever. All three are the same level as Year, and always require a ritual to cast.''
''MigHt (duration): Either the target or the caster must have Faerie or Magic Might, and must be alive; the spell fails if this condition is not met, including by passing into Wizard’s Twilight, Arcadia, or some other otherworldly state. aura (duration): The spell lasts for as long as the target remains within a supernatural aura. If the target leaves the aura or the physical world entirely (dies, goes into Twilight, or goes to Arcadia, for example) the spell ends. This does allow moving from one aura to another, so long as the two auras overlap — as long as the target never leaves a supernatural aura of some kind. Hidden (duration): The spell lasts as long as the caster or target (or a signifi cant part of the caster or''

''target) is hidden — buried in the earth, placed inside a box, covered with a curtain or disguised by a costume — anything, even another spell, so long as the effect with the Hidden duration does not itself hide the target. If anyone other than the caster discovers it, the spell ends immediately.''
''Merinitae who learn Perpetuity usually gain the Unnatural Magic Flaw during their Initiation.''

===Mystery Cult: The Followers of Pendule===

''Pendule is regarded as something of a legend within the Order; no one knows how much of his tale is true and how much is fanciful. According to the stories, the Provencal wizard was discovered by Flambeau and refused when given the choice to “join or die.” He was powerful enough to evade the fi ery Founder and his followers who sought to destroy him, and many comedic tales depicting Pendule as a trickster defeating the mighty and blustery Flambeau with wit and illusions have become part of Hermetic lore.''
''Eventually, it seems, Pendule tired of these games and adopted four Hermetic magi as his followers. No one knows exactly why he did this; perhaps he simply wanted to share his secrets with others before he died, or perhaps he desired to learn Hermetic magic theory from them. Two of these followers were from House Merinita, and having Initiated Faerie Magic from Quendalon they were able to master the illusion Mysteries Pendule taught — the others could not comprehend them. Afterwards, these Merinitae continued to teach the secrets to their followers as part of a special House lineage.''
''Pendule’s magic was very sensual and personal, and he especially believed in the use of color and sound in his spells. He expected magic to transform the wielder, rather than yield submissively to him, and while he was oddly sensitive to the passage of time, he seemed to have great diffi culty with standard Hermetic durations, preferring spells that relied upon strange conditions or that triggered after being''
''cast. He also practiced other Mysteries which his Merinita followers did not master, and other lineages dedicated to his magic still exist in other Houses and cults within (and perhaps without) the Order.''
''Followers of Pendule usually Initiate Spell Timing and Glamour from their masters. Imaginem is almost always their primary Art. A common weakness in the lineage is iron — both of the Merinitae who studied Pendule’s secrets were especially susceptible to it — and Pendule Merinitae often learn Spell Improvisation or a Major Magical Focus in counterspells.''
''Pendule quietly succumbed to death in 854, but not before imparting one last magical secret to each of his followers. To maintain this tradition, the Inner Mystery of Perpetuity is usually kept from a maga until her master is dying, Initiated as a fi nal lesson from teacher to student.''

===Sample Followers of Pendule Initiation: Spell Timing===

''Ease Factor: 15 (Minor Virtue known to the Mystagogue)''
''Script Bonus: +12 Script Details: The Initiate undergoes a ceremony wherein she must go an entire day and night without sleeping, casting a non-Fatiguing Imaginem spell every round to count how many individual moments pass (+3). After this rite she gains three Minor Flaws to represent how her magic becomes more illusionary, and her way of thinking about time becomes more rigid: Harmless Magic (+3), Poor Memory (faces) (+3), and Social Handicap (+3). Because of this Ordeal, the Initiate is said to begin to more closely resemble Pendule, and many of his followers adopt wild, multicolored clothing, dye their hair, or radically alter their physical appearance soon after their Initiation.''

==Nature Mysteries==

''Merinita knew a very different kind of magic from that which the rest of the House practices. It dealt with the power of untamed wildlands and drawing out the magical qualities of nature. Her Mysteries fall outside the bounds of Faerie Magic and are not usually available to members''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''of her House. They can sometimes be found among magi from other Houses, especially Bjornaers from the lost line of Myanar, and one or two nature magi supposedly remain in the House to show the way to others, teaching the nature Mysteries alongside the House Mysteries of Faerie Magic. For the most part, however, the nature Mysteries are mysteries to members of Merinita’s House.''

|}

===Nature Lore (Minor Outer Mystery)===

''As an initial step into the nature Mysteries, a maga must choose a type of nature with which she is associated. This represents her supernatural connection to the natural world. The character gains a Supernatural Ability, called Nature Lore, which is associated with this form of nature. For example, a character interested in forests would learn Forest Lore, and a maga who is interested in animals would learn Animal Lore. This Mystery gives her a score of 1 in this Ability. Merinita’s interest was reputedly Forests, and thus that is the most common version — characters who have learned Forest Lore as described in Guardians of the Forests: The Rhine Tribunal effectively possess this Ability.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''The character’s score in Nature Lore serves many purposes. For one thing, it''

|}
''can be used as Area Lore for the place in which the maga learned it. This includes knowledge of supernatural beings and places with an association to the area, especially what would please or anger them. As this understanding grows, the maga develops a rapport even outside of this familiar territory, allowing her to commune with nature in other places. To represent this, always treat her score in Nature Lore as three less outside of her home region.''
''In this same way, Nature Lore allows the character to communicate with all nature associated with her Ability. For many aspects of nature, this communication is slow going and many concepts are diffi cult to convey, since the character is limited to the senses and sounds possessed by the subject. A character with Mountain Lore 5 can interrogate a rock by simply touching it, though this process probably takes several hours.''
''Nature Lore can only be increased through Adventure, Practice, or Exposure experience, and the Source Quality is equal to the aura of the area. Nature magi''
''usually develop a deep attachment to this place and spend a lot of time there.''
''The character may Initiate other Mysteries by communing with the supernatural aspects of nature. This process is called “walking the path.” The character must fi nd a magical being associated with her Ability that is willing to teach her its secrets. In game terms, the character gains''

''The following describe the effects of various Nature Lore scores. Negative scores have no useful effect. Always treat a maga’s score in Nature Lore as three less outside of her home region.''
''0 An elementary understanding of the''
''area; the maga merely has to spend a few hours in such a place to locate its important sites and know its major dangers. 1 A basic understanding of the place,''
''its denizens, and important locations. Limited communication is possible. 2 An awareness of the supernatural''
''elements of the area; the maga can detect when they are nearby, or whether a person has been affected by them; she can perceive the boundaries of magical regiones within the area. 3 The maga can locate vis in the area,''
''once per season, by spending only a few days searching.''
''4 An understanding with the area’s''
''supernatural residents; they tend to act neutrally towards the maga. Through signs and their behavior, the character can recognize when danger is near or there is a disturbance in the normal way of things. 5 The maga can communicate fl uently''
''with nature in the area. The maga is respected by most of the denizens. 6 The maga is respected and acknowl''
''edged as an ally by the area and its denizens. Residents usually come to the maga’s aid when called for. 7 The maga can mentally communi''
''cate with the denizens of the area, simply by thinking about them. The maga has only to concentrate to summon help. 8 The maga can target any part of''
''the area as if she had a permanent Arcane Connection to it. 9 All the denizens of the area feel''
''compelled to obey the maga, and follow her commands faithfully.''

''a Flaw (the “sacrifi ce”), performs a task assigned by the teacher (the “quest”), and at the conclusion gains a special Virtue (the “fruit”). A Minor Flaw yields a Minor Virtue, and a Major Flaw grants a Major Virtue. More information on this process and several sample paths may be found in Guardians of the Forests: The Rhine Tribunal.''

===Awakening (Minor Nature Mystery)===


|}
''Nature magi may learn to bring forth a natural intelligence within subjects associated with their Nature Lore Ability. In a sense, they “awaken” the spirit of the area, making it self-aware, and such beings are typically devoted to the care and safety of their region, connected to it by their very nature. Merinita’s ritual for binding a familiar is said to be based partly on this Mystery.''
''Awakening takes at least a season, and requires a naturally fi ne specimen that is representative of the area, but which is not already awakened. For animals, the creature should have Magic Might, or embody the area in some capacity (the leader of a pack of wolves, for example, or the largest fi sh in the pond). For other beings, the area must have a magical aura, and the subject should be the focus of the aura, such as the great tree in the center of the forest, or the spirit of the mountain deep in the heart of the rock. One spirit per aura can be awakened; for animals with Magic Might, similar standards to those for fi nding and befriending a familiar apply, though not quite as strictly, since the results are more akin to a parentchild relationship than a bond between lifelong companions.''
''The maga then generates a total based on a Technique and Form that will determine the personality of the awakened being, though she must use Nature Lore instead of Magic Theory and she does not include the aura of her lab, since she performs the ritual in the wild and uses that aura instead. The base level is 25 plus the subject’s Might plus or minus fi ve times the being’s Size, or fi ve times the aura plus the area’s Size modifi er (see sidebar). This is similar to the formula for enchanting a familiar; a creature with''
''Might 5 and Size –3 would require a modifi ed lab total of 15, while the spirit of an aura of 5 with an area modifi er +5 would be level 50.''

===Awakening Total: Intelligence + Nature Lore + Technique + Form +===

===Awakening Level: 25 + Might + (Size===


===X 5), Or (Aura + Size Modiﬁ Er) X 5===

''As when binding a familiar, the character’s total must equal or exceed this effect level to complete the ritual, which costs one pawn of vis of an Art associated with the maga’s Nature Lore Ability for each fi ve levels of the total. Once the enchantment is complete, the being gains a Magic Might score if does not already have one, equal to the (aura x 5), and if it is an animal it gains Intelligence instead of Cunning.''

===Awakening Cost: 1 Pawn of Vis Per===


===FI Ve Levels Or Fraction===

''A maga may also spend additional seasons to imbue the newly awakened being with special powers, which it can activate with its Might. This is similar to crafting an invested device, for the subject has been prepared for enchantment as part of the awakening ritual. Note the amount of vis spent to awaken it, because this limits how many powers the maga can give it.''
''Determine each effect you want to enchant, just as if you were designing an effect for an invested device. If it matters, the being is considered both the wielder and the device for these powers. Then, invest the effect as normal, calculating your lab total based on the level of the invested effect. The total level of all effects cannot be greater than ten times the number of pawns of vis invested in the awakening ritual. That is, if awakening a creature cost three pawns of vis, it cannot possess more than 30 levels of magical effects.''
''You do not have to spend vis to invest these powers. Instead, each power will cost the spirit 1 Might Point for every 10 levels of the effect. However, you may spend vis to reduce the cost: fi ve''
''pawns associated with any of the Arts in the power reduces the activation cost by 1 Might Point. This can only be done at the time the power is instilled; you cannot make the power cheaper later.''

''Instead of imbuing it with powers, the maga may bind an awakened being as her familiar, and may invest the bond with powers as normal. Once the process of instilling an awakened being with magical powers is begun, however, it can never be undone, and it leaves the being unsuitable as a familiar ever after. Imbuing a being with magical powers causes such dramatic changes to it that the cords can no longer bind it.''

===Wilding (Major Nature Mystery)===

''Through this Inner Mystery, the maga learns to bring forth the power of nature in physical things. This is similar to extracting vis from a magical aura, in that it requires a season of time and effort, and produces a number of pawns of vis, though this vis’s physical form is temporary and must be used immediately, within a few days. Thus it cannot be used for seasonal activities or study; most nature magi use Wilding to make vis for their ritual spells.''
''The maga chooses a vessel appropriate to her Nature Lore Ability, which determines the Form of the vis produced: a stone might produce Terram vis, a plant Herbam vis, and a beast Animal vis. To be eligible for this process, the object must be completely natural, never worked through artifi ce or craft. For example, a stone must have broken naturally from the mountain, a plant must be growing''

''Only magi who have Initiated the Wilding Mystery may use this wild vis, or even identify it as vis without magic specially designed for that purpose. Other magi simply perceive its natural form.''

===Guardian of Nature (Major Nature Mystery)===

''A nature maga may learn to join her spirit with nature and herself become a guardian spirit. She immerses herself in the surrounding area — an area with a magical aura and with which she can speak fl uently using her Nature Lore Ability — and everything about the place becomes an extension of her being, called her locus. A maga who binds herself to a mountain can feel footsteps on the surface like a fl y traversing her skin. Another who''
''becomes one with the animals of an area can guide them like a hive mind, fl itting her consciousness from one to another to see what they see. Within the physical limitations of her locus, she may control nature as if it were an extension of her own body, guiding it how she thinks fi t.''
''To become one with an area, the maga must perform a secret ritual believed to have come from Merinita herself. This takes at least an hour of concentration, costs her a Fatigue Level and a number of pawns of vis equal to the level of the aura, which must be of a Form associated with her Nature Lore Ability. It also requires a Presence + Nature Lore roll against an Ease Factor of (the aura x Size Modifi er), using the Size Modifi ers given under Awakening, above. The maga may also take over an area already protected by a guardian spirit so long as she overcomes its Magic Resistance (see ArM5 page 184); the spirit is subsumed into her being when the ritual is completed.''

''If the maga is successful, her body becomes ghostly and invisible, and like a ghost she can no longer interact directly with the physical world. Her body is like a living memory of her human form that can be damaged and even destroyed with Mentem-based magic, but while it remains she may control it as an extension of her locus if she wishes, and she may even choose to leave her locus and return to her living body, though doing so requires at least an hour of concentration and ends the effect of the ritual.''
''As a guardian spirit, the maga does not age, and does not need to worry about human needs for survival—she does not eat, drink, or breathe, and she is invulnerable to extreme temperatures and physical damage. She may fatigue herself and can even fall unconscious, and still requires rest''
''and sleep as normal. She cannot study, but she does gain Exposure. She may still cast spells, though she does so without words and gestures, and she must be able to perceive her target within the constraints of her locus. To cast a spell with Sight range, for example, she must possess an animal in the area that can see her target. She can still gain Warping Points and experiences Twilight as normal. She also gains one Warping Point every year for being under a constant mystical effect.''
''If any part of her locus is tamed, or destroyed in an unnatural way, the maga experiences great pain as part of her being is torn away from her. This translates to a Light Wound for an individual object in her locus (like an animal or a stone), a Medium Wound for part of the area that makes up her locus (a circle of earth, or water in a stream), and a Heavy Wound''
''for a group of objects in her locus (such as several clouds or a grove of trees), all of which give penalties to the maga’s actions. If these injuries worsen, she gains an Aging Point and suffers a Crisis instead of dying. Time and appropriate Creo magic can eventually heal these wounds, so long as some of her locus remains unspoiled, but her locus is her essential nature, and if it is entirely undone, she dies a terrible death.''

===Mystery Cult: True Merinitae===

''During the fi rst part of the twelfth century, a Merinita magus named Mendalus proclaimed that Quendalon had done the House a great disservice by abandoning Merinita’s focus, and publicly sought to reconstruct the Founder’s nature Mysteries. He was later slain in Wizard’s War, but a few Merinitae sympathized with his purpose, and took up his work where he left off. They came to believe that Merinita still lived somewhere in Mythic Europe, and thought that if they could fi nd her, she would teach them her secrets.''
''Then in 1158, a young apprentice named Agnes announced she had met a lady in green in the forests of Bohemia, and learned a special sort of nature magic from her. She fi nished her training at Irencillia, but was soon hailed by Mendalus’s supporters as a “True Merinitae,” believed to have learned Nature Lore directly from the Founder. In the years since, Agnes is said to have Initiated other nature Mysteries by communing with Merinita’s spirit. She helped many of her elders learn these same secrets, often using ancient Initiation Scripts from before Quendalon’s time, and by 1220 she has taught two apprentices of her own.''
''These followers, and the older magi that she Initiated into the Nature Mysteries, make up an unusual cult that is often considered a House lineage. However, the idea that Merinita herself could still be alive after so many years strikes many as absurd, and is thought by others to be a form of deliberately wish''
''ful thinking. More sensible magi believe that someone must have impersonated the Founder as part of Agnes’s Initiation, perhaps to symbolically suggest that her legacy endures. Distrustful magi have even suggested that Agnes could have learned her magic from disgraced Diedne wizards, not Merinitae at all, though the True Merinitae vehemently deny these allegations and refuse to listen to speculation on the subject.''
''True Merinitae always begin with Nature Lore, but they must also Initiate Faerie Magic if they belong to House Merinita. Over time, they may discover other Mysteries associated with their Nature Lore, usually by “walking the path” with a nature spirit. They tend to have less disturbing Gifts, often taking one or more versions of the Inoffensive and Alluring to (Beings) Virtues, and some learn a Major Magical Focus with the wilderness, affecting natural materials unworked by human hands. Since other Merinitae are suspicious of their origins, True Merinitae typically have poor reputations. They may even keep Dark Secrets from their sodales concerning the forbidden origins of their magic.''

''Ease Factor: 21 (Major Virtue known to the Mystagogue)''
''Script Bonus: +19 Script Details: This Initiation Script supposedly comes to the True Merinitae from the galli, a sect of nature worshippers once associated with the wild lands beyond the Roman Empire, by way of integration into the Cult of Diana. The magus must host a festival honoring Cybelle, a goddess of the wilderness, from the 15th to the 27th of March (+1). On March 24th, The Day of Blood, while revelers dance and play cymbals, drums, and fl utes, he is ritually castrated (+6) beneath a pine sacred to Cybelle (+1), and enough of his blood collected to fi ll a bowl (+1). Through this Ordeal, he gains the ShortRanged Magic Flaw (+9), and his Wizard’s Sigil changes slightly to become associated with violets (+1).''

==Mystery Story Seeds==

''A faerie agrees to serve a maga as her familiar slave in exchange for the promise not to harvest one of the covenant’s minor vis sources. When another covenant tries to gather the vis, however, the maga must protect it or break the bargain and lose her familiar. The folk hero of a nearby village was renowned for his skill as a healer, and his former possessions would be very useful to a Merinita with a similar interest, as they could be made into charms. Likewise, even mundane possessions of a famous magus like Ambrosius would likely fetch a high price among Merinitae folk magi. A pond is said to contain a magical fi sh that cannot be caught but speaks and has magical powers. The magi learn that it is the last of the descendants of an animal given intelligence many generations before by a lady in green. It threatens the magi, cursing them if they do not help it escape so that it can reproduce.''
