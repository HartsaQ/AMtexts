''Welcome to Mythic Africa! This continent, occupying a full quarter of our habitable zone, is mostly unexplored by Mythic Europeans — and, in fact, by most Mythic Africans as well. Sandwiched between the Great Desert to the south and the Mediterranean Sea to the north is a region just barely inhabitable by humans, or so it seems. Despite the hostile environment, some of the largest and furthest reaching dynasties known to the world have originated in Africa, and their descendants dwell here still. Herein are described the lands of Mythic Africa, as seen through the eyes of both Mythic Europeans and those who live here. This book can be used either for running stories where magi from Mythic Europe visit the mysterious continent across the sea, or as a setting for whole sagas with African characters. You will ﬁnd here details of the geography, customs, and legends from the Atlantic coast to the Siwa Oasis — the whole of Mythic Africa except for Egypt and Ethiopia. The lands of the Nile differ sufﬁciently from the rest of Africa to warrant separate treatment, and will be detailed in a future supplement for Ars Magica Fifth Edition.''

==The Shape of the World==

''The habitable zone in which Mythic Europe lies is a quarter of the sphere of the earth, divided by the meridian and the equator. It consists of three continents, and Africa is the one bounded by the Mediterranean sea to the north and''
''the River Nile to the east. The continent is named after the Roman province of Africa, a name preserved in the current Arab province of Ifriqiyeh. Its southern boundary is the Great Ocean that runs around the earth’s equator, and the western limit is the Atlantic Sea. The existence of the Great Ocean has been deduced from indisputable logic rather than directly observed, since it lies at the center of a belt of intense heat and stunning dryness called the torrid zone. The torrid zone is where the sun is closest to the earth, and it scorches the land directly around the equator. The northern limit of the torrid zone is a matter of debate, but most agree that it extends no further north than the Tropic of Cancer, and probably ceases well to the south of this limit. It is almost universally accepted by the Christian West and Arab scholars alike that Africa is limited to the northern side of the equator, that the equatorial ocean is unpassable, and that the torrid zone is uninhabitable. There have been expeditions into the fringes of the torrid zone both by land and by sea, and those who have returned have brought back stories of fabulous lands beyond the desert. Stories that might arise from entering the torrid zone are explored later in this book.''

==Themes==

''Mythic Africa has two dominant themes: wonder and hunger. To the natives, elements relating to either theme are so commonplace that they are rarely noticed or mentioned, but to outsiders these themes should stand''
''out. Storyguides introducing Mythic Africa into a saga may wish incorporate elements from one or both of these themes, particularly during the characters’ ﬁrst experiences on the continent.''

==A Note for Modern Readers==

''Some might be surprised to see that this book refers to a land called Africa, but covers only a fraction of the continent that currently bears that name. However, in the thirteenth century this was Africa, not North Africa. It was generally accepted that Africa had a southern shore on the Great Ocean somewhere north of the equator, but this had never been witnessed because the proximity of the sun to the equator formed a torrid zone that is hostile to all life. The black-skinned inhabitants of the continent are mostly Ethiopians who live on the fringes of the torrid zone. The historical empires and kingdoms of sub-Saharan Africa are relegated to legend, since in Mythic Africa they exist within or beyond the torrid zone. However, the border of the torrid zone is ill-deﬁned and need not be at a constant latitude throughout its extent. At the option of the storyguide there may be regions beyond the Great Desert that can support human life, or else these lands could lie within regiones. Art & Academe page 28 has a more complete discussion of the shape of the world in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, but pertinent material has been extracted here.''

''A Land of Wonder Africa is an exotic continent to Mythic Europeans. It is ﬁlled with outlandish beasts, strange spirits, and savage monsters. Further, it is the point of origin of one of Christendom’s biggest threats — the Moors of Al-Andalus in Iberia, an enemy that goes back half a millennium to the days of Charlemagne, originated in Mythic Africa. A European visiting the markets of Marrakesh will be overwhelmed by their strangeness; a welter of unusual smells, fabulous sights, and foreign sounds that he has never before encountered. Open plates are heaped high with fragrant spices, while at the next stall, impossibly-bright cloth ﬂutters in the wind. He might see a group of blemmyae — headless humans with faces on their chests — trading nuggets of raw gold, the bulging panniers of their camels guarded by savage looking dog-headed men, each ten feet tall and covered in black fur. Even at the edge of the desert, travelers experience heat like none they have experienced before save in a smith’s forge; the aridity consumes ﬂesh and saps willpower. It might seem that no''
''one could possibly live here, yet there are hidden oases and seasonal rivers that support pockets of hardy folk who seem to defy the savage dryness and heat. There are even some who dwell within the shifting dunes of the sand seas. An attack by diminutive raiders riding ostriches might be foiled by a group of Tuareg nomads who ride straight out of a desert mirage and disappear as quickly without saying a word. In the deep desert one’s sense of what is normal and what is strange is turned on its head. Distance and time seem to cease having true meaning; accidental travelers have reported visiting fabulous cities from ancient times, witnessing the congresses of demons, or speaking with angels.''

==A Land of Hunger==

''There is a spirit dwelling at the center of the Great Desert, a creature so mighty that it gives gods pause. It is the embodiment of the parching heat and the eroding winds, and seeks to consume everything, to suck all vitality out of the world, and leave nothing but dust''
''behind. The Romans called it the Fames Magna, the Berbers know it as Lazz, the Arabs Al-Ju’: all these names mean the same thing — The Great Hunger. Without opposition, the Great Hunger would parch the oases, stop the seasonal springs, cover the towns in sand, even grind down the mountains until there was nothing but dust from the equator to the Mediterranean Sea. But the Hunger has never been unopposed. In Ancient Egypt’s day, the spirit of the fertile black earth was invoked to guard against the sterile red spirit of the wastes. Carthage worshiped and obeyed its terrible gods in return for protection against the Great Hunger, and in those days its advance ceased — and even reversed. Some believe that the Romans were inﬂuenced by the Great Hunger when they destroyed Carthage and their gods, but were then forced to ﬁnd a power of appropriate strength to ward themselves against its all-consuming appetite. Today, the Dominion of God — ﬁrst Christian, now Muslim — forms a thin yet ﬁrm barrier to the ambitions of the Hunger. While it might seem foolhardy, some humans serve the interests of the Great''
''Hunger. The settuten (see Chapter 4: Realms) are a powerful group of nonHermetic magicians who have powers of dissolution and dissension. Their legendary progenitor is the Yemma-t n Dunnit, the First Mother of the World, who mythology suggests might be foremost amongst the Great Hunger’s servants.''

==Sagas in Mythic Africa==

''The wide expanse of Mythic Africa offers several reasons for magi to strike out to the frontier and for troupes to set a saga in this diverse and challenging environment. First, it presents a region of opportunity. Second, it offers a place of relative mundane and supernatural freedom. Third, Mythic Africa is a land of potential exploration, rife with lost ruins and magic places. From a metagame standpoint, Mythic Africa offers a great''
''opportunity for players looking for an alternate setting without going too far aﬁeld. Its exotic nature allows players to enjoy the roles of outsiders, taking a “vacation” from the familiar trappings of Mythic Europe. This can provide easy opportunities to explore themes, characters, and situations that would be illsuited to the Christian lands across the Mediterranean before returning home to their covenants.''

==Why Are There No Covenants in Mythic Africa?==

''Mythic Africa seems an intriguing possibility for young magi wishing to found a covenant. This leads them to wonder why the coast has not been settled before. There are several reasons why this may be the case, and one or more of these may be true in your saga.''
''THE CORDOVAN SAHIRS''
''At the beginning of the tenth century a schism developed in the Order of Solomon. The sahirs of Iberia and western Africa began to meet in Cordoba rather than making the arduous journey to Baghdad to meet with the rest of their order. The vast expanse of the desert was barrier enough, but it was also haunted by the settuten witches serving The Great Hunger who hated the sahir and who had the power to disrupt their magic. The Baghdad sahirs eventually repudiated the Cordovan sahirs and cast them from the Order of Solomon. In 925 most of the Cordovan sahirs joined the Order of Hermes (Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 133). One of the conditions of their joining was that no covenants would be founded in Mythic Africa for three centuries. The reason for this stipulation is not entirely understood. The new Hermetic sahirs may have been hiding from the jinn they had betrayed in joining the Order, or else it may have been imposed by the Hermetic negotiators to prevent the Order of Hermes from inheriting the settuten as enemies. If it suits the saga, this restriction on Maghrebi covenants may not have been strictly followed, and there may have been Hermetic covenants of questionable legality established in the past. Either way, the agreement expires in 1225, and at least some magi are eager to explore the new lands and the wonders therein.''
''THE EARLY ORDER WAS ROMAN IN ANCESTRY, BUT NOT LOCATION''
''The early Order’s members were mostly descended from Roman magi, but the demographic heartland of the organization they founded was in Germany. It expanded outward not from Rome, but from the Black Forest. Young magi wanting to settle could, and in many tribunals still can, ﬁnd suitable sites without the effort of colonizing Africa.''
''CHRISTIAN EUROPE IS BIGGER THAN IT USED TO BE''
''Another reason that magi have not settled Mythic Africa is that, there used''
''to be intervening Muslim territories between the core Tribunals and the Maghreb. Had the oldest magi now alive in the Order wanted to colonize Muslim lands in their youth, their covenants would have been in Sicily and Castille. Pope Innocent III called a crusade against the Muslims in Sicily only 21 years ago. Even in 1220, Western Sicily is effectively under the control of a Muslim warlord. If your game’s history follows that of the real world, Frederick II of Sicily will begin a series of campaigns to take back his kingdom in 1221. Magi looking for Roman ruins outside the core of the Order could ﬁnd them within Europe.''
''THE PATTERN OF UPRISINGS''
''Mythic Africa suffers infrequent waves of destruction, as uncompromising groups of nomadic Muslims emerge from the desert and destroy the opulent lives of agrarian people. These groups sometimes found new ruling dynasties, but many smaller groups merely shatter the economy of the region, for example by deliberately wrecking irrigation works. These groups despise material possessions, so they cannot be bribed for safety. Like most jihadis they seem to be protected by the Divine. Few magi have seriously considered settling Mythic Africa during these periods.''
''THERE MAY BE FAILED SETTLEMENTS''
''This supplement doesn’t detail any failed covenants in Mythic Africa, but troupes desiring them should include them.''

==Virgin Territory==

''The opportunity to establish a covenant without political rivalry for resources will likely hold great appeal for magi aware of the kind of contention evident in a tribunal like the Rhine, or tired of the situation in a resource-poor tribunal like Normandy. In almost every situation, the competition for vis sites or mundane resources in Mythic Africa only arises from Moorish or Berber''
''settlements and local hedge wizards or sahir. Certainly, there are occasional interactions with rare Trianomae or Seekers, but these are the exception rather than the rule. European Magi may experience prejudice from indigenous populations, but enjoy very few limitations on their responses beyond what they can actually negotiate or claim by force. The remote nature of the area may force a covenant to either recruit manpower from like-minded, adventurous souls across Mythic Europe willing to risk their fate, or establish alliances with local lords and tribes. An inﬂux of foreigners could rouse animosity from communities fearing invasion and attack. However a covenant might be uncomfortable forming long-term agreements with native groups, concerned about betrayal from within or irreconcilable cultural differences. The absence of an established Hermetic Tribunal in Mythic Africa means a covenant worries less about immediate claims of “mundane interference,” should the magi decide to act violently. However, this lack of Hermetic society also means a covenant is isolated from news and interaction from the rest of the Order, and may face long delays when calling for help or resupply. Additionally, Hermetic wizards in Africa might ﬁnd charges levied against them in European Tribunals, should their actions have consequences which spill across the Mediterranean and impact other covenants. The lack of an organized magical society in the region brings similar concerns. The sahir and hedge wizards of Mythic Africa may have no larger, formal structure, but that does not mean individuals of signiﬁcant supernatural power do not exist amongst their number. Stories from the seventh and eighth centuries mention the powerful sorceress known as the Kahina, who led the Berber tribes against Bedouin invaders. Certainly, the unregulated nature of Mythic Africa seemingly gives hawkish Hermetic magi carte blanche to prosecute magical warfare against a culture they may view as nonbelievers or heretics. However, this freedom comes with the realization that any expeditionary covenant is alone in their personal crusade against the locals. They need to balance their apparent magical''
''superiority, evident through the protection of the Parma Magica and the power of Hermetic magic, against the vast resources of native practitioners. Any sustained campaign of conquest and violence may galvanize sahirs, hedge wizards, and other local traditions like murabitin, the Tuareg tribes, or the Wind Spirits to unite against the Hermetic threat. Members of the Order may be free to wage war without political limitations, but the lack of a tribunal does not mean an absence of consequences. Additionally, they may ﬁnd further Hermetic repercussions when other magi follow their footsteps and encounter the hostile natives left in the characters’ wake. However, those missing political limitations provide magi with the chance to establish a covenant without the machinations of tribunal. There is no vote necessary prior to building or claiming a location. There is no Code dictating a covenant must be within a certain proximity of a vis site, like the Normandy Tribunal. There is no requirement for a new covenant to acquire the approval of previously established covenants, like the Rhine Tribunal. There is no need to participate in a social contract, like the Theban Tribunal. For a group comprised of only Muslim magi, the region promises a place devoid of the sort of internecine conﬂict which might be experienced in the Iberian or Levant Tribunals. The lands of Mythic Africa are wild and, for all intents and purposes, completely unsettled by the Order of Hermes. This means magi may freely seek desirable places for establishing a covenant where Divine auras are patchy and Magic auras are stronger. The vast area combined with the sparse populations means the Divine doesn’t often encroach on or affect a magus’ laboratory and magi can more readily ﬁnd Magic sites suited to their needs. Should investigation reveal a desirable Magic aura occupied by a less potent native sorcerer, a genius loci, or faerie creature, nothing prevents the magi from forcibly evicting the current owner and claiming the site for themselves. This sort of “conquest and seizure,” combined with relative mundane isolation, is much harder to ﬁnd in the Tribunals of Mythic Europe, where the Order has been active, in some places, for over 400 years.''
''NO CHURCHES''
''Even more so than the Order of Hermes, the Latin Church has nearly no presence in the Maghreb, allowing magi to establish a covenant without interference from the Church. There are no real abbeys or monasteries competing for land and craftsmen. The bulk of Mythic Africa’s Christians live in Tunis and there is a very small enclave further south in the Muslim-founded city of Kairouan. However, the situation still requires interaction with the Muslim faith, a situation which might not be readily apparent to European magi. The educated Muslim community is less given to superstition, and the Murabit tradition of the region means magi ex''
''perience less suspicion toward ascetic wisemen than they might see in Europe. No matter how tolerant the natives’ attitudes, the call to prayer helps establish the reach of Divine auras, and mosques are ubiquitous throughout the area.''
''A LAND FOR EXILES''
''Mythic Africa’s physical isolation and political ambiguity also offer magi a second chance to establish a covenant despite declarations of Wizard’s War or Wizard’s March. In this instance, characters exiled from the Order of Hermes might hide from the wrath of their former sodales by taking advantage of the difﬁcult terrain, hostile territory, and''
''numerous supernatural creatures. While such an existence has its risks, the relative proximity to the rest of Europe may mean the magi can build a new life while still pursuing attempts to clear their name or maintaining some connection to the relatives and loved ones left behind. These same links to the past, however, may serve to lead Hoplites and opportunists to destroy anything built in this inhospitable paradise.''

==Story Seeds==

''A number of initial story seeds might draw magi to Mythic Africa or engage them once they establish a covenant.''
''THE KAHINA’S LEGACY''
''The Kahina, or al-K?hinat, died ﬁghting with sword in hand against the Arab invasion in 703, at the age of 127. Her gift of foresight was no help, but it did ensure the survival of her line. Her Berber sons converted to Islam and led the Berber army into Iberia. Relics of her struggle against the Arabs, such as her sword, her veil, or pieces of her jewelry, may lie hidden in the many caves of the Atlas mountains, secreted away by loyalists afterward in order to prevent their capture by conquering armies. Any magus able to present such heirlooms to the locals, while claiming descent from the Kahina, would certainly face less opposition and might even be able to unite the more fractious Berber tribes. Is it possible her secrets hold the key to even more ancient magics from the region?''
''MUTING THE MUEZZIN''
''The power of the Divine often spreads as far as the prayers of the devout may be heard, and for a covenant near a settlement, the muezzin’s call could quickly dampen an otherwise strong Magic aura.''
''A clever covenant might ﬁnd a way to lay an enchantment or place a sufﬁciently powerful item which limits the muezzin’s song, keeping it audible only within the boundaries of the oasis and protecting their aura. Creating an item capable of affecting such a large area, then sneaking inside the Divine aura to appropriately place such an item so that it remains hidden but functional is no small endeavor. Additionally, if the Divine aura retreats, what will be left in its wake? Will the magi trade the difﬁculty of working under the shadow of the Divine for the troubles of an encroaching Infernal power, eager to exploit the new vacuum?''
''SEIZING THE SAHIR’S BOUNTY''
''There are few priests arriving from Europe to minister to a Christian population, beyond what the magi bring with them, until 1219, when St. Francis of Assisi dispatched a number of his order to proselytyie across the coast. In the ﬁrst weeks of 1220, Yusef II, Caliph of Morocco acted on the advice his sahir vizier, Abu Sa`id Uthman ibn Jam`i, and beheaded most of the friars. The group had befriended Princess Sancha of Alenquer when they passed through Portugal on their way to Morocco. In a vision she experienced while praying, the Princess saw the death of the missionaries. She''
''has offered a reward for the return of the Franciscans’ remains and suggested that anyone who brings proof of ibn Jam’i’s death might ﬁnd a great reward.''
''HUNTING THE HUNTED''
''The magi may arrive in the Maghreb while chasing the target of a Wizard’s March or a Wizard’s War, perhaps even a peer who has soured potential relations with the natives. After crushing the target’s defenses and dispatching any resistance, a group of magi may realize the beneﬁts of such a pre-established covenant location. However, they ﬁnd claiming the holding in the wilderness is more complicated than just moving in, as they discover that the local tribes, the genius loci, and the jinn all had agreements or grudges with the ostracized magus. With those agreements gone or the magi presumed to be the former occupant’s successors, what began as a rich source of loot and freedom could become a battle for survival.''
''WAGING WAR''
''The covenant’s activities threaten to create a nascent Order of Atlas, one bent on opposing the Order of Hermes. Trianoma magi come to dissuade the covenant with diplomatic entreaty. Hoplites actively but indirectly oppose them, attempting to''

==Between Sand & Sea The Spirit of Exploration==

''Finally, Mythic Africa is a land of exploration, presenting chances to claim both magical and mundane resources. The lost secrets of Antiquity lie relatively untouched in the wilderness and buried beneath the sands. Many places require but modest efforts to recover the artifacts of the Egyptians, Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Berber tribes, and ancient Garmantians. But unquiet spirits, magical creatures and meddling faeries mean pulling these fragments from the dust may prove to be the easy part. While the ruins and hidden places of Mythic Africa preserve''
''fragments of the past, the ports and souks offer ample opportunity to establish trade or communications as the Genoese maintain a bustling and jealously guarded exchange with ports on both sides of the Pillars of Hercules.''

==Logistical Difﬁculties==

''Any covenant establishing itself in Mythic Europe may face a variety of problems related to its remoteness from the heartlands of the Order. Magi are required to be members of one (and only one) tribunal. As it is so far outside traditional tribunal boundaries, a tribunal''
''might refuse to recognize the magi of an African covenant as members. Houses Mercere and Guernicus might oppose such a covenant, since their members would be required to travel periodically a great distance outside the bounds of the tribunal. An African covenant is equally likely to ﬁnd itself in the middle of a power struggle between two (or more) tribunals that wish to extend their borders to cover the new territory. These alternatives are not exclusive the characters may have difﬁculty gaining acceptance, but once they do, everyone wants to make a claim on them. If accepted as part of a tribunal (or perhaps as a requirement for that ac''

==Story Seeds (Cont’d)==

''destroy their resources. House Flambeau remains divided, as some see this as an action opening a welcome second front to the Reconquista, while others want to keep the enemy disorganized. Will Castra Solis support or hinder the covenant? Throughout it all, the native sorcerers and hedge wizards gather their forces for a confrontation which will reshape the Maghreb.''
''LOST SODALES''
''The magi don’t arrive on a mission of exploration, but tasked to discover the fate of a previous expeditionary covenant sent by the tribunal with the collected resources of several senior covenants and an important mission. What will they ﬁnd when they arrive at the expected location? Were the magi there overwhelmed by Tuareg tribesmen? Were their water sources fouled by the sandstorms of vindictive Wind spirits? Did a pack of bouda betray them from within? Or were they seduced by Infernal powers and convinced to abandon their task? Are survivors recovering in the depths of the Great Desert, or hiding in plain sight on the streets of Marrakesh? What happened to the ﬁrst covenant’s assigned task? Discovering the fate of not only the magi, but the invested devices, texts, and stores might take the newcomers from Rabat to Taghaza to Bilma to the ruins of Cyrene and still leave them with questions.''
''THE LONELY LIGHTHOUSE''
''The half-buried city of Leptis Magna is the home of an elder Verditius and dedicated Hermetic Architect and its lighthouse is his sanctum. In exchange for his services, the characters’ senior covenant members have struck a deal. The magi will travel to Cyrenaica and labor in Leptis Magna for ﬁve years, clearing the sands and repairing the Verditius’ covenant grounds while the Architect enchants their home in Mythic Europe. The Verditius has left a list of tasks and rules for his guests, and violating the contract might have tangled consequences. Will the characters quickly work to complete their end of the bargain, freeing them to explore Mythic Africa seemingly without concern, or will they leave the work for later? How will the region’s residents respond to their new neighbors? Will the former occupant’s reputation be protection from harassment, or did the cantankerous old wizard make enemies with powers intent on ruining his handiwork?''
''MYSTERIOUS SOURCES''
''The magi all belong to a Mystery Cult, like the Neo-Mercurians or Mithraists. Their mystagogue sends them as a chartered covenant to seek out relics of their cult or lost places of worship amongst the Roman ruins. In order''
''to progress deeper into the mysteries of their cult, they must establish a base of operations and not only thrive, but succeed in their hunt. What happens when a rival cult, such as the Disciples of the Worm, establishes a similar covenant, intent on plundering the characters’ secrets? How can they prove the theft of lost rites, and will the rivalry blossom into full-ﬂedged hostilities in lost ruins with few witnesses?''
''SEEKERS OF LOST MAGICS''
''The magi are members of the Seekers, looking for the lost magics of Carthage and the powers which allowed that far-ﬂung empire to oppose Rome through three conﬂicts over the course of almost 120 years. While the Republic eventually triumphed, there must be fragments and relics of those Punic traditions hidden in the ruins and wilds of the Maghreb, concealed by those who survived the legions’ conquest. The covenant arrives with the dedicated mission to unbury the long-dead corpse of the Carthaginan Empire and acquire its secrets for House Bonisagus and the Order. While they search, the magi might also discover the remnants of the Garamantians or delve into the local hedge traditions of the Berbers, looking for new magics worthy of incorporation into Hermetic Theory, like those of the settuten.''
''ceptance), the characters may have to make provisions for redcaps to visit them. This might require the characters to create an enchantment which allows the swift passage of redcaps to Mythic Africa, or perhaps even the funding of a Mercere’s Portal.''

==Hermetic Presence==

''In some sagas, troupes may prefer a light or nearly non-existent Hermetic presence in coastal Mythic Africa. This allows the troupe to focus on stories of exploration and colonization, rather than founding supply bases and maintaining contact with the order. This is particularly useful if the troupe’s stories are set deep in the desert. In this supplement, points of Hermetic settlement have been left undeﬁned. Troupes should apply any option which suits their stories to any of the cities in Mythic Africa, but future sourcebooks assume Mythic Africa has no Hermetic presence.''
''MERCERE TRADING HOUSE''
''Some sections of House Mercere are deeply involved in trade. When using this hook, the Mercere have warehouse and wharf space in one of the coastal cities. This option suits troupes who want their characters to have a ready source of local servants, guides who can explain local society, and aid to found a settlement on the trade routes. House Mercere tries not to use ﬂashy magic in Mythic Africa, so allied player characters will, similarly, be expected to maintain decorum.''
''JERBITON SCHOLARS''
''The madrasas of Mythic Africa beckon scholars from Europe, although few travel to them. Every so often, a young Jerbiton magus travels to Mythic Africa to attend one of these colleges or as part of an Itinerarium. A loose network of earlier Hermetic immigrants welcomes them. At times this network contains one magus per city; at others the magi form a small group, like a covenant, with the older magi acting as mentors for their younger sodales. This option''
''suits troupes interested in the political disintegation of Mythic Africa, and the efforts to defend the treasures of the region from looming civil war.''
''CRIAMON MYSTICS''
''House Criamon has had Suﬁ members for centuries. They form a small group considered less secretive than simply inscrutable to outsiders. They welcome visitors, particularly those willing to learn Enigmatic Wisdom. This option suits troupes who wish to visit a series of Suﬁ philosopher mystics and Murabits, complete their Ordeals, and learn their Mysteries or incorporate them into their own.''
''TREMERE SPIES''
''A few decades ago, the Primus of House Tremere asked House Mercere to scour Mythic Africa for Gifted children. This has created a generational cadre of magi who look Mythic African, and they have been dispatched to Mythic Africa to assess the region for threats or opportunities. This option suits troupes wanting to meddle with Mythic Africa society, surreptitiously control regions, and ferret out sources of power and opposition in the Maghreb.''

==The Land==

''Medieval Arabic sources refer to Africa (excluding Egypt) as Bilad alBarbar (“the land of the Berbers”) or else al-Maghrib (“The West”). Mythic Europeans still use Roman names on their maps, with an ill-deﬁned Gaetula for the center of the continent, and Ethiopia beyond that. Mythic Africa can be divided into four broad geographic areas. For clarity we have labeled these regions using the names used on medieval maps in order keep them distinct from the people or confederations that currently occupy the area. Three regions hug the coast of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas (from west to east):''
''Mauritania, Numidia, and Tripolitania–Cyrenaica. The Arabs call these regions the Farthest, Middle, and Nearest West respectively. They are the most settled parts of Africa, where temperate winds from the sea allow Mediterranean forests, woodlands and shrubs to ﬂourish. The fourth geographic area is the Great Desert, an exceptionally hot and arid region in the interior of the African continent, extending into the torrid zone. This section provides a brief geographic overview, which will be expanded in the following chapters.''

==Mauritania==

''Mauritania, or Al-Maghrib al Aqsa (“The Farthest West”) to the Arabs, occupies the Atlantic coast of Africa. The region is mostly a coastal desert; what plants grow here gain most of their moisture from the frequent fogs that roll in from the cooler sea. The cooling inﬂuence of the sea allow human habitation to extend south of the Tropic of Cancer. The Adrar highlands separate Mauritania from the blasting heat of the desert further west.''

==Numidia==

''The region of Numidia boasts the highest population density of all of Africa, excepting Egypt. Called AlMaghrib al Awsat (“The Middle West”) in Arabic, this region has a coastal Mediterranean climate thanks to the sheltering inﬂuence of the Atlas Mountains. Rather than a single range, the Atlas Mountains are actually a series of ranges; between the Tell Atlas on the coast and the barrier ranges of the Anti-Atlas, High Atlas, and Saharan Atlas further south are crop lands and pasture. The key populated areas are: Er Rif, a mountainous area between the Middle Atlas and the Straits of Gibraltar; the Tell, a high altitude plateau south of the Tell Atlas; and Ifriqiyeh in the Aures Mountains.''

==Between Sand & Sea Cyrenaica and Tripolitania==

''Cyrenaica is the region immediately east of Egypt (thus the Arabic name of al-Maghrib al Adna, “The Nearest West”), whereas Tripolitania is the name given to the coastal region around the Gulf of Sidra to the north of the Libyan Desert. This is a poorly populated area, occupied mostly by the nomadic Banu Sulaym.''

==The Great Desert==

''The Great Desert (in Arabic As-Sahra al-Kubra, whence “Sahara”) is a vast area of largely uninhabited land that occupies the majority of the known land mass of Africa. Labeled “Gaetula” on medieval maps, most westerners are under the mistaken impression that it is just a single wasteland of sand. This is only really true of the ergs, or sand seas, broad ﬂat areas of windswept sand that forms into dunes. There are several ergs of vast size in the Great Desert, notably the Grand Erg south of the Atlas Mountains; the Great Sand Sea, the Ubari and Murzuq Deserts of Libya; and the Erg Chech and El Djouf east of Mauritania. Ergs generally have no human inhabitants. Outside of the ergs, most of the Great Desert consists of stony desert called regs, and vast rock plateaus called hamada. Salt ﬂats dot areas in the shelter of mountains. The Tademaït Plateau south of the Grand Erg is a hamada of unparalleled ﬂatness. It is truly empty, free from hills, villages, and animals. There aren’t even any stones or pebbles, just an expanse of dust. The occasional bush manages to eke out a living, and these give welcome relief to eyes tired of seeing nothing but ground and sky. Tademaït deservedly has the reputation for being a haunt of jnun, and men have been driven mad by the emptiness. The Tademaït Plateau ﬁnally comes to an end at mountains to the south west, and Tuat to the south east. Tuat contains a string of small oases strung out along the eastern edge of a dry valley called a wadi, which forms an important route for travelers seeking to cross the desert.''
''MOUNTAIN RANGES''
''A number of mountain ranges can be found in the Great Desert; the most prominent are the Ahaggar Mountains (Berber: idurar n Ahaggar) at the very center of the desert. Forming the northeast border of the Ahaggar Mountains is the Tassili n Ajjer (Berber, meaning “Plateau of the Rivers”), a panoramic region of “rock forests” made of eroded sandstone. South of the Ahaggar is the Adagh in the east and the triangular massif of the Aïr Mountains in the west.''
''LIBYAN DESERT''
''The Libyan Desert is on the southern and eastern border of Cyrenaica. The Great Sand Sea occupies much of the desert, with the Ubari and Murzuq ergs forming the southwestern region. The Al-Haruj al-Aswad is a plateau of black rock rising out from the sand of the Murzuq Desert crowned by volcanic craters. Beyond the Great Sand Sea, on the border of the torrid zone, are the Tibesti Mountains. These are the highest mountains of the Great Desert; the tallest peak is Emi Koussi at over eleven thousand feet. Their name means “the Mountains of Hunger” in the local dialect.''
''TANEZROUFT''
''Tanezrouft (Berber: “Land of Thirst”) is the most desolate part of the Great Desert. It lies to the west of the Ahaggar Mountains, south of Tuat. There are no oases in Tanezrouft at all, making it exceptionally dangerous to travelers, giving them a taste of what the torrid zone is like. Tanezrouft is a region of dark sandstone hills riddled with steep canyon walls rising 250 to 500 paces in between dune ﬁelds. The blasting wind has scoured out geometric patterns from the sandstone, making hollows in the shape of perfect concentric ellipses or circles.''

==The Torrid Zone and Beyond==

''The torrid zone has an ill-deﬁned border within the Great Desert. Some scholars talk of the torrid zone as a “ring of ﬁre,” as if it were a precise geographic border; if this is the case then it occurs further south than most travelers can reach. Throughout most of its length the torrid zone exists as an intensiﬁcation of the heat and aridity of the desert. Deprivation rolls for thirst (see Chapter 3, The Great Desert, “Hazards of the Desert”) increase to a two-hourly interval, and the sunlight on bare skin inﬂicts +5 non-combat damage over the same period. There are no known''

==What if I Don’t Want Characters to Cross the Torrid Zone?==

''Some storyguides might want the torrid zone to be an impermeable barrier that keeps the characters on the right side of the equator, and this can be an edict enforced by the power of the Divine. This is something that should be discussed with the players so that they know the bounds of the world in the saga; however, it needn’t stiﬂe the curiosity of the characters. As characters enter the torrid zone, a magus might expect to be able to ameliorate or negate the effects of heatstroke and sunburn, but could ﬁnd himself unable to do so in the torrid zone. If the damaging heat and light derive from the proximity of the sun, they are products of the superlunar world, and therefore beyond the reach of Hermetic magic. Insights into research concerning the Limit of the Lunar Sphere could be productive in the torrid zone. As the characters penetrate deeper, the heat becomes more and more intense, and eventually overcomes even the strongest of defenses. Magic used to overcome the effects of the Divine edict fails, perhaps spectacularly. Furthermore, the torrid zone could be patrolled by angels who turn away any who attempt to cross.''

''sources of water within the torrid zone; characters must bring with them whatever they want to drink. The torrid zone is inhospitable in the extreme, but it is not necessarily homogeneous. There could be regions which can sustain life and give some surcease from the heat, and those creatures who live in the desert are likely to know where they are. These areas may lie within Magic or Faerie auras or regiones, and may be connected to the regio network of the Great Desert. According to medieval maps, Aethiopia (or Ethiopia) lies to the south of the Great Desert; Aethiopia Orientalis is located to the south of Egypt, and Aethiopia Occidentalis is south of Mauritania. Aethiopia borders on the equatorial ocean. Whether this Aethiopia is the same as the torrid zone, or whether it is a separate land, is a matter for the saga to decide. Some other ideas of what might lie within the torrid zone include:''
''• A city built by refugees from Rome’s sack of Carthage, now ruled by a college of priestesses who masterminded the escape; • The Empire of Prester John: a land of tranquility and prosperity ruled by a Christian king; • Vast grasslands and dark jungles where tribes of nomadic pastoralists herd cattle and antelope in service of a race of sphinxes; • A river of gemstones and vis that ﬂows through a maze of black ravines capable of trapping the ghost of any who die there; • Aithiopia Occidentalis may be the true home of the Sudanese.''
''Logic dictates that there is another habitable zone on the other side of the equator, a twin to our own on this side of the meridian, but that it is forever unreachable due to the Great Ocean. Some have theorized that this might be the physical location of the Magic Realm.''

==History==

''Mythic Africa’s history stretches back far into antiquity, when it was the home of giants and non-human races. In historical records, Mythic Africa rose to prominence in the days of Carthage.''

==Antaios and Tinjis==

''In the time of legends, the giant Antaios (Antaeus to the Romans, Änti to the Berbers) used to dwell within Libya’s desert. The giant was gradually building a temple to his father Poseidon out of the skulls of those he defeated in a wrestling match. He drew his might from his mother, the earth itself, and had her limitless strength. Herakles happened upon Antaios while on his way to his eleventh labor, the Apples of the Hesperides. He held the giant aloft during their match, severing him from the earth and leaving him as weak as a mortal. Herakles then crushed the giant’s ribcage. Herakles took Antaios’s wife Tinjis to bed, and fathered on her Sufax, who is the mythic ancestor of the Berber people. Sufax built the city of Tangier, which he named after his mother, and from here took over Antaios’s role as guardian of the country of the Berbers.''

==Carthage and the Romans==

''The Phoenician princess Dido founded the city of Carthage in 814 BC. At the height of the city’s power it controlled a mighty trading empire that stretched from the Gulf of Sidra to the Atlantic Sea, and had colonies in Spain, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Meanwhile, Greek settlers controlled the eastern Maghreb, along the coast of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, and built on the strength of Egypt following its conquest by Alexander the Great. Several Berber kingdoms emerged at this time and developed trading partnerships with Carthage. The greatest of these were''
''Numidia and Mauritania. During the second Punic War, two Numidian kings took opposing sides: Suphax of the western Masaesyli sided with Rome, and Gala of the eastern Massylii tribe sided with Carthage. Gala’s successor Massinissa sided with Rome, judging that they were winning; and Suphax allied with Hasdrubal, Carthaginian general and brother of Hannibal. Carthage was eventually destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC, and while the city itself was destroyed and its ﬁelds salted, the Roman empire claimed its territory for itself, creating the Province of Africa. Massinissa was given all of Numidia, surrounding Carthage and extending to the south east as far as Cyrenaica. By 112 BC, Massinissa’s grandson Jugurtha was at war with Rome. Failing to gain a decisive victory, the Romans forged links with neighboring Mauritania, with whose help Jugurtha was captured in 104 BC. Western Numidia was added to Mauritania; the remainder was governed by local princes. In the ﬁrst century AD Emperor Claudius divided Mauritania into two provinces, Mauritania Caesariensis and Mauritania Tingitana. The Roman provinces in northern Africa were very prosperous and its inhabitants became Romanized, acquiring citizenship and speaking Latin. Christianity spread quickly through the Roman Mauri, producing several important theologians including Tertullian, Cyprian, and Augustine. However, as the power of Rome faded in the fourth century, the northern African provinces became susceptible to heresies such as Arianism, Pelagianism, Donatism, and Montanism. The Berber tribes of the interior continued with their old way of life untouched by Roman influence beyond providing tribute and auxiliary troops for the great Roman army.''

==Vandals and Byzantines==

''In 422 the Vandals raided Mauritania Tingitana. Sensing trouble, Rome’s Comes Africae (military governor of Africa) invited the Vandals under Gaiseric into northern Africa with the intent to conﬁne them there, but they rejected any attempt to control them. These provinces were lost''
''to the empire until the province of Africa was reconquered by the Byzantine general Belisarius in 522. The western territory was lost to the Mauri, and never brought under Byzantine control. The Maghreb was too vast to be controlled from Constantinople; the empire was already weak thanks to wars with Persia. The Byzantines concentrated their efforts in Mythic Africa on the coastal towns, and used the rivalries between the local chiefs to prevent a general insurrection. As in the time of the Romans, the interior remained untouched by Byzantine inﬂuence; the dominant tribes of the Luwata (in the east), Sanhaja (in the west and center), and Zenata (in the south and south-west) controlled most of Mythic Africa.''

==The Arab Invasion and the Berber Uprising==

''When the ﬁrst incursions from Umayyad Egypt extended into Cyrenaica in 642, the Byzantines bribed them to leave. They returned in 670 led by''
''‘Uqbah ibn Naﬁ, who founded the city of al-Qayrawan as his base of operations. From Ifriqiyeh (the Roman Province of Africa), ‘Uqbah extended Arab rule over the whole of the Maghreb. In 683 he was slain by a Berber tribal chief named Kusayla, who vigorously opposed the Arab invasion. Under Kusayla, and later the Kahina (see Insert), the Berbers held out against the Arabs for twenty years. Umayyad wizards brought in to oppose native sorcerers found their spirits abandoned them when faced by Berber magic. The defeat of the Berbers came at their own hand: the Arab generals seduced certain Berber tribes with promises of rich rewards and choice territory. These new converts to Islam swelled the ranks of the Arab armies sufﬁciently to ﬁnally defeat the Berber resistance in 711. The Arabs did not stop there, and under General Tariq ibn Ziyad the mostly Berber army swept into southern Spain and conquered the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania. By 720 the Umayyad wizards were ﬁghting a full-scale magical war in Africa against the rebellious jinn who has once served them; goaded by Berber''

==The Kahina==

''The Kahina (Arabic: al-Kahinat, “the seeress”) was a Berber chief who fought against the Arabs in the seventh century. Her given name was Dihya: she acquired her epithet from her opponents who ascribed her military success to her ability to foresee the future. After taking over the resistance in the 680s she led the Berbers in several very successful campaigns, driving out the Arabs from Ifriqiyeh and keeping them besieged in Cyrenaica for over ﬁve years while she laid the land to waste. This lost her the support of the oasis dwellers who relied on the land she despoiled, and who felt this demonstrated her bias toward the mountain and desert tribes. With her support wavering, the ﬁnal nail in her cofﬁn was her betrayal by her adopted son to the Arab leaders. She died in battle, sword in hand, at the age of 127 years old. Part of the Kahina’s power was attributed to an idol of Gurzil, the Berber god of war. Inherited from the days of Jugurtha, she had the idol carried into''
''every battle with her. Some believe that her adherence to Gurzil indicated that she was a settut, which would certainly explain her divinatory powers.''
''STORY SEED: THE GOLDEN IDOL OF GURZIL''
''Khalid ibn Yazid, the treacherous adoptive son of the Kahina stole Gurzil’s idol prior to her ﬁnal battle, perhaps explaining her defeat. His descendants were forced to leave the idol behind in alAndalus when they migrated to their new homeland, but they would dearly love to have it back. The characters learn of its current whereabouts from a disreputable merchant who also sells the information to a faction within the Banu Khalida. It is a race to see who can get their hands on it ﬁrst: if it is the Banu Khalida, then it could have dire consequences for the stability of the Almohads.''

|]
''magic the spirits managed to drive the wazirs back east. In Africa, the governors appointed by the Umayyad caliphs were quick to enforce Arab dominance over the Berbers through discrimination and slavery. Discontent was rife, and there was widespread revolt in 739. This uprising was united under Kharijite Islam; this sect had been ﬁghting Umayyad dominance in Egypt, and its doctrines promoted egalitarianism that appealed to the independent Berbers. The timing of the revolt was fortunate; combined with the death of the caliph and a revolt in Egypt, the Umayyad dynasty collapsed under the pressure.''

==The Dissident Dynasties==

''When the Abbasids — who succeeded the Umayyads — came to the Maghreb, they discovered three centers of political authority had appeared in the vacuum left, and all rejected the political authority of the caliph. Two were Kharijite sects, the Rustamids in Tahart and the Banu Midrar in Sijilmasa. The third dynasty, the Idrisids of Fes, were Sunni but had fought on the side of the Shi’ites against the Abbasids. The Rustamids arose from a small tribe called the Banu Ifran who were under al-Kahina’s leadership. The founder Abdul-Rustam ibn Rustam was of Persian descent, and he established a theocratic government where imams were elected to rule over a confederation of Ibadite Berber tribes. They gained a reputation for honesty and piety, and fostered support for astronomy, mathematics, and theology. However, they neglected to organize a reliable army, which proved their downfall against the Fatimids. The Banu Midrar made Sijilmasa a cosmopolitan city occupied by Sanhaja Berbers from the desert, Jews, Andalusians, Berbers, and Arabs, as well as exotic men with coal-black skin, dog-headed men, and other wonders. The kingdom was known for its religious tolerance and peacemaking; only toward the Idrisids in the north was hostility shown. The Idrisid Dynasty was an Arab dynasty that followed Sunni Islam, and therefore could get little support from''
''Berbers. It is thanks to the Idrisids that the northwest region of Africa remains mostly Arab to this day. The Idrisids failed to conquer a people called the Barghawata on the Atlantic coast despite numerous attacks. An early ruler of this Berber confederation had claimed prophecy for himself and composed a holy book in the Berber language. He then proceeded to convert his people to a Berber religion of his own making. The heresy was eventually stamped out by the Almoravids (see later). Faced with hostile neighbors, the caliph could exert only limited control over Africa. The embassy at Qayrawan established by Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab effectively ruled independently as the Aghlabid dynasty. From 903 to 909, the Aghlabids suffered one military defeat after another against Abu ‘Abdulla, a Yemeni missionary of the Isma’ili sect of Islam. He had been sent by the Isma’ili leaders in Syria to raise an army against the Abassids, and had managed to convert the Kutuma tribe of Sanhaja Berbers to his cause. After conquering Kairouan and Ifriqiyeh, he marched on Tahart and crushed the peaceful Rustamids before moving on to the Banu Midrar stronghold of Sijilmasa. In 909 the leader of the Isma’ilis, ‘Ubaydalla Sa’id, came to the Maghreb and took over the new Fatimid Dynasty from his protege Abu ‘Abdulla. Within two years Abu ‘Abdulla and his family had been murdered by the ruthless leader. The Fatimids persuaded the native magicians, the settuten, of their Kutuma allies to apply their talents to the struggle against the Abassids. Many Arab sahirs were driven out of Africa by the settuten, who were capable of disrupting magical abilities, banishing spirits, and fomenting rebellion amongst the summoners’ jinn allies. Africa gained a reputation of being hostile to the Order of Solomon, a reputation it retains today. Despite Abassid attempts to destabilize the Fatimid regime, by 969 the Fatimids had conquered Egypt. The city of Cairo was founded to be the new Fatimid capital, and the administration of the empire left the Maghreb. A Berber, Buluggin ibn Ziri, was chosen by the Fatimids to be governor of the Maghreb, and his capable administration soon established the Berber Zirid family as the ruling dynasty of northern Mythic Africa.''
''THE BANI HILAL''
''Fatimid authority in Egypt was threatened by an anarchic community of Arab bedouin clans that had grown through migration from other nomad tribes and from peasants seeking to escape debt and servitude. Before he was really aware of it, the caliph was facing over a quarter of a million individuals and at least 50,000 young warriors at the disposal of the clan chiefs. At the advice of his ministers, Caliph al-Mustansir requested the help of these clans in quelling the rebellion of the Zirid emirs, offering them governor positions in the conquered territory for their efforts. In 1051 the great nomad horde migrated west under the name of the Bani Hilal (“the children of the crescent moon”). Some occupied Cyrenaica, but the majority continued west, overwhelming whatever resistance the Zirids could offer. They were not interested in investing the towns and cities; instead they took possession of the grazing grounds at the edge of the desert. The Zirids attempted to treat with them, but the great migration had no leader, and the Zirids had nothing that they wanted. Some individual chiefs reluctantly accepted the suzerainty and judgments of the Zirid rulers, but the Bani Hilal were impossible to tax, and the town-based culture of the interior was destroyed in one fatal stroke of the Fatimid caliph. With his authority disintegrating, the Zirid emir retreated from Qayrawan to Mahdia on the coast, leaving the interior to the Bani Hilal. Northern Mythic Africa reverted to a patchwork of local Berber lordships, interspersed with the militant presence of nomadic Arab clan chiefs. The society of the steppe and plateaus of the Atlas mountains became mostly Arabic-speaking pastoralism rather than Tamazight-speaking agriculture.''

==The Almoravids==

''The al-Murabitun movement, also known as the Almoravid Dynasty, arose from a zealot of the Sanhaja Berber called Abdallah ibn Yasin. He was from the Gazzula tribe, but his brand of orthodox Islam went down poorly amongst his own people. He was invited to preach to the Lamtuna tribe by their chieftain Yahya''
''ibn Umar, who desired to refound the Sanhaja union, and saw ibn Yasin’s mission to spread the Sacred Law as a useful tool to force the tribes to put aside their rivalries and unite under a single banner. Under the twin leadership of Ibn Yasin and Ibn Umar, the al-Murabitun movement began its inexorable conquest of the Maghreb in the early 1050s. A decisive victory in 1054 brought them the town of Sijilmasa, at the northern end of the desert trade route. By 1062 the Almoravid leader Yusuf ibn Tashﬁn had founded the city of Marrakesh, and from here he spread his inﬂuence over the entire Atlas range. In 1086, Yusuf ibn Tashﬁn was invited by the Muslim princes of al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula to assist them against the Christian king of León and Castile. Having seen the disunity of the Andalusian princes and the discontent of the people, he returned a few years later, and by 1094 he had conquered all Muslim territory in Iberia except Zaragoza, and added the united al-Andalus to the Almoravid empire. The successes of ibn Tashﬁn were not to persist long past his death. His son and successor Ali ibn Yusuf had not experienced the harsh life of his desertdwelling predecessors, but had grown up in the luxury of Marrakesh. His father’s empire was eroded by the Christian kings of Iberia and the Almohads in Africa (see later). Just four years after Ali ibn Yusuf’s death in 1143, Marrakesh was taken by the Almohads and the dynasty was at an end.''

==The Almohad Caliphate==

''Like the Almoravids, the Almohads (al-Muwahhidun, “the monotheists”) began as a religious movement. Ibn Turmart of the Masmuda confederation had studied in Grenada and Baghdad, where he developed his doctrine of the strict unity of God, denying the independent existence of separate attributes of the Deity. He returned to the Maghreb in 1117, and agitated against the Almoravids, gathering a following and erected a fortress at Tinmel in the High Atlas. For eight years he harried the road linking Marrakesh to Sijilmasa whilst making alliances with more tribes and growing in strength. Their ﬁrst proper battle was a failed siege of Marrakesh in 1130 which ended in disaster for the Almohads. Ibn Turmart died a few months later, but his death seemed to merely encourage his followers. Abd al-Mu’min took over the movement and was successful in driving out the Almoravids in a series of victories, and by 1147 had extended control of Africa as far as Egypt. Al-An''
''dalus was gradually conquered from the Almoravids between 1147 and 1173. The current Almohad caliph is Yusuf al-Mustansir, who was just ten years old when his father died in 1213, and the caliphate is still largely under the control of the regency council put in place then.''

==The People of Mythic Africa==

''Africa does not in general consist of feudal states with clear national boundaries. Rather, each village is a member of a tribe, and the tribal leaders form confederations that usually generate or support a ruling dynasty. Currently, most of northern Mythic Africa is part of the Almohad confederation, whose rulers are Berbers.''

[|

==The Marinids==

''The Ayt Mrin (Arabic Banu Marin) is a dynasty of Zenata Berbers. They have battled with the ruling Almohads since the very beginning, but in 1217 they won a decisive victory in the Rif, despite losing their leader Abd al-Haqq. His son Uthman ibn Abd has secured control of Er-Rif, and is looking to extend his inﬂuence over more of Africa. The Almohads have counterattacked in vain, and have even fortiﬁed their Iberian cities against a possible Marinid attack.''

|]

==Between Sand & Sea Berbers==

''The Berbers (or Imazighen, singular Amazigh) are the aboriginal people of Africa, and a Berber dynasty currently rules most of the Maghrib. They are divided into three tribal confederations: Zenata, Masmuda, and Sanhaja.''
''MASMUDA''
''The Masmuda are found mostly in the north west around Fes and Rabat, amongst the western Atlas Mountains and around Sijilmasa. Ibn Tumart, who founded the Almohad dynasty, was a Masmuda, and this confederation currently dominates the Almohad hierarchy. Masmuda subtribes include the Barghwata, Ghomara, Doukkala, and Hintata. Ifriqiyeh is currently ruled by Masmuda governors from the Hafsid''
''dynasty on behalf of the Almohads.''
''SANHAJA''
''The Sanhaja now occupies two geographically distinct regions. The eastern Sanhaja, which includes the Kutama tribe, are found in the eastern Maghreb on the Tademaït Plateau and Ahaggar Mountains. The western Sanhaja occupy Mauritania: the Gazzula and Lamta tribes in the Anti-Atlas range, the Massufa, Lamtuna and Banu Warith further south, and most southerly on the edge of the torrid zone is the Gudala. The Sanhaja Berbers formed the nuclei of the Almoravid, Zirid, and Hammadid dynasties.''
''ZENATA''
''The Zenata are distributed throughout the Tell and northern Numidia. There is great rivalry between the Zenata (who were allied with the Caliphate of Cordoba) and the Sanhaja, who were allies of the Fatimids. The Marinids of Er-Rif are a Zenata tribe, as are the Banu Zayan (or Abd al-Wadids) who are gathering power in Tlemcen.''

==Arabs==

''The Arabs arrived in Mythic Africa in two major waves: the Umayyids in the eighth century and the Banu Hilal in the eleventh. The invasion by the Umayyid Caliphate in the eighth century resulted in the building of cities and the subjugation of native Berbers, leading to a city-dwelling Arab upper class''

[|

==African Languages==

''The following Living Languages, each with distinct regional dialects, are spoken in the Maghreb and northwestern Africa. Most characters should take the appropriate dialect as a specialty but Educated or well-travelled speakers will have tried hard to rid themselves of their dialect and may have standard specialties (see ArM5, page 66).''
''Arabic (Andalusi, Classical, Derija) Tamazight (Tariﬁt, Kabyle, Tashelhiyt, Zenaga, Tamahak, Siwi) Lingua Franca (Sabir) (Western, Eastern) Punic (Khalidan)''
''The most common Arabic dialect spoken throughout Mythic Africa and by those Arabized Berbers that have migrated across the straits is Derija (Maghrebi Arabic). Classical Arabic remains the language of secular scholarship, original poetry and the Qur’an but is rarely spoken in common day conversations. An Artes Liberales score of 1 and an Arabic (Classical) score of 3 is required to read from the Qur’an. The true Berber language, known as Tamazight to its speakers, has divided into three main dialects over time: Tariﬁt (Maghreb and Rif), Kabyle (modern''
''Algeria region) and Tashelhiyt (central highlands). Zenaga is a fourth dialect spoken by the tribes of south-west Mauritania and was the primary tongue of the warriors of the Almoravid Empire. Siwi is an eatsern dialect spoken only by the inhabitants of the Siwah oasis. Contemporary Berber speakers and the Tuareg still use the Tiﬁnagh (Libyan) alphabet, although more recently the Arabic alphabet has been substituted particularly in the coastal Muslim enclaves with their Arab dominated culture. Also known as Sabir, lingua franca, the pidgin trade tongue of the Mediterranean, is the most common language spoken by visitors from Mythic Europe, although many of the foreigners speak their native languages (French, Greek, Italian, Occitan, and Veneto) in the company of their own people. Tamahak is the less common dialect of the Tuareg tribes of the deep south and is less closely related than the other northern dialects. The southern Banu Khalida speak their own language, an early dialect similar to Punic combined with a mixture of archaic Arabic and Tamazight.''
''Descendents of Berber families involved in the initial invasion of Visigothic Hispania speak predominantly Arabic — only the warriors and religious hierarchs of the newer Almoravid and Almohad waves speak Berber as their primary tongue and many have a limited ﬂuency in Arabic, equivalent to a Arabic (Classical) score of 3, which permits basic understanding of the Qur’an and the sermons of the clerics. Many dhimmi encountered in the Maghreb use the Andalusi dialect of Arabic learnt in Iberia but the lingua franca (Western dialect) and the various languages of the merchant republics can be heard being spoken by visiting Europeans in the coastal cities. Arabic and the Tamazight dialects spoken in the north use the Arabic script, but the Tuareg and southern Berbers use their own Tiﬁnagh alphabet. The Punic dialect spoken by the Banu Khalida uses a variant of the ancient Phoenician cuneiform alphabet.''
''DEAD LANGUAGES''
''Lost to the past, several Dead Languages brought by invaders to the region no longer have living speakers but''

|]
''dominating the rural Berber underclass in the coastal regions, while the interior remained predominantly Berber. This situation persisted until the Almoravid dynasty took control of the region: this Berber political movement placed its own in positions of power.''
''BANU HILAL AND ALLIES''
''The Banu Hilal are confederation of Bedouin tribes from the Upper Nile who arrived in Mythic Africa in the eleventh century. Their arrival destroyed the power of the Arab Zirid dynasty, and severely weakened the Hammadids. Before the arrival of the Banu Hilal there was a distinct separation between Arab and Berber, but the nomadic Banu Hilal have brought the Arabic language into traditionally Tamazight regions, along with Sunni Islam and nomadism. The Maqil accompanied the Banu Hilal on their invasion of the Maghreb.''
''They originated in Yemen, and consisted of several sub-tribes; the most important being the Banu Hassan, after whom the Hassaniya variety of Arabic is named. They settled in the far west beyond the High Atlas Mountains, although some remained in Ifriqiyeh with their sahirs, who became advisers to the Banu Hilal. The Banu Sulaym originated in Nejd and Hejaz and followed the Banu Hilal and Maqil westwards. The Banu Hebib tribe of the Banu Sulaym settled in Cyrenaica, whereas the ‘Awf, Debbab, and Zegb tribes settled west of them in Tripolitania and the fringes of Libyan Desert. After a century of feuding and civil war, the Debbab eventually came out as the dominant tribe.''

==Others==

''The Ayyubid Sultanate founded by Saladin currently controls Egypt, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, as well as much of the Arabian Peninsula. They rule the region from Tripoli. The rulers set in place over Cyrenaican cities are Kurdish in origin, and supported by Bedouin and Turkish forces.''
''BANU KHALIDA''
''The Banu Khalida occupy twelve oases in the very south of Mauritania. They live further into the torrid zone than any other human race. They have seemingly limitless quantities of gold, and are blessed with well-irrigated soil and a temperate microclimate for their cities despite the blasting heat of their surrounds.''

==African Languages (Cont’d)==

''inscriptions carved on ruins can be found throughout the wastes. Carthaginian is the classical Punic dialect spoken by the western Phoenician colonies that later formed the empire of Carthage but is now found only on inscription or uttered by the ghosts of the destroyed empire. Libyan refers to the pre-Punic languages of the Numidians and other tribes encountered by the ﬁrst Carthaginian settlers and their Roman conquerors.''
''East German (Gothic, Vandalic) Greek (Classical) Latin (Classical) Libyan Punic (Carthaginian, Phoenician)''
''The German scripts use the Gothic alphabet and the Punic dialects uses the original Phoenician script. Ancient Libyan uses a cuneiform script resembling the Phoenician alphabet and bearing a deﬁnite resemblance to the Tiﬁnagh alphabet still used by the Tuareg.''
''DIALECTS''
''The various Berber groups speak related dialects, although some speakers may ﬁnd making themselves intelligible difﬁcult if they speak one of the more isolated tongues.''
''Same language, different dialects:  –1 penalty to both speakers  Tamazight (northern dialects) vs Tamahak dialect –2 penalty to both speakers Tamazight (including Tamahak) vs Punic (Khalidan) –3 penalty to both speakers Punic vs Libyan  –2 penalty to both speakers''
''The other languages are so distinct from each other that comprehension is likely to be based on signing and good guesswork, or magic. Example: Jarfuret the Khalidan (see later) with Punic 5 (Khalidan) speaks to a fellow Khalidan with an effective score of 6, Punic-speaking demons with no dialect with an effective score of 5, Carthaginian or Phoenician ghosts with an effective''
''score of 4, ancient Libyan ghosts with an effective score of 3, and can hold a basic conversation with northern Berbers and Tuareg (effective score 2). He cannot however make himself understood to Arabic speakers or northern characters without using some form of magic.''
''A NOTE ON PRONUNCIATION''
''While Tamazight grammar has its own rules for pluralizing nouns, it is a common convention in western writing to indicate the plurals of many words by simply adding s (e.g. Tuaregs). That is the convention used (with a couple of exceptions) throughout this book. As a (very approximate) pronunciation guide: c is pronounced ch as in “church,” i is pronounced ee as in “meat,” q as k in “kiss,” u as in “mood,” v is pronounced f as in “free,” ny is nye as in “mañana,” kh as in Scottish “loch,” sy as in “shield,” nng as in “bingo.” Other pronunciations are as normal for English with rare exceptions. Similar guidelines for the pronunciation of Arabic words are given in Realms of Power: the Divine Revised Edition, page 107.''

|]
''TUAREG''
''The Tuareg are a nomadic people sharing a common origin with the Berbers. They roam the breadth of Great Desert, and probably know it better than anyone else.''
''NON-HUMAN RACES''
''Africa is home to a fair number of different kinds of Magic Humans, such as the headless Blemmyae, the dogfaced Cynocephali, and the childsized Tripithami. In general these do not mix with normal humans except in large cities, but encounters with them are not uncommon.''

==Muslim Names==

''Traditional Muslim names consist of some or all of a number of elements:''
''1. Ism: The name given at birth. This may be an Arabic name, the Qur’anic form of a biblical name, a compound name consisting of “’Abd” (servant of) plus one of the names of God (among men; women might use “Amat” in place of “Abd,” but this is much less common), or a non-Arabic name. 2. Nasab: Pedigree. The nasab in Arabic consists of “ibn” (son of) or “bint” (daughter of), followed by either the father’s ism or a family ism. The similar Tamazight equivalent used by Berber men is “ag” but there is no female equivalent. 3. Kunya: This is the term “abu” (father of) or “umm” (mother of), preﬁxed to either the name of a child or an attribute, acquired either upon becoming a parent or as an epithet. This may appear before the ism or after the nasab. 4. Laqab: An honoriﬁc or descriptive title, or occasionally a nickname, often held by nobility, religious notables or other important ﬁgures. Many laqabs consist of a compound term ending in “al-Din” (of the faith) or “al-Dawla” (of the state), while another common form is to start with “al-Malik” (the king), followed by''
''a descriptive term. Individuals may have more than one laqab. 5. Nisba: A broad term denoting profession, place of origin or birth, or tribe or family. It can also be a descriptive element. Nisbas often begin with the deﬁnite article “al-” and end in “i,” in the case of men, or “iyya,” in the case of women. An individual may have several nisbas.''
''As an example, the full name of Saladin is: Al-Malik al-Nasir Salah al-Din Abu’lMuzaffar Yusuf ibn Ayyub ibn Shadhi al-Kurdi''
''This breaks down into: a) Al-Malik al-Nasir (the King who Aids laqab) b) Salah al-Din (Righteousness of the Faith laqab) c) Abu’l-Muzaffar (father of al-Muzaffar kunya) d) Yusuf (Joseph ism) e) ibn Ayyub (son of Job nasab) f) ibn Shadhi (son of Shadhi nasab) g) al-Kurdi (the Kurd nisba) A number of sample isms, laqabs and nisbas are given below. Other Muslim names may be found in many history books about the Middle East.''

''SAMPLE MUSLIM LAQABS''
''Given their predominance in government, Muslim laqabs are most commonly used by men.''
''• Men’s laqabs: ‘Imad al-Din (Support of the Faith), ‘Izz al-Din (Power of the Faith), Nur al-Din (Light of the Faith), Salah alDin (Righteousness of the Faith), Sharaf al-Din (Honor of the Faith), Baha’ al-Dawla (Beauty of the State), Majd al-Dawla (Glory of the State), Nasir al-Dawla (Aid of the State), Sayf al-Dawla (Sword of the State), Shams al-Dawla (Sun of the State), Nizam al-Mulk (Order of the Kingdom), Fakhr al-Mulk (Pride of the Kingdom), Taj al-Muluk (Crown of Kings), alMalik al-’Adil (the Just King), alMalik al-Afdal (the Most Excellent King), al-Malik al-Kamil (the Perfect King), al-Malik al-Nasir (the King who Aids), al-Malik al-Salih (the Righteous King). • Women’s laqabs: Walidat Khalil (Mother of Khalil — used by the Mamluk sultana Shajar al-Durr (r. 1250), indicating her being mother to the son of al-Salih II Ayyub), Radiyyat al-Din (Approval of the Faith).''

''• Men’s nisbas: al-Kuﬁ (of Kufa), al-Makki (of Mecca), al-Isfahani (of Isfahan), al-Farisi (of Persia), al-Khwarizmi (of Khwarizm), alKalbi (of the tribe of Kalb), alKhazraji (of the tribe of Khazraj), al-Qaysi (of the tribe of Qays), al-Shaybani (of the tribe of Shayban), al-Ayyubi (of the family of Ayyub), al-Kutubi (the bookseller), al-Qalanisi (the hat-maker), al-Suyuﬁ (the swordmaker), al-Shaﬁ’i (follower of the Shaﬁ’i school of law), al-Mutanabbi (claiming to be a prophet). • Women’s nisbas appear in the''
''masculine or feminine forms in historical sources, depending on whether the author regards them as being part of the woman’s name or the patrilineal genealogy. Generally if the kunya is placed after the nasabs, the nisbas will be in the feminine. The feminine forms of the above are: al-Kufiyya, al-Makkiyya, al-Isfahaniyya, al-Farisiyya, al-Khwarizmiyya, al-Kalbiyya, al-Khazrajiyya, al-Qaysiyya, al-Shaybaniyya, al-Ayyubiyya, al-Kutubiyya, alQalanisiyya, al-Suyufiyya, alShafi’iyya, al-Mutanabbiyya.''

==Berber Names==

''Muslim name structures are generally used by most Berbers except the Tuareg, with only a few differences. Traditional Berber isms tend replace the Arabic components but Laqabs and nisbas tend to follow the Muslim model, although often using their Tamazight equivalents. Traditional Berber men have much simpler names compared to their more Arabized counterparts, although some of the more urban individuals have adopted the extended Muslim naming conventions and use openly Arabic names. The most common structure for a traditional Berber man is “(name) ag (name),” where “ag” stands for the similar Arabic term “ibn” or “son of.” Traditional Berber women have even simpler names than their menfolk and lack a patronymic. Famous Berber women are often referred to merely by a single forename in daily use or just use a Tamazight laqab. The majority of Tuareg have Tamazight names like other Berbers, although some members of the more northern tribes use Arabic elements. As an example, Aljilani ag Ibrahim is “Ajilani, son of Ibrahim” and the use of both Tamazight and Arabic elements in his name likely signifies mixed heritage. Several apparently Christian names have been encountered, hinting at possible pre-Islamic influence.''

==Maghrebi Arabs==

''Troupes who select a Mythic African setting for their sagas may opt for a mixture of character origins. This section helps players to maintain their role when playing African Arabs, who are the most numerous people in the northern part of the continent.''

==Pick A Religion==

''The vast majority of characters who live in the Maghreb are Muslims. Muslim characters must publicly demonstrate certain virtues, or they gain negative Reputations. That being said, the True Faith Virtue is no more common in Mythic Africa than in Mythic Europe. Most Muslims fall short of the saintly ideal. As a rough guide, the further west an Arabic character comes from, the more religiously conservative he is likely to be, provided he is not from Marrakesh. Characters who are poor or nomadic are less likely to make excuses for luxuries than their urban co-religionists.''

[|

==This Is Not Real Islam==

''Real-world Islam is too complex to be described in a role-playing sourcebook. This book instead contains simple guidelines to allow non-Muslims to play characters who are superﬁcially suitable for telling stories similar to traditional folktales. No offense is intended by this. Players are encouraged to learn more about Islam, to enrich their game experience.''

|]
''THE VIRTUES OF A GOOD MUSLIM''
''Islam has ﬁve key activities, referred to as Pillars, which demonstrate the submission of the worshiper to the will of Allah. Profession of Faith and Attempt to Follow The Faith’s Laws: To become a Muslim, a person must make the statement that there is no God but God, and that Mohammed is His Prophet, in the presence of Muslims. This serves a vaguely similar role in Islam to baptism in Christianity, in that it brings the person into the community of the religion. The religious instructions given to Mohammed are recorded in the Qur’an. In addition to this, Muslim jurists consult a series of folk-sayings which have passed down from the Prophet. Regular Prayer: A Muslim prays at ﬁve speciﬁed times each day, while facing Mecca. These times are between dawn and sunrise (preferably well before sunrise), slightly after noon, in the afternoon, after sunset but before dusk, and after dusk (preferably before midnight). Before prayer, the worshiper washes certain parts of the body. A Muslim need not to go to a mosque to pray, but many ﬁnd it convenient to do so. A mosque provides water for cleansing, and has a niche to mark the correct direction to pray toward. Friday is the holiest day, and many Muslims make a particular effort to get to the mosque at midday. Giving alms: Characters are expected to give alms. Some rulers also collect taxes for redistribution as alms. The idea that wealth is a reward for virtue, or conversely that the poor somehow deserve to be poor, is foreign to Maghrebi thought. Fasting: Particularly during the month of Ramadan, a character is required to fast, unless a child, elderly, pregnant, ill or traveling. Fasting includes not drinking water, so it can be difﬁcult to adjust to the fast when it occurs in hotter times of the year. During the evenings of Ramadan, people often break their fasts with lavish feasts, taking turns to host their friends and neighbors. There are certain other dietary taboos in Islam, like pork, alcohol, and garlic, which are observed''
''with varying degrees of stringency. Pilgrimage: Each Muslim, particularly every man, should try to visit Mecca, and preferably also Medina, at least once in his lifetime. A character who returns from pilgrimage is honored with the title of Hajj (masculine) or Hajja (feminine) and many wear green head coverings to mark their status. Poorer people often go on pilgrimages to other places: three pilgrimages to Kairouan are considered the same as a pilgrimage to Mecca, by poorer Maghrebis.''
''NON-MUSLIM CHARACTERS: THE DHIMMI FLAW''
''Christians perform useful functions in Muslims society, and are allowed to remain in Mythic Africa provided they fulﬁll certain duties, and avoid provocative acts. These social restrictions are reﬂected mechanically in the Dhimmi Flaw, which is a Minor General Flaw. Characters who do not reside in Mythic Africa might use Outsider instead. As a general rule, the further west characters are in the Maghreb, the worse dhimmis are treated. Jews are treated particularly badly. If your saga’s history follows that of the real world, the last synagogue in Marrakesh will close in four years’ time. There are exceptions, which are described in the city chapters later, but the Golden Age of Jewish acceptance that ﬂowered in the previous century is over in the Maghreb. Dhimmis must not:''
''• avoid paying the annual tax on dhimmis • hold ofﬁces of government, which includes rank in the army • proselytize • have sex with or marry Muslim women. • carry weapons • plot with the enemies of the ruler • give evidence against Muslims (even in self-defense) • wear religious symbols • be disruptive, by praying or ringing bells, or having lavish funerals • create new places of worship, or repair current ones without permission. • publicly do things Muslims ﬁnd''
''unsightly, like eating pork or drinking alcohol • hide the distinctive mark on their clothes, in areas where such a mark is used • ride horses or camels • react badly to expressions of contempt, by Muslims, for their low status''
''The two main roles for Christians in Mythic Africa are as guards and merchants.''
''GUARDS''
''Many Muslim leaders think it wise to have bodyguards who have no connection to the webs of social obligation which permeate Mythic African society. They therefore hire foreign guards. The rule that dhimmis may not bear arms is not enforced in this case. A problem with hiring mercenaries is maintaining their loyalty; a bodyguard who ﬁghts only for money is not dependable in a coup d’etat. To minimize the risk of betrayal, the nobleman must be selective in his choices. The younger sons of European noble houses are often chosen as bodyguards. They have the rudiments of a code of honor, and extensive training in armored ﬁghting. Most are grateful that they have not been forced to become sellswords, but can retain the dignity and lifestyle associated with their birth. Many cannot go home, due to intrafamily feuding, or because their lands have been claimed by others. None of these things make these recruits perfectly loyal, but they make the Europeans socially disconnected. This allows the nobleman to build loyalty by binding the Europeans to himself and his allies. Intermarriage, without conversion, is of course impossible, but conversions, or concubinage, often occur.''
''MERCHANTS''
''Christian merchants form enclaves in many of the coastal cities of the Maghreb. They are not permitted to trade through the Straits of Gibraltar, but trade to other parts of Europe is common. Sicily, in particular, is a major''
''market for African goods. Players with merchant characters may ﬁnd the City and Guild supplement useful.''
''MONEYLENDERS AND WINE-SMUGGLERS''
''Many professions in this society are forbidden non-Muslims, forcing Dhimmis to ﬁnd work in less savory industries. This means that many of the jobs which are left for Jews to do in Mythic Europe are, in Mythic Africa, performed by Christians. Money-lending, for example, is one of these jobs. Christian money-lenders in Mythic Africa suffer much the same opprobrium that Jewish moneylenders do in Europe. Another signiﬁcant shadow industry is the supply and sale of alcohol. Muslims are forbidden to make, transport, or sell alcohol, but many drink it regularly. All Christians, in comparison, are meant to know a priest, and all priests require wine to perform the Mass. This means every Christian, in theory, knows a man who knows a man who makes wine. Many Muslims have a Christian contact who is their supplier. The main alcohol in the Maghreb is date wine, but this trade is also dominated by Christians.''

==Always Speak Respectfully==

''When communicating, characters from this region are careful to maintain the dignity of the person with whom they are speaking. They use a variety of techniques for this. Speaking in this way is one of the charms of the setting and troupes are encouraged to experiment with it. Characters speak to each other in a formal, polite way, even within close friendships and families. Lacking any other social cue, the honoriﬁc sidi for a man, or lella for a woman, can be used to mark the person the character is speaking to as an honorable person of higher status, greater age, or deeper wisdom. This politeness does not extend to public spaces: people on the street are fair game for all kinds of jostling.''
''AVOID MAKING DIRECT REQUESTS''
''A character unable to meet a reasonable request may lose face, so it is important to phrase requests as suggestions, or to send them through intermediaries. Conversely a character who is given a reasonable request must fulﬁll it, and what is considered reasonable is judged by different, and perhaps broader, criteria than are found in European cultures. This, importantly, includes requests for information, or pressing for answers to questions. If a person asks for information, and you cannot provide it, you lose face, and then he loses face for embarrassing you.''
''AVOID SPEAKING ABOUT THE FUTURE''
''Respect for God is demonstrated by the use of the phrase “if God wills it” when speaking about intended actions. By using this phrase, the character is signaling his acceptance of God as author of human destiny. In any case, speaking about good fortune about to be realized is foolish, as it invites the Evil Eye from jealous rivals. This is represented as a +3 bonus on Hex rolls, to destroy the circumstance discussed, by any character who envies the speaker.''

==How to Act==

''This section highlights some key features of Maghrebi culture. Players are encouraged to consider them when determining the actions of their characters.''
''AVOID SHAME''
''A person does not accrue shame for sinning: shame is the public knowledge of his transgressions. This means that certain sins, like drinking, accrue little shame in most communities, and sins with no living witnesses, like murder, accrue no shame. Characters from Mythic Europe often do not care that they have negative Reputations, or deliberately cultivate them. Some nobles, for example, think it wise to have a bloodthirsty''
''Reputation, as it keeps their neighbors pliant. In contrast, a Muslim character from this area generally wishes to expiate any negative Reputation, lest his family repudiate him, to free themselves of shameful associations. This society, aware of the need to redress shame, has many methods of countering it.''
''REPUTATIONS AND SHAME''
''If a character has a negative Local Reputation, the usual method of removing it is to deliberately do contrary things, so that a rival Reputation is formed. Once the competing Reputation equals the undesired Reputation, new experience gained in the second Reputation can instead be used to buy down the ﬁrst (rules for this are found on page 167 of ArM5.) This culture has such a strong emphasis on shame that other characters expect and accept that characters with a shameful Reputation will counter it in this way. It’s not seen as cynical: attempting to reconcile with society is both morally right and obvious. The epitome of removing shame is to go on the Haj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. The Haj is, from a game perspective, a series of scenes. Each of these grants Reputation experience to erode negative Reputations and grant a positive Reputation as a Haji +1. It also provides other beneﬁts, depending on the events which take place during the character’s travels. Shorter pilgrimages can also remove negative Reputations but because they contain fewer events, they may not provide as much experience. This is why, in game terms, some pilgrimages are described on the basis that “ﬁve (or three, or whatever) pilgrimages to here are equal to a pilgrimage to Mecca.” Beyond it’s social role, in mediating shame, the Haj also grants religious insight. The Haj may be simulated using the rules for pilgrimages given in The Church (pages 15–19). A character can undergo both enlightenment and social rehabilitation simultaneously, but these are different processes. Shame removal through pilgrimage is a social, not a supernatural, tradition.''
''THE GIFT''
''Although being Gifted is not, of itself, shameful, it makes people distrust magi. This makes it easy for magi to develop negative Reputations, which are shameful.''
''ASSOCIATE WITH FORTUNATE PEOPLE''
''One large difference between Muslims from this area and those further east is a belief in baraka, which is a sort of supernatural power. Baraka will be called fortune in this book, to differentiate it from a similar concept discussed in Realms of Power: The Divine. People with fortune are more skillful, luckier and happier than other people. Fortune is given before birth as an element of the person’s fate; it is not earned during life. Nonetheless, if you interact with people who have powerful fortune, you''
''can be pulled into fortunate situations by them, so its almost like having good fortune yourself. There’s no particular Virtue representing fortune, and Hermetic magic cannot detect it, although it can sometimes detect the effects of the Virtues it creates. Player characters who are wealthy, lucky or highly skilled have fortune. Player characters who are poor, unlucky, or of modest skill do not. People are seen to have fortune by others; they do not trigger their fortune as a person might use the daily power associated with Mythic Blood, for example.''
''MURABITIN''
''People with fortune are often so thankful for their blessings that they become deeply religious. This leads them to True Faith and murabitinism, a sort of''
''sainthood. Once a murabit dies, some of his fortune resides in his relics and place of entombment, which is also called a murabit. Many families have a favorite local saint, who they pray to as an intercessor, and whose tomb they visit once a year. A man who fails to perform this duty would not be surprised if spirits of place or faeries came to torment him, for failing to show respect to his family’s benefactor.''

[|

==Agencies==

''If your troupe is using the rules for agencies published in Houses of Hermes: Societates (pages 140–144), what the character is doing is constantly pushing up bond scores, so that when the character needs help, it can be requested without weakening the Bond markedly.''

==Leisure of the Wealthy==

''Wealthy people have many diversions to ﬁll their time.''
''AT HOME''
''As described elsewhere in this chapter, Maghrebi people try to include others in many of their daily tasks. They also hold parties in their homes strictly for the pleasure of entertaining their friends. Among men of property and inﬂuence, these parties vary in tone due to cultural differences between hosts, and due to the strictness with which that particular social circle conforms to the Islamic ideal. Sharing food plays an important role in recreation. Lunch is the largest meal of the day. The people of this region eat a diet similar to those in the northern Mediterranean, with a few differences. Spices are cheaper here, particularly in the large cities, and so they are more common in food. More dates are eaten in Mythic Africa than elsewhere. Flatbread is served with virtually every meal, and is often ﬂavored with aniseed. Couscous, small grains of pasta made from the hard bits of wheat that resist stone-grinding, is''
''a staple in the diet. All the food is served together, in large communal dishes. People always eat with the right hand. In some parts of the Tell, the current fashion for these parties requires characters skilled in Carousing. Each attendee dresses in a bright robe. He perfumes his beard with musk or rosewater. At the party he sits on a couch that wraps around three sides of the room (called a diwan), or on a stool with a mattress upon it. He is served from huge communal dishes of food, with are placed on little tables or on the ﬂoor. Wine and date wine are liberally provided. Entertainment comes from slave-songstresses, who often belong to the host. The affections of these women are open to negotiation. Characters who wish to discuss signiﬁcant business matters may need to attend, or throw, such parties, but a Reputation as a great host may alienate local holy men, particularly if the characters are unbelievers.''
''TOWN AND COUNTRY''
''Local people usually socialize at home, but there are two major excep''
''tions. Characters attend the public baths. They also participate in sport, which must usually be undertaken outside the city. Bathing follows the Roman model, but public baths are less opulent than in Roman times. Characters can sweat, swim, and get massages together, while discussing political affairs, mutual acquaintances, or business matters. Barbers and physicians also sometimes attend the bathers. Sports popular in the Tell tend to be descended from military training. Archery, fencing, horse racing and throwing javelins are simply practice for war, now done with friends and refreshments. Polo is used to practice small unit cavalry tactics, while a ball and mallet game similar to croquet or hockey serves a similar purpose for infantry. Hunting and falconry are also popular. Falconers in the Tell take prey from birds quickly, then slit the animal’s throat. This means the animal dies of an injury caused by a human. This is important, because Islamic law forbids eating the ﬂesh of animals who have been killed by predators.''

|]
''Although thought of as holy men — and, rarely, women — local saints and their tombs can be tied to any Realm. Some think that people who have lots of fortune, but aren’t particularly holy, can still become local saints. This is true, but in this case the “saint” is not aligned with the Divine Realm. It’s either a Magical spirit of place, or a faerie playing the role of saint. Intermediaries between man and God are speciﬁcally forbidden by the Qur’an, which is why conservative Muslims and those from outside the region worry that these saints are demons (particularly False Gods). Some murabits have local sects of followers, who practice secret teachings. A character able to observe the initiatory rituals or activities of a sect can sometimes determine which Realm a particular murabit is aligned to. Examination of the tomb, and detection of its aura, is also helpful in some cases, although Infernal murabits mask their true allegiance.''
''ACT AS A MEMBER OF YOUR SOCIAL CLASS''
''Wealthy or educated characters must reinforce their place in society by commanding those with less status. This means characters socialize within their own class. If your character has an education, or wealth, he must not do physi''
''cal labor. The country is full of slaves, or people who can be employed for virtually nothing. To fail to employ people is to fail one’s community.''
''DRESS APPROPRIATELY FOR YOUR WEALTH''
''Male dress in Mythic Africa usually consists of a few basic articles. The fundamental garments are loose trousers, which on their own theoretically meet the standards of modesty. These are almost always worn with a long, often hooded, robe and a head covering. The head covering may be a scarf, turban or hat. The headdress may identify the ethnic or geographical origin of the wearer. The basic garments are usually accompanied by tough slippers and a jacket. Women in the presence of men not closely related to them are required to cover their bodies and arms in garments loose enough to be unprovocative, but not so loose as to make them indistinguishable from each other. They must also cover their hair. Generally the body is covered with a single piece of colored cloth held together with pins, and the hair is covered with a scarf. Berber women wear brighter and more revealing clothing than Arabs. Clothes are a useful way to express''
''social distinction. The clothing of rich people is brighter and has ﬁner embroidery than that of the poor. Similarly, rich people conspicuously display jewelry. In opposition to this characters on pilgrimage all wear white unadorned clothing as a sign of the equality of people before God.''
''MAINTAIN YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK''
''Characters from this area spend a lot of time with family, friends, and business contacts. This seems, to some Europeans, as if there’s a continual round of parties, which is a bit decadent. The point of this, however, is to maintain social networks, purchased at character creation with Virtues like Social Contacts, Gossip and Temporal Inﬂuence. A person needs to spend a lot of time demonstrating his usefulness to his social network. Many of the tasks which could be performed at home are instead performed in public to provide further opportunities for maintaining a character’s social network. Communal bathing and food preparation, for example, allow characters to avoid wasting social time on necessary functions. Whenever your character is doing anything alone, seriously consid''

==The Jealous Wife==

''This faerie possesses women who fall from the central favor of their husband, when another wife has good fortune. Note that this means a house in which all wives are treated equally cannot be inhabited by the Jealous Wife. The Jealous Wife sometimes uses poison, and sometimes seems incapable of it. This may indicate there are several of these creatures. The Jealous Wife can, if she chooses not to kill, instead keep causing wives to rise and fall in the husband’s estimation, possessing each victim in turn. The Wife is not suited to be a player character.''
''Faerie Might: 15 (Mentem) Characteristics: Int +1, Per +1, Pre 0, Com +1, Str 0*, Sta 0*, Dex 0*, Qik''
''0*. * These statistics are provided by the human host. Size: 0 (as host) Virtues and Flaws: Focus Faerie Powers (Possession, see below), 2 x Increased Might, Loosely Material*; Incognizant. *Modiﬁed to a Minor Virtue: may only take forms using possession power Personality Traits: appears Jealous +3, Vengeful +3, but as some scholars have pointed out, the faerie cannot itself truly be jealous because it, personally, has not lost anything to the victim. The faerie just chooses women who have some social prompting toward jealousy, and''
''possesses them, acting as it thinks it would be interesting for them to act. This is mechanically best represented by personality traits. Combat: Fingernails *: Init +1, Attack +3, Defense +1, Damage +0 * Modiﬁed by the body’s statistics. The ﬁngernails are no more dangerous than those of a usual human.

Pretenses: Intrigue 5 (servants), but may use Pretenses equal to the Abilities of the host.''

''er whether it might not be better to throw a party, or invite some friends around to gossip while you all perform the same task. Gift giving also plays an important role in maintaining each character’s social network. When gifts are given, they are not opened in the presence of the giver, and might never be spoken of again. This is because to show enthusiasm for a gift implies the receiver needed a thing, but could not buy it for himself. This brings shame. Even religious rituals are performed at home. Circumcision is celebrated with a party. Couples are married at home. Funeral rites are performed at home. All of these life-rituals are shared with relatives and friends in the person’s private space, not in mosques. Most magi live in a way that’s considered particularly alien by Maghrebi people. A person who disappears into a laboratory for hours, without seeing other people, is weirdly antisocial. Those magi who lock themselves away for three months are clearly holy, hiding shameful acts, or insane. That most magi do not live with members of their''

==The Jealous Wife (Cont’d)==

''Powers: Possession, 1 or more points, Init +2, Mentem: If this power penetrates, the victim is possessed by the Jealous Wife and is under her direct control. Any attempt to force the victim to act contrary to her nature, or to use any of the host’s own magical powers requires that faerie spends Might. A supernatural power (including spell-casting) requires 1 Might point per magnitude to produce. A questionable action that is contrary to the nature of the host requires the faerie to exceed the possessed being’s Personality Trait roll on a stress die + Might points spent. The storyguide may give a modiﬁer to the Personality Trait roll based on the nature of the command (see the Entrancement power, ArM5, page 65, for suggestions). Both Might costs must be met if the use of a supernatu''
''ral power is also contrary to the victim’s nature. If the Jealous Wife is in direct control of its host’s actions, the host acquires her Magic Resistance, but is also affected by wards that would normally exclude her. If the host is acting under her own free will, then she does not beneﬁt from Magic Resistance, but may also walk through wards with impunity. This power’s costs are not based on the Hermetic system of magic: it is based on material in Realms of Power: Magic. Equipment: Someone else’s body, all of their material goods. Vis: 3 Mentem, in the ﬁngernails of the possession victim. Appearance: This faerie does not have a material body, but if seen with Faerie Sight, or Second Sight outside a body, she seems to be a face with a furious expression that ﬂoats like a mask before the victim’s head.''
''STORY HOOK: THE CHAMELEON''
''A messenger contacts the player characters with an offer from a powerful lady in a nearby town. Her husband has been visiting prostitutes, and she wishes to regain his favor. In Tunisian folk magic a perfect way to reorient the desire of straying husbands is to put the bones of a chameleon into his food. She would like to buy a dead chameleon, and offers a valuable jewel in exchange for it. How will the player characters hunt a chameleon? It can be so similar to what stands behind it as to be virtually invisible and has a venomous bite. After the characters have given the dead chameleon to the lady’s servant, can they ﬁnd another use for its venom? What strange effects on the body does chameleon venom cause?''

''family is considered tragic. People may assume that some terrible thing has occurred in the magus’s homeland. That magi do not, generally, marry is considered both scandalous and extremely sad.''

==Segregate by Sex==

''Life is divided into public and private spheres in the Maghreb, and women are part of the private sphere, while men dominate both.''
''FEMALE AGENTS''
''It is almost impossible for male characters to speak to women of high social status to whom they are not related. This strict sexual segregation makes female characters useful when gathering information or exploring the homes of non-player characters. Women often socialize at the baths or while performing chores, either in their homes or on their rooftops, and trading interesting information with each other is one way to maintain their social network. Female characters are often restricted from the full range of public actions they could perform in European settings. This can sometimes split the story a troupe is telling into two plot lines which run in parallel. To keep the group together, female characters may wish to pretend to be boys. This is may be represented with the Dark Secret Flaw, if the risk of discovery is a story element the troupe wishes to explore. If a player simply wants to keep the group together, but doesn’t want the ruse to generate potential stories, then the character may still pretend to be a boy, but this isn’t a Flaw.''
''HUSBANDS AND POLYGAMY''
''A woman has a fuller life once married, because she is able to travel while accompanied. Even female magi may ﬁnd it easier to have a man who might conceivably be a husband do much of the talking. Under Islamic law a man may have four wives at any one time, provided he treats them equally. Only''
''rich men can afford several wives in a culture where no wife may work outside the house (or at all, for wealthy women). On the other hand, many nobles have more than four partners. There are three main ways to have more than four partners. The ﬁrst is to just ignore the rule, which is a popular choice with kings. Concubines do not count toward the total: a man may have as many of those as he likes. Finally, a man may only have three wives at a time, but divorce only takes a minute. Some nobles keep a lot of women in their harem, marrying them as their sexual proclivities require and divorcing afterward. They never have more than four legal wives simultaneously, and never have sex out of wedlock. The vast majority of Islamic scholars think this is an abuse of the intentions, if not strictly the words, of the Qur’an. Jealous wives are as common in Arabic stories as evil stepmothers in European stories. Some magi have suggested that women who suddenly become vicious and violent when another wife becomes pregnant, ﬁnds treasure, or otherwise changes her status, are possessed by faeries or have been tempted by demons.''

==The Berbers==

''The Berbers are the original inhabitants of Mythic Africa. They have witnessed the invasion of many other races — Phoenicians, Romans, Visigoths, Greeks, and several waves of Arabs — but are still the dominant African culture. Closely allied to the Berbers are the Tuareg, a nomadic people of the Great Desert (see later).''

==Appearance==

''The Imazighen are a Mediterranean people, similar to Greeks or southern Italians in appearance, although their skin is usually more deeply weathered by the hot desert winds. They have an olive complexion and dark hair tones, although auburn and blond are not unknown.''
''Men wear a hooded woolen robe or tajellabiyt, with a wool cloak called an asilham for nighttime or in the mountains. Women veil themselves in a white cotton dress called a haik, and a headscarf called a tahruyt. If she might be seen by a man who is not a member of her family, the tahruyt is pulled over the face so that only the right eye is exposed. Women also have a ceremonial haik and tahruyt which is dyed indigo. This tahryut is embroidered with traditional symbols like those used in tattoos.''
''TATTOOS''
''Tattooing has a long history in Berber culture, despite the Islamic Hadith where tattoos are proscribed. Berber usage falls under aada or ‘normative practice’ and is permitted by local clerics. Amazigh women are far more likely to be tattooed than the men; it is generally accepted that women with tattoos are more beautiful than those without. The symbols used are passed down from mother to daughter, although inﬂuenced by personal preference. Women bear symbols called siyala on the face, neck, and chest. Siyala are marked in green, a holy color. A line from the lip to the chin is marked when a woman is married; and over time this''

==Moors, Berbers, or Imazighen?==

''The term “Berber”derives from “barbari,” a term used by the ancient Greeks to describe the people of Africa. Despite its lack of general use, it is a handy English word to describe the people and the culture native to Mythic Africa. The Berbers refer to themselves as Imazighen (singular Amazigh), meaning “free men”; this is the origin of a Roman name for them, the Mazices. The Romans more generally called the Imazighen “Mauri,” from whence the Europeans get their term “Moor” which they apply indiscriminately to Berber and Arab alike. In this book we use the term “Berber” and “Amazigh” interchangeably, but reserve “Moor” for the Mauritanians.''

''line is extended and embellished with crosses and palm fronds that indicate the number of children she has, and records family events and tragedies. She might also have her eyes outlined with dots (called “ant-tracks”), or mark her nose, cheeks, or brow with other simple symbols. Body markings are called ahadjam, and are usually more extensive and occur on both sexes, but are still more common on women. Designs on the back prevent and treat infertility, those on the breast enhance sensuality, those on the wrists and ankles protect against the evil eye, whereas those on the hands and feet are supposed to prevent possession by the jnun. A necklace tattoo might ring the neck bearing many potent symbols. A later insert describes some of the forms and purposes of traditional ahadjam. For special occasions, these symbols may be elaborated with tawzayt, temporary symbols marked with henna (orangebrown), saffron (yellow), or harquus (a black dye); such symbols are often elaborate, and require a specialist cosmetician called a neggafa to apply them. Some ngagef are magicians who endow these ceremonial tattoos with power.''

==Berber Culture==

''Berber society is nominally leaderless; indeed, they are united by a common resistance to the imposition of a centralized authority. Egalitarianism is a strong motivator of many Berber cultural traits; Berber villages, for example, have equal-sized houses — a rich man is not accorded any more space. Privacy and self-sufﬁciency are also very important to Berbers. It is considered shameful to buy milk, for example; it implies that the family cannot manage to support itself. Furthermore, excess should be freely given rather than sold.''
''GENDER ROLES''
''In Imazighen communities, men and women occupy entirely different social spaces. The man is responsible for everything occurring outside. Berber men are most often herders of''
''sheep and goats, which they graze on the tribal pasture. Berber men also take on trades that need to be outside, such as metalworking and butchery. Even simple tasks like going to market are performed by men. The grainstore is the exclusive province of Amazigh men; it is a matter of great scandal for a woman to be seen near one. The female space is found within the home. A Berber house is ruled by the wife or mother of the eldest male in the family; she is entirely responsible for the household economy and the behavior of those who live with her. Trades that take place inside are the task of women; this is principally the preparation of wool and associated trades such as weaving and dyeing. However, making pottery, baskets, any food-related trade, and even carpentry are women’s trades. The Amazigh woman is more likely to be literate than her husband: women teach each other to read and write while they work together at the loom or at the potter’s wheel. The local fountain is the women’s taboo place; it is deeply improper for a man to approach one. Despite the strict separation between men and women, the Imazighen are more permissive toward women than Arabs, in general. Monogamy is the norm, even though Islam permits the taking of up to four if a man is capable of supporting them.''

==The Village==

''The village (in Tamazight, thaddart) is the heart of Berber life. Where possible, Berber villages are sited on the summit of hills dominating a valley below. The slopes are covered with closely packed houses, each one stepped back against the hill, giving a pyramidal appearance to the whole village, with the minaret of the mosque forming the apex. In the Atlas Mountains, it is common to build the village into the hill by excavating a whole cave system. Above-ground Berber settlements grow by extending further down the hill, so the older families are at the top and the newer arrivals toward the bottom. Villages can be tiny, with just 50 or so houses,''
''but those near to trade routes can be huge — 1500 houses or more. In Berber towns and cities, there is a physical separation between male space and female space. The streets are covered with vaults and are frequented almost exclusively by men, who line the dark streets with benches. Above, the vaults and roofs form a network of communications for the town’s women, unseen by the men except for ﬂeeting glimpses when they cross gaps between houses. Women learn to be light on their feet and good jumpers, although there are ladders and bridges for the less agile. Each house is two or three stories, with a terrace on the ﬂat roof. The house contains the family’s worldly goods; livestock are kept on the ground ﬂoor, other possessions in the family room above them. The uppermost story usually has a drying room for grain and fruit. Only the upper stories have windows, to maintain privacy. Three or four houses cluster around a courtyard that has a single entrance to the street; these are occupied by the families of brothers or cousins. Several of these clusters make up a ward, or thakherroubt, which are often based along occupational lines. Each ward has its own communal cemetery, threshing room, and grain store. Mixed wards occupied by outsiders — Arabs or Jews, mainly — are found near the edge of the settlement. Wards are arranged in concentric rings due to the way Berber villages grow. Each ward has its own council, or tajmait, composed of representatives from each family or lineage and presided over by an elected ofﬁcial called the amin. All adult men are represented in the meetings, and must attend them or else pay a ﬁne. Women are not permitted at the tajmait. The tajmait makes decisions on communal life, passes judgments, and issues ﬁnes for petty misdemeanors and unacceptable behavior. Money raised from the ﬁnes is spent on public works, the labor provided by the men of each ward as a form of taxation. Families with no representative have all decisions made for them by the tajmait as a whole until a suitable marriage can be arranged. The strongest penalty levied by the tajmait is excommunication: the offender is literally excluded from all communication; no-one will speak with him, trade with''
''him, or offer daughters for marriage. The most learned women of a ward form a group called the tala, named after the ward’s fountain where they meet. It is taboo for men to approach the fountain; this is a uniquely female space equivalent to the tajmait. This group’s principle function is to care for the bodies of the dead, but they also act as a kind of police force. They act on anonymous denunciations and take steps to control private behavior (unlike the tajmait, which controls public behavior). Accusations are investigated, and if necessary the tala decides on penances and punishments, which are enforced through pressure put on sons and husbands by their womenfolk. They provide counsel for those who''
''ask, and can, on occasion, alter the customs of the community entirely.''

==The Tribe==

''Berber villages occupy relatively equal pieces of territory with clearly demarcated boundaries between them. A group of villages — two to eight, sometimes more — within a given area forms a tribe or ‘arsh. Most trees and all vegetables grown on irrigated plots belong to the individual, whereas plow land put to grain crops if the rains come early belongs to the village. Pasture land is usually the property of the tribe as a whole. The tribe typically labors as''
''a group to terrace new land in preparation for vegetable crops, and to build the underground channels that bring the water. Members of a tribe trade with each other directly; Berbers do not hold markets, because this implies trade with outsiders, which is against Berber ideals of inviolability. The occasional peddler is tolerated, selling jewels, cosmetics, or other things which cannot be sourced locally. Berber men attend markets held outside the tribe’s lands; these tend to occur between tribes that specialize in different areas, for example between predominantly pastoral tribes and agricultural ones Tribes sometimes join to form a confederation, or thaqbilt. These confederations make up the three chief Berber “super tribes” of the Zenata, Masmuda, and Sanhaja.''

==Berber Beliefs and Folklore==

''Berbers are often considered superstitious by the Arabs of the coastal cities, an accusation that is not entirely unfounded. Islam was brought to Berbers by the Arabs, and it has always suffered amongst the Imazighen from that association. While most Berbers are nominally Muslim, their religious practices have pervasive influences from their pagan roots. This is most prominent in the Berbers of the interior, amongst whom is the greatest preponderance of pagan Berber tribes. Muslim Berbers are mostly followers of Ibadi Islam (see insert), and have little interest in persecuting others for their religious beliefs. Christianity has a minor following amongst Imazighen. It is most common amongst those who inhabit the coastal regions of the Tell, and adopted the faith from successive waves of Roman, Vandal, and Byzantine settlers. Few Berbers are overtly pagan, although many hold traditional beliefs that do not sit well with Islam. The mountain tribes are most likely to hold to the ancient ways and worship the same gods that they did before even the Carthaginians brought their''

==Kharijite and Ibadite Islam==

''Kharijism was the earliest religious sect of Islam. They were supporters of the fourth caliph Ali (656–661), until he submitted to arbitration over his right to the caliphate. Some of his followers withdrew to east of the Tigris and thus earned the name khariji, seceders. The Kharijites became increasingly fanatical, and spawned several sub-sects, both moderate and extreme. They saw themselves as the only true Muslims, and sought to establish a community where the Qur’an was the sole authority. Their core belief was that anyone who committed a major sin ceased to be a Muslim and must be expelled from the Faith, and killed as an unbeliever unless he repented. Faith was justiﬁed only with correct belief and right action. The Kharijis rejected the dynastic approach to the caliphate. Rather, any irreproachable believer could be caliph, and any caliph could be deposed if his actions did not conform to religious law. Another basic principle of Kharijite Islam was jihad, which they saw as the sixth pillar of Islam. It was the obligation of all true Muslims to use the sword in order to establish truth. Khariji saw it as their religious duty to rebel against any authority who fell below their high standard of behavior. Finally, Khariji were radically egalitarian, accepting all believers as equal regardless of class or''
''origin. Even non-Muslims are treated fairly, as long as they do not violate the word of the Qur’an. Khariji communities constantly rebelled against Umayyads and Abbasid rulers, whom they saw as false caliphs. They proved popular amongst new converts in both Persia and Africa who resented not being treated as equal by the Arab elite. Whilst Kharijism itself is now extinct in Africa, its core doctrines persist in the more moderate Ibadi sect. Ibadis do not believe in violent rebellion, and are more conciliatory toward other Muslims than their parent sect. Ibadis still consider sinners (including non-Ibadi Muslims) to be capable of repentance, although deserving of hostility. The religious elders and religious scholars (the Mashayekh) of Ibadi communities elect an Imam to promote good and prevent evil, and to be supreme military leader and judge. The imam’s rule is absolute while he conforms to religious law; if the Mashayekh become aware of failure to adhere strictly to the Qur’an they can remove him. Chief amongst the Mashayekh are the ‘Azzaba (those who have retired), who lead religious orders. Ibadism opposes Suﬁsm but accepts some mystic principles such as the baraka of great leaders. In the 13th century most Berbers are Ibadi Muslims, although the ruling Almohads are predominantly Sunni.''
''gods to this land. These three religions sit poorly side by side; most villages are either Muslim, Christian, or pagan, and the majority of that community follow the dominant belief. The chief exception is that the settuten are nearly always pagan, regardless of the prevailing faith of their community; if their wrong beliefs are overlooked by the imam or priest it is because of the service they can provide for the village. This willful ignorance has its limits.''
''THE GODS OF THE IMAZIGHEN''
''Pagan Berbers honor many gods, most of them personiﬁcations of nature. Their principle deities are Tafuyt, harsh goddess of the sun and Ayyur, god of the moon and sacriﬁces. Gurzil is the bull-headed god of war; his image has been carried into battle to incur his blessing on the enterprise. Anzar is the god of rain, a vital deity to the desert-dwelling people. The goddess of both fertility and death is Dunnit (“The World”), known as Tanit to the Carthaginians and Neith to the Egyptians; her name recalls that of the First Mother of the World (see later). The Berbers may also worship local deities of relevance to their villages, such as Baccax the god of caves and Lilleu, a river god. In the town of Badja, near Tunis, a stone engraving shows seven ancient Berber gods known as the Dii Mauri. Seated on a bench, they represent Bonchar in the center with a staff as the lord of the group. To his right, the goddess Vihina sits with an infant at her feet, representing home and childbirth. To the right of Vihina is Macurgum, who holds a scroll and a serpent entwined staff, the god of health. On Bonchar’s left stands enigmatic Varsissima, a goddess of secrets. Left of her, the goddess Matilam presides over the sacrifice of a boar. Standing at either end of the carving are Macurtan, holding a bucket as the god of the waters, and Iunam, god of the moon. Beneath the gathering is the Latin inscription, “salutares” (redemptory), “immortales” (immortal), and “augusti” (exalted). The Dii Mauri were mostly subsumed by the ar''
''rival of the Romans and their temples. Beyond the larger towns and the coast, Berbers treated these entities as jealous and capricious genius locii, offering them small sacriﬁces in cave shrines in exchange for noninterference or even minor aid in the form of plaguing one’s enemies. This practice persists in small communities to the present, but it is more a form of placation than worship, as village elders seek to protect their residents. Whether the Dii Mauri are listening, or smothered by the Divine, is another matter entirely. Pagan Imazighen also honor their dead ancestors as gods, and treat tombs as holy places. They swear oaths by placing their hands on a tomb, and may sleep within to receive dreams from the gods. In pagan communities, each head of the household is responsible for conducting the rites honoring the village’s gods, whereas the chief woman of the house is responsible for observing the family’s gods. The settuten are the closest thing to a formal priesthood since they are dedicated to the god of sacriﬁces. Like other pagan gods, most Berber gods are associated with the Faerie Realm.''
''YEMMA-T N DUNNIT AND AWETTUF''
''In the beginning there was just a man and a woman, and they lived beneath the earth in the sterile and dark Netherworld. The woman was called Yemma-t n Dunnit, the First Mother of the World, and she was a powerful witch. They had ﬁfty sons and ﬁfty daughters, who climbed through holes onto the light, fertile world above; these were the ﬁrst men. Initially, Yemma-t n Dunnit was a beneﬁcent (or at least, neutral) creatrix; she created the sun and moon, the stars, and all animals and plants. Having run out of things to create, she began to create destruction, and her evil grew. She instituted eclipses, dispute and discord, and even death. She is responsible for the hardships of the Berbers, while their enemies the Franks and Arabs prosper. The Yemma-t n Dunnit is the source of all evil counsel, malicious gossip, and hurtful lies. Many of her creations bear the marks of her evil: for example, the''
''porcupine has the wood splinters from her destroyed spindle on its back, and the tortoise was originally a calf who was crushed between her millstones. The moon god Ayyur is her son and Tafuyt the sun is her daughter. The evil of the Yemma-t n Dunnit is opposed by Awettuf the ant. Awettuf is the wise counselor of mankind, and the husband of Tafuyt. While he is not himself a creator, his advice enabled mankind to make the best of creation. Thus, the First Mother of the World created sheep, but Awettuf showed mankind how to use the meat for food and the wool for clothing. He demonstrated the growing of grain and making of bread, instituted rituals and sacriﬁce, and convinced the wild bulls to be domesticated by men.''

==Story Seed: The Christians of the Desert==

''Swathed in their litham veils, carrying their long takouba swords, thin lances and cross-decorated shields of gazelle hide, Tuareg warriors sometimes appear similar to Frankish knights, albeit mounted on dromedary camels. Some Arabic writers refer to the nomads as Nasara al-Sahra (Arabic: “Nazarenes of the Desert”) from a belief that that the Tuareg are lost Christians adapted to life in the deep desert. Characters may hear tales using this terminology and seek out the nomads, perhaps believing they are representatives of the mythic Christian king Prester John. Unfortunately, the Tuareg are entirely unChristian in their behavior and will just as soon heartlessly rob and beat any explorers seeking their aid unless presented with goods of value: camels, slaves or clothing. Will the characters be stranded in a forsaken realm of sand?''

''verse of the human world: mountains are deep pits, and ravines form cliffs across the landscape. Rivers of water cross the sky. The black sheep eat coal, and the black goats give black milk. When it is night in the mundane world, it is day in the Netherworld, for this is where Tafuyt retreats at night; similarly when the moon is not in the sky, the Berbers say that Ayyur is visiting his mother.''
''The Netherworld is peopled by spirits of the dead, hideous giants like the teryelen (ogresses), and dwarfs that swarm everywhere like ants, with whom they share kinship. Pagan Imazighen believe that mankind was born in the Netherworld, but climbed up through a hole in the sky into the mundane world above. When they die, they return to the Netherworld, but''
''they are not entirely cut off from the mundane world. A network of communications between the human world and the Netherworld exists, through tombs, wells, caves, and occasional iron gates built by jnun. Snakes in particular are the messengers between the Netherworld and ours, and should be treated with respect less they speak ill of you to your ancestors.''

==The Tagelmoust==

''The tagelmoust (Arabic: litham) is the dark blue veil worn constantly by Tuareg men. Composed of separate pieces of Sudanese cloth dyed indigo (see below), the veil is wrapped around the head to reveal only the eyes. The veil acts not only a practical protection against the sun and sand but is also central to the sense of identity of a male Targui — the Tuareg refer to themselves in Tamahak as Kel Tagelmoust, “The People of the Veil.” Many Arab detractors however believe that the Tuareg use the litham to mask their extreme ugliness! Each veil is unique in hue, although relatives and members of the same tribe usually have closely matched colors. The folding style of the veil denotes each Targui’s relative status within the tribe with nobles generally covering more of their face. Minor adjustments of the veil during conversation can reﬂect an individual’s mood or unstated opinion. A Targui warrior receives his ﬁrst veil in a ceremony overseen by a member of the ineslemen tribe on passing into adulthood at age eighteen and only removes it when replacing it with a new veil, reﬂected by the Vow (constantly wear litham veil) Minor Flaw. The basic litham veil of a mature Targui warrior is enchanted using hedge magic by a ineslemen magician aligned to the Magic Realm with a Level 25 Rego Auram effect that protects against sandstorms, which has Duration: Sun and 2 uses per day, effectively resulting in permanent protection against the conditions of the nomad’s homeland. An additional effect customarily woven into the veil is designed to provide protection against evil spirits — once per day, the wearer can invoke a Ward against Spirits of the Desert with Penetration ranging from between 5 and 20, depending on the status of the individual.''
''Tuareg men wear their veils constantly, not even removing them to eat or sleep after the age of 25. As the veils carry constant magical effects, this grants at least 2 Warping Points associated with the Magic (or Divine) Realm per year and older warriors have a Warping score of at least 1. By the eighth year of wearing a magical veil constantly, Tuareg males are plagued with frequent headaches and suffer from either the Short Attention Span or Poor Concentration Minor Flaw (see Realms of Power: Magic, page 50). By the age of forty, a Targui warrior who has worn his veil constantly has a Warping score of 3, which rises to 5 by the age of ﬁfty. Traveling through high strength Magic auras in the deep desert, passing through Magic regiones or exposure to other powerful magical effects can accelerate this process and cause the gain of additional characteristic Flaws at higher Warping scores. Gradually the deep indigo dye penetrates into their whole skin and, as their Warping score increases, they gain characteristic Flaws and Virtues following ArM5, pages 167– 168, as detailed below:''
''Warping Score Effect  2  Short Attention    Span or Poor    Concentration Flaw  3  Disﬁgured (deep   indigo skin)  5  Minor Supernatural   Virtue*  6  Wanderlust  7  Magical Air  8  Blatant Magical Air * Either Desert Regio Network, Dowsing (water), Lesser Immunity: Thirst, Second Sight or Wilderness Sense. Most Tuareg strongly believe their''
''veils actually help prevent their headaches rather than being the cause and suspect that their malady is a curse of the settut or malevolent jnun. To offset the Flaws gained from Warping, older Tuareg progressively seek to acquire more magically potent litham, amulets or other hedge magic items with enchantments offsetting the effects of Minor Flaws due to the Targui’s frequent headaches. Other minor magical effects mimicking the Minor Supernatural Virtues listed above are also sometimes be woven into the fabric at the time of creation. Unfortunately, the constant wearing of an assortment of minor magical items may actually increase the rate of accumulation of Warping points and lead to further negative effects.''
''VEILED WIZARDS AND HAJI''
''Male Tuareg wizards such as assehar (sahir), imhergi (cunning-folk), ineslemen (murabitin) and ineden (blacksmiths) do not suffer this style of Warping, but do Warp at an accelerated rate through wearing their veils constantly. Those cognizant magicians that realize the baneful effect of their magical headgear often substitute mundane indigo cloth and rely on their own magical protections. Others abandon wearing the litham altogether, substituting the equivalent of the Judged Unfairly Flaw for their Vow Flaw. Only haji, those infrequent Tuareg who have completed a pilgrimage to Mecca, are exempt from the requirement to wear a veil — their sacred status replaces the need to wear the litham and they exchange their Vow for the Pious Minor Personality Flaw instead.''
''The Netherworld is part of the Faerie Realm, although sections of it lie within Faerie regiones and can be more easily visited.''

==The People of the Veil==

''“The scorpion and the Tuareg are the only enemies you meet in the desert”  old Arab saying''
''The nomadic Tuareg (Arabic: “abandoned by god,” singular: Targui) are a collection of aggressive nomad tribes that roam the deep expanses of the Great Desert centered around the Ahaggar and Aïr massifs (Tuareg: Atakor and Ayăr respectively). They instead refer to themselves as the Kel Tagelmoust (Tuareg: “the People of the Veil”) or Kel Tamahak (Tuareg: “the People who speak Tamahak”).''

==Tuareg Culture==

''“Pillage is our work”  Tuareg saying''
''The verb iohagh means both “he is free” and “he pillages” — the concepts of brigandage and liberty are so inseparable to a Targui warrior that they have no concept of the plight of the victims of their raiding. Even a negotiated ghefara or “pardon” for protection means little to a traveling merchant as the raiders are just as likely to rob a caravan that passes out of their territory on the grounds that they are no longer under the speciﬁc band’s protection. Tuareg consider only camels, clothing, slaves, and weapons to have any signiﬁcant value. A Tuareg male noble’s worth is measured in the number of camels he owns and status displays amongst other men are reﬂected to a coquettish extreme by the amount of clothing worn. The more exotic and colourful the clothing a male Targui wears, the more status it conveys, regardless of the impracticality of multiple layers of heavy cloth in the bak''
''ing desert sun. The most famous item of Tuareg clothing is the tamelghoust or litham, an indigo dyed veil worn by all adult males except those rare Tuareg who have completed the hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. These nomads take little care about food or hygiene and are purported to eat almost exclusively the milk of sheep and camels, supplemented with roots or grains foraged from the sands or other foodstuffs begged from others. Nobles never ask but rather demand food in the form of mouna or “tribute” from their serfs or anyone unfortunate enough to be regarded as their inferior, and to a noble Targui, all but other noble Targui are inferior. Many Tuareg men are illiterate but all Tuareg speak Tamahak, the southernmost dialect of Tamazight common to these nomads but distinct from that of the settled northern tribes.''

''The basic unit of Tuareg society is the “drum group” or clan (tewsit), a collection of families summoned by an amghar or war leader’s large hemispherical war drum (ettebel). The larger societal unit of a Kel or confederation is a loose series of tribes (tawsheten) bound together under an amenoukal, nominally equivalent to a greater chieftain. Although respected, an amenoukal acts more as an impartial adjudicator for his confederation, albeit one who can be ignored without signiﬁcant consequence. There are several well known Kel located within the southern parts of the Great Desert:''
''• Kel Ajjer (found near the oasis of Ghat and the Tassili n Ajjer plateau) • Kel Ahaggar (overlord confederation of the Ahaggar massif) • Kel Ayr (dominate the Air massif) • Kel Owey (roam along the southeastern mountains and the Fezzan road) • Kel Ifoghas (settled around the Adrar Ifoghas massif)''
''In addition, the two Iwellemmeden confederations (the western Kel Ataram and eastern Kel Denneg) and the Kel Geres dwell further south in the deeper''

==Tuareg Story Seeds==

''The customs of the Tuareg can lead to many stories.''
''THE DEEP TUAREG''
''The enforced isolation of the elder Tuareg males due to the effects of Flaws gained from Warping often leads them deeper and deeper into the desert where they may fall prey to the attentions of the Great Sahara daimon known as the Hunger (alJu’ in Arabic). The more foolish are tempted to bargain with the spirit in return for release from their afﬂictions. At a minimum, these elder Tuareg become dark Spirit Votaries and suffer the Servant of the Desert Major Flaw. More commonly they are transformed into a unique form of undead Magic Humans with a Might Score known as Dessicated Men.''
''INDIGO DYE''
''This blue dye with the color of European woad was once known as indicum to the Romans. It is produced from several natural sources, all of which must be imported by the nomads from beyond the southern desert, from Europe or from as far aﬁeld as mythical Hind. Indigo dyed clothing denotes high status among the Tuareg and the dye is a vital component in the manufacture of the traditional litham veil of an adult Tuareg male. Any clothing dyed with indigo is considered a valued commodity. Magi are able to reproduce colors comparatively easily using Hermetic magic and may intervene in the dye trade from as far away as Europe or supply cloth to local Tuareg tribes when seeking allies while journeying through the desert regions.''

''desert and perhaps beyond, although whether these tribes are composed of mundane humans, Magic-kin, Magic Humans or Faeries playing out the nomad raider role is uncertain.''
''TUAREG CASTES''
''The rulers of Tuareg society are the imajeghen (singular: amajegh), the nobles who lead raids and expect to be served by all other humans, but are bound by an unusual code of honor equivalent to the Dutybound Flaw. A Tuareg noble has the equivalent of the Knight or Muslim Emir Virtue, but with a focus on hunting and travel as well as military activities. Equivalents for greater nobility amongst the Tuareg exist — an amghar is equivalent to a Landed Noble or Muslim ‘Muqta, and an amenoukal is equivalent to a Great Noble (see Lords of Men, page 31). The amenoukal of the Kel Ahaggar is equivalent in power to a European Duke, although much of his power is nominal at the peripheries of the Tuareg lands. Noted for their remarkable arrogance and sense of racial superiority, Tuareg nobles commonly possess the following Virtues and Flaws: Fury (not respected as superior), Obsession (appearance), Overconﬁdent, Oversensitive (to disrespect or lack of grooming), Piercing Gaze, Proud, Self Conﬁdent, Social Handicap (Superiority complex), Strong Willed, Wrathful. Beneath the ruling nobles are the imghad (singular: amghid), a vassal caste who comprise the bulk of the warriors and pasture the tribe’s goats and camels and act as the common soldiery on raids. Some tribes such as the Kel Ulli (Tuareg: “the goat people”) are composed almost entirely of these dependent pastoralists. The ineslemen are the religious caste of the Tuareg. Descended from the families of Tuareg marabouts, their neutral stance allows them to mediate between feuding tribes and individuals. Their leaders and other exceptional individuals may have magical powers or abilities reﬂecting the baraka associated with their holy ancestors. Tuareg ineslemen usually lack the Dream Interpretation powers of their northern counterparts and substitute Purity''

==Tuareg Raiders==

''Tuareg nobles typically lead a band of one to two-dozen lesser tribesmen from the imghad caste riding camels. Each is equipped with a lance and a takouba, the Tuareg longsword. Some bands are accompanied by disguised Tuareg settuten or even secretly led by one of the deep desert witches. The leaders of the more successful bands have an uncanny ability to ﬁnd their way through the trackless deserts and escape though hidden entrances to the regiones that cross the wastelands.''
''ALJILANI AG IBRAHIM, A TARGUI AMAJEGH''
''This noble has been designed for use as a starting Companion but requires 2 more Minor Virtues to balance and may choose up to one more Minor Virtue if balanced by an additional Minor Flaw. A more experienced raider leader may have additional martial skills, carry more protective amulets, or have additional Virtues & Flaws gained through Warping.''

''instead. They lack the power to Create Vis but may have access additional Holy Powers such as Adjuration and Wonders. Not all magicians from an ineslemen tribe are aligned to the Divine Realm — Infernal-aligned equivalents exist and some practitioners of other hedge traditions aligned to the Magic or Faerie realms may pass off their powers as baraka, masquerading as holy men to gain similar social beneﬁts. The eklan are the lowest caste, a class of black-skinned serfs who work the limited agricultural holdings of the Tuareg nobility. Similar to the Haratan of the northern Berbers, these workers are little more than true slaves, although the latter are referred to as abid and are universally drawn from blackskinned races. See the Berber culture section earlier for further details. The inenden are a pariah caste of wandering craftsmen. Believed to have Jewish origins, they practice a different form of magic from the settuten and have the Outcast Minor Flaw.''
''INESLEMEN''
''Minor Virtue, Social Status This character is a member of one of the designated religious tribes of the Tuareg and is therefore accorded some authority over disputes and immunity from the usual feudal demands of the nobles. He may purchase Theology: Islam, Islamic Law and (Realm) Lore during character generation and gains an additional 50 XP to spend on these Abilities. The character begins with the Minor Flaw Noncombatant, which does not yield any points for buying Virtues.''
''TUAREG WOMEN''
''Tuareg women are more respected than even their northern Berber counterparts and occupy a social position unequalled in other Islamic countries. Unlike the menfolk, these women disdain the veil and freely voice their opinions — many hold a prominent place in the leadership or counsel of each tribe and inheritance amongst the noble caste is matrilineal as “the stomach holds the child.” After marriage, a Targui woman is permitted a number of male friends who may visit her when her husband is out raiding, although such meeting rarely result in consummation. Tuareg women are so respected that when a band raids another tribe, the male warriors may be put to ﬂight or killed but the women and children are not molested and left with sufﬁcient equipment to survive — only the slaves and luxury items such as camels, gold, salt and ﬁne clothing are taken! Female Tuareg are generally better educated and mothers are responsible for passing down knowledge of their unusual script, Tiﬁnagh or Tidinar — the letters being similar to the ancient Libyan alphabet but particularly noted for being written in a random direction of writing rather than the right to left order of Arabic. They are also more musical in nature, than their men, singing traditional folk songs accompanied by either the anzad (a single stringed violin) or the tende, a small hand drum. Compared to the traditional medieval Arabic concept of beauty as proportional to the degree of obesity, Tuareg women are tall and elegant with their wrists frequently adorned with ﬁne bracelets or exceptional examples of embroidery and leatherwork. This contrasts to their clothing, which unlike the men is often poorly kept, dirty and comparatively revealing compared to the heavily swathed northern women who are inﬂuenced by the modesty dictated by the Arab dominated culture.''

==Tuareg Magic==

''Tuareg magic, like that of their northern Berber cousins, is split along gender lines, with a dominance of female practitioners across the different castes. Settuten are rarer than amongst other Berber tribes and women that practice forms of magic other that of the settuten are not uncommon. Male practitioners tend to be less powerful overall, unless created as marabouts or impostors from other hedge magic traditions that belong to one the ineslemen tribes. See Chapter 4: The Realms of Mythic Africa for further details.''
''TUAREG OF HERMES, TUAREG OF SULEIMAN?''
''Recent history provides examples of outcast Tuareg sahira who have escaped the wrath of the settuten and at least one sahir of the Order of Suleiman claims to be of mixed Tuareg heritage. In the 11th century, a Tuareg of the inenden caste is recorded as joining House Ex Miscellanea but his semi-Hermetic lineage appears to have disappeared or been absorbed into a small Muslim lineage within House Verditius. A Tuareg magus may provide an interesting archetype for either a player character or an antagonist in an African based saga.''

==The Banu Khalida==

''Out in front rides a Saracen, Abisme; King Marsile has no greater villain in his company, A man of evil traits and mighty treachery, He does not believe in God. ~ The Song of Roland, laisse 114''
''The great French epic The Song of Roland speaks of a very different variety of Moor than is found in most of Africa. This chanson de geste was written in the eleventh century, but tells of events in the eighth century, when the Moors had overrun the Visigothic kingdoms of Iberia and now set their eyes on the lands of the Franks. The poem recounts the attempt of twelve men to delay a hundred thousand Moors in the Pyrenean Roncevaux Pass until Charlemagne could arrive with his main force. The Moors described in the poem are sinister beings aligned with dark powers; many of''
''them have bestial characteristics or are said to have unnatural size, supernatural strength, or the power to enslave the minds of men. These are the Banu Khalida. This section presents a legendary people who fulﬁll the expectations of Mythic European prejudice about Moors. They could be villainous antagonists for the characters, lurking in distant lands and brewing their evil against the race of men. Travelers might come across the cities of the Banu Khalida by following trade routes across the desert. The Twelve Cities could even provide a source for a player character who is struggling to overcome his dark past.''
''BACKGROUND''
''Legend has it that the Moors of the Banu Khalida are descended from Khalid ibn Yazid, the adopted son of the Kahina. He was a traitor to the core: born an Arab, he rejected Islam to spare his life and professed Berber''

==The Unholy Trinity==

''Medieval European Christians have many misconceptions about Islam, perhaps the most common of which is that Muslims worship an unholy trinity composed of three deities known as Mahound, Termagant and Apollyon. This misunderstanding is in part due to early contact with the Banu Khalida in Iberia. In Ars Magica Fifth Edition the three deities are demons of the Order of False Gods (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 37), who seek to foment hostility between Christians and Muslims. They may be found operating anywhere within Mythic Africa, Europe or the Middle East, whispering their vicious lies into the ears of any who might listen. Like most False Gods, the demons usually take forms that will appeal to their listeners. In their original forms, though, they appear as follows: The demon Mahound takes the form of a grotesque parody of a monotheistic prophet, clothing itself in ﬁne robes of green silk and gold, and leering at those around it. It has immense ears, intended to mock the fact that such prophets heard the divine revelation. Termagant takes the form of a hag with an incredibly wrinkled face and bulging eyes, literally spitting venom at any who oppose it. It has sharp, jagged ﬁngernails with which it claws at its opponents’ eyes. Apollyon appears on ﬁrst glance to be a twisted parody of the Graeco-Roman Apollo, a hunchbacked, hideously ugly blond man with a lyre, dressed only in an oversized, ill-ﬁtting golden cloak. The cloak drips with acid and the lyre produces jangling discords that set teeth on edge and paralyze the senses.''

''paganism to ingratiate himself with the Kahina. He later tricked his foster brothers into becoming the captives of the Arab invaders. Khalid later appears, once again claiming to be a Muslim, leading a Berber army into Iberia with his apostate brothers. Khalid’s sons were amongst the survivors of the battle at Roncevaux Pass through base cowardice, and retained their territory in al-Andalus to become viceroys on the Iberian Peninsula. Their descendants, the Banu Khalida, were never amongst the more powerful taifa princes, but they navigated the delicate rivalries through secret alliances, clever marriages, and demonic assistance. The coming of the Almoravids was a major blow to the Banu Khalida power base. They had survived by keeping the factions ﬁghting each other, but a single Almoravid ruler enforcing a strict adherence to Islam was contrary to their way of controlling politics from behind the throne. The''
''Banu Khalida migrated en masse back to Mythic Africa, carving out a realm for themselves in southern Mauritania, beyond Almoravid inﬂuence. Here they still lurk, in the bled es-Siba, the “land of dissidence,” using their hellgotten powers to build a land of plenty on the edge of the torrid zone.''
''CULTURE''
''The Banu Khalida have a caste system that reﬂects their mixed ancestry. The Hassane are ruling warrior caste descended via Arab bloodlines from Khalid the Apostate. Below them are the Zawiya clerical caste, who gain protection from the Hassane in return for religious services and payment of a tributary tax. Subordinate to both Hassane and Zawiya are the Znaga, who are the laboring caste; this includes specialist professions such as the mraguen (ﬁshermen), mallemin (blacksmiths), and igawen (poets and praise-singers).''
''They must also pay tribute, and are forbidden from bearing arms. The Zawiya and Znaga have Berber origins, mostly from the Zenata tribe. The three upper castes are collectively called the bidan (“white”) castes, and are supported by the lower two castes who are black-skinned. The ‘Abid are the slave caste at the bottom of Banu Khalida society, and the Haratan are the freed slaves who form the bulk of the bureaucracy and army. Most bidan — even the commoner Znaga caste — have at least one house slave, and rich Hassani might own hundreds of ‘Abid and employ dozens of Haratan. The arrogance of the Banu Khalida is such that they believe they have total control over the lower castes, and for the most part this is true. Despite the designation of ‘bidan’ for the upper castes, skin color is no real determinant of caste. There are ebony-skinned members of the bidan just as there are pale ‘Abid and Haratan. The former come from high''

==Story Seeds: The Banu Khalida==

''A whole culture of diabolists is a rich source of stories.''
''A LOST TREASURE RETURNS''
''A valuable possession of the characters or their patron that went missing years ago reappears in the possession of a prominent local. The merchant from whom he bought it swears that he received it in legitimate trade. Investigations (or divinations) lead the characters through a chain of buying and selling back to the Twelve Cities. The possession was originally stolen using demonic powers to summon wealth. This is a good way to bring the Banu Khalida to the attention of the characters.''
''SLAVE REVOLT''
''For some years now, Islam has been spreading clandestinely through the ‘Abid of several cities. An Ibadi imam from the north has been teaching the Word of the Prophet, and the slaves have become aware that it is within their hands''
''to make the change. The characters meet an escaped slave who is trying to free his kinsman from Khalidi bondage.''
''INVASION''
''A hitherto unheard of coalition of three emirs threatens to destabilize the delicate power balance of the Twelve Cities. Under Termagant’s inﬂuence, they seek to raise an army to wage war against the Almohads to the north. Despite urging from their demoness patron, the emirs are exercising caution. They have dispatched spies into Almohad territory looking for defensive weaknesses; and if they ﬁnd none, to create some. The characters might foil the plans of one of these sorcery-enhanced spies, and become embroiled in the plots that threaten their homeland.''
''THE FOURTH ESTATE''
''The emir of Malprimis has been corrupted by a fourth False God, Baal-Peor (Realms of Power: the Infernal, pages 50–51). The Lord of Filth lacks any subtlety, yet still poses a threat to the Unholy Trinity’s monopoly on the souls of the Banu Khalida. Through Zawiya intermediates they manipulate outsiders (that is, the characters) into uncovering and destroying Malprimis’s dark worship.''
''TWICE-WON GOLD''
''A common tactic to keep the Hassane occupied is to trade gold with foreign merchants, and hiring out Haratan guards under the command of a Hassane scion. As the merchants return north, they are certain to be attacked by “bandits” — actually another band of Khalida. Whichever Hassane wins takes the gold back to the Twelve Cities. The presence of the characters amongst the merchant train might well ruin this scheme.''

''caste breeding with their slaves; such children inherit the higher caste if recognized by their parent, and suffer no stigma from skin color. White lower caste members derive from slaves taken or bought from the north, often European in origin. The Banu Khalida have their own language; they used Punic as a secret language during the taifa period, and now use it as their main language, although now cross-fertilized with Arabic and Tamazight. The Zawiya are taught Arabic, and many Hassane receive a formal education in that language as well. Znaga involved in trade may well speak some Tamazight. The Banu Khalida live in twelve cities named after the twelve peers of King Marsile who opposed the twelve peers of Charlemagne: Aelroth, Balaguer, Chernubles, Corsalis, Escremiz, Estorgans, Estramariz, Falsaron, Malprimis, Margariz, Moraine, and Turgis. They are placed just one''
''day’s journey from each other, with paved roads between to facilitate travel. Each of the cities is set in an oasis in the midst of a stony desert. The buildings are made from red clay baked hard in the sun, and are arranged around a central plaza. The oasis provides water for the nearby ﬁelds, which grow millet, dates, and forage for livestock. The population of these cities consists of three to six extended families each of Hassane and Zawiya, a dozen families of Znaga, ﬁve hundred Haratan (of whom a quarter to a half are soldiers), maybe two thousand ‘Abid. One of the Hassane families is dominant over the others, and is headed by the emir who is the absolute ruler of the city.''
''RELIGION''
''Khalidi culture does not appear particularly pious: they lack overt demonstrations of faith, they do not utter familiar prayers and blessings with their speech, and their mosques are often plain and poorly maintained. To outsiders they explain that their faith is a personal and private matter. Those questioning a Zawiya are left believing that they are Muslim clerics, although a scholar would spot a lack of consistency with respect to observances with the Sunni, Shi’ite, or any other sect. They are closest to Khariji practice, the eldest of Islam’s variants. Such religious pretensions are a sham; the Banu Khalida in reality worship a trio of gods. The Zawiya and most of the Hassane know the truth about their deities — that they are demons — but over ﬁve centuries of indoctrination have grown convinced that they have the upper hand in the relationship. Most of the Znaga and virtually all of the slave castes are ignorant of the true nature of their gods, having been deliberately kept away from the darker aspects of demon worship. The upper echelons of the Banu Khalida are goetic sorcerers (Realms of Power: the Infernal, Chapter 11), summoning demons during their profane rituals and stripping them of their Might through the Ablating Art to extend their lives, heal injuries, and enhance their physical Characteristics and Abilities. The Gift is no more common amongst the bidan than in Mythic Europe and most gain their powers through demonic pacts. Few Hassane ever go to battle without multiple enhancements and powers; a duel between two Hassane is often determined by whoever can Summon and Ablate the most powerful demon rather than any actual skill at arms. The Zawiya use their goetic powers mostly to support the Hassane and exert control over the lower castes; through the Commanding Art they construct and repair buildings and roads, and they Bind demons from the Order of Aerial Powers into stone pylons that dot Khalidi cities in order to keep the air cool and bring rain to the crops.''

==Khalida Characters==

''Players wanting a Khalidi character, particularly a goetic one, should check with the storyguide. Their casual relationship with the Infernal can make them challenging characters to play, particularly among a troupe of non-Khalida. The Social Status Virtues suggested here include both the European and Islamic equivalents (which can be found in Realms of Power: the Divine Revised Edition, pages 114–115) Hassane characters have either the Knight/Emir or Landed Noble/Muqta’ Social Status Virtues, depending on their closeness to the royal families. The most powerful, such as the Emirs of the Twelve Cities, are Diabolist Mythic Companions; other Hassane commonly have the Summoning or Ablating Goetic Arts (Realms of Power: the Infernal, Chapter 11). Zawiya characters should take Priest/’Alim Virtue. Like Hassane, many are goetic sorcerers, although they concentrate on the Commanding and Binding Arts. Znaga can take any Free Social Status Virtue; they have no special''
''rules regarding character creation. Haratan have the Freed Slave Social Status Flaw (see later). They usually have either the Warrior Virtue if they are a soldier, or the Educated Virtue if they are a bureaucrat. ‘Abid take the ‘Abid Major Social Status Flaw. Khalida names: Abisme, Alphaien, Burdel, Canabeus, Chernubles, Corsablix, Esperveres, Eudropin, Faldrun, Gemalfin, Guarlan, Jouna, Malduit, Marcule, Priamon, Timozel''
''FREED SLAVE''
''Minor Social Status Flaw You were either born a slave and have been freed by your current master, or you were born of two freed slaves. You bear a brand to indicate that you are not a runaway slave, but which also marks you as a lower class citizen. You can expect to be paid for whatever work you do, but it is likely to be a pittance, and your only way to avoid poverty may be to join the army or become a clerk''

|]
''WARFARE''
''The Banu Khalida are a warlike race. They do not conduct war for the acquisition of territory; they can carve as much as they need out of the torrid zone, limited only by the capacity of their priests to bind and command demons. They have little need for material wealth, having seemingly limitless gold reserves. Over the centuries Khalidi emirs have realized that sending their Hassane champions out to wage war on trade routes and nomad clans is the best way to prevent them from fomenting trouble at home. In the three hundred years or so that they lived in Iberia, there were''
''always Christians against whom the Hassane could test their mettle, but the Banu Khalida were forced to migrate to an area conquered and then vacated by their Almoravid successors. They must now travel further aﬁeld to ﬁnd opponents, which suits the emirs ﬁne.''

==Stories Involving the Banu Khalida==

''The Banu Khalida have managed to maintain a thriving culture built on the subjugation of demons for nearly two''
''centuries, and yet have not yet been destroyed by Hell for their temerity. That is not to say that they have any advantages that other practitioners of the black arts lack; Khalidi sorcerers are just as prone as others to disastrous botches and Vituperation. Simply because of the number of sorcerers operating in each city barely a year goes by without a demon breaking free and running amok. While the interests of individual demons are certainly not served by permitting the Banu Khalidi to continue existing, the interests of Hell most certainly are. Without access to a Divine faith with which to seek redemp''

He cannot gain a positive Wound Penalty from this power, and the beneﬁt only lasts while his opponent is still alive. The power has a base Penetration of 0, but the wielder can generate a Penetration Total using his own Penetration Ability; it is especially easy to gain blood as an Arcane Connection. This power is equivalent to a 25th level effect.''

Encumbrance: 1 (3) Appearance: Nearly seven feet tall with ebony-black skin, Jurfaret shaves his head and paints his face with red ochre before going into battle.

''Jurfaret is a young Hassane who seeks renown as a warrior. He empowers himself by preying on the ghosts of those individuals he defeats in combat, and often seeks out particularly skilled opponents to test himself against. However, he is haunted by the remnants of the ghosts he has tortured for personal glory, and the stress of their constant presence at the edge of his perception has left him nervous and in possession of a strange compulsion to close jars, doors, shutters, chests, and other places where spirits might hide. Rules for Summoning and Ablating can be found in Realms of Power: the Infernal, pages 114–117; Hassane can cull experience points, Conﬁdence points, or increased Characteristics from ghosts, or heal his wounds. He gains Warping and Infernal Reputation for these deeds. These statistics reﬂect ﬁfteen such victories, and has left some of his Abilities tainted by his sinful methods.''
''tion, even the lowest member of Khalidi society is vulnerable to sin. The Unholy Trinity are amongst the upper echelons of Hell’s hierarchy, and are able to simulate patience in pursuit of the bigger picture, especially with the help of the council of twelve emirs and the senior Zawiyas. As is all too common with demons, the individual goals of Mahound, Termagant, and Apollyon are generally at odds with one another, and the emirs exploit this to create a stalemate in which the Banu Khalida state is permitted to continue. Mahound is principally focused on apostasy. It sends missionaries to northern lands to corrupt the faithful, but is also most watchful of visitors to the Twelve Cities, looking for opportunities to engender a fall from grace. Termagant wants blood to be spilt, as much and as often as possible. This demon has most inﬂuence amongst the Hassane, driving them to acts of meaningless violence. It also promotes callousness toward the slave caste, encouraging the bidan castes to consider them little more than livestock. Termagant is always on the lookout for new sources of slaves. Apollyon is obsessed with greed; it creates gold to encourage merchants from the north to come here for trade; it corrupts them before sending them back. False Gods like Apollyon are able to summon riches from thin air, but this gold is invariably stolen from somewhere else.''
''North Africa is divided into four bands, each of which suits a different type of transport for merchants, or groups of magi with supplies. The fastest travel is by ship along the coastline. To the west lie the Atlantic coastal cities of Mauritania and to the east, along the Mediterranean, stretches the old Roman province of Cyrenaica. The largest cities of the Maghreb lie in a fertile strip often called the Tell, and here carts are the fastest means of overland trade. Further south lies the High Plateau, which rises into the Atlas Mountains. In these regions, horses predominate. South of these lies the Great Desert. For most travelers, this is the land of camels.''

''The swiftest way to travel in the Maghreb is by ship. The largest cities are near the coast, and ships frequently pass between them for trade and the transportation of pilgrims. Travel over water is also much safer than land travel. The advantage is so great that it is faster to travel to many Christian ports in Europe by ship, than to other North African cities by land. Piracy is currently relatively rare in this region. The rulers of the southern Iberian coast have a powerful navy, and use it to punish disruptions to the sea lanes.''

==Story Ideas For Pirates==

''The presence of powerful and effective enforcement of naval law does not mean there is no piracy in this area, just that it takes a less overt form than in other parts of Mythic Europe. There are''
''no pirate bases, with full time crews of outlaws; piracy in North Africa is more pernicious.''
''THE MERCHANT HOUSE''
''The easiest way to be a pirate in North Africa is to run a merchant house already, and use piracy as a lucrative sideline. If pirates kill all witnesses, or sell them as slaves in distant ports, then send the seized ships to other foreign ports to begin legitimate trading, the ship is unlikely to be recognized as stolen. If pirates steal the cargo from a vessel, and use it to ﬁll the hold of a ship already known to carry similar goods, then who is to know the cargo is bloodstained? The key is to be subtle: take one ship, every so often, using a hand-picked crew of men who will not talk about where they earned their gold. Most of the time, just pretend to be a merchant. Player characters can be drawn into this when a vessel is taken and an important passenger — a redcap, nobleman, merchant prince — is put to death. They are asked to help ﬁnd the missing person. Alternatively, their supplies may be in a ship which vanishes, and they seek out answers.''
''ROBBING THE IFRANJ''
''It’s easier to capture local ships than to attack Christian ships far from the North African coast. One of the advantages pirates have over their victims is that they carry few supplies. This means they can ﬁll their holds with additional warriors, and these make the melee against the defending crew so much more certain. A ship traveling to Italian waters, for example, needs to sacriﬁce some of those men for supplies. That''
''being noted, pirates robbing the Ifranj gain respect in some parts of North African society, and can even be given formal recognition if war breaks out. Player characters can enter this story either as raiders or pirate hunters.''
''MAKING IT PERSONAL''
''A pirate can avoid the wrath of the emir of Seville by not attacking the ruler’s interests. In this story seed, the last scion of a noble house ﬂees to sea (or is kidnapped and sold as a slave) after the rest of his family is destroyed. He (or she) becomes the leader of the pirates, and begins raids on the ships of the people he feels are responsible for the destruction of his family. The pirate leaves pilgrims unharmed, has excellent manners, and explains to all who listen that these are acts of personal vengeance. Technically, the emir’s navy should destroy this pirate, but naval campaigns are ridiculously expensive, and the pirate’s not harming the emir. Player characters may enter this story as allies of the pirate, if they have a shared foe, or by assisting the people he is attacking. They might instead act as investigators on behalf of the real scion of the family, who didn’t ﬂee to sea. He became an apprentice in a distant covenant, or a companion to the player characters, and wants to know who is using his name, and why.''
''MERCENARY PIRATES''
''No Muslim nobleman would ever hire pirates, ofﬁcially. Pirates are scum, and are hated by every right thinking person, ofﬁcially. Just before war between local nobles, however, it is often''
''advantageous for each side to disrupt the other’s trade. Some, unsubtle, people just have elements from their navy go pirating. Others hire mercenaries, using secret and dependable servants. These mercenaries can be merchants, but are often from the fringes of society: dhimmis, Christians from other lands, or marginal groups like magi. If characters are offered this role, they know to prepare for war. Even if they do not hoist the pirate ﬂag, they can use the confusion to settle scores, gain resources, and protect their interests.''

==Punic and Roman Sites==

''The Phoenicians and Romans both established numerous colonies along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of Africa. The Punic communities grew ﬁrst, favoring rocky promontories overlooking deep natural harbors, optimal for the seafaring culture’s explorers, mer''
''chants, and navies. These towns grew over the course of seven hundred years, trading and growing, becoming a part of the landscape and building the nation that would draw the ire of what would become the greatest empire since Alexander. The rivalry between Rome and Carthage became so rancorous that the Roman Senator, Cato the Elder, ended every speech to the Senate with the comment, “Carthago delenda est” — Carthage ought to be destroyed. Their ﬁrst war began in 264 BC, with the ascendant Rome supporting a usurping band of mercenaries against the dominant naval power of the Mediterranean at the time, Carthage. Twenty-three years of conﬂict left the Republic the new lord of the western waves and Carthage preoccupied with repulsing independent mercenaries who were attempting to overrun Sicily. They clashed again in 218 BC, in 17 years of conﬂict that saw Hannibal march elephants into Italy. Ultimately, a lack of reinforcements allowed Rome to survive and endure. Fifty years later, Rome took the role of aggressor, culminating in the siege and destruction of the city of Carthage itself. The conquering Roman legions ﬁlled the vacuum left in the wake of of the Punic''
''empire’s demise, occupying its former colonies. The Republic enlarged most of these settlements, using the newly incorporated provinces of Numidia and Mauretania as a favored region for retired legionnaires. Fresh arrivals developed the countryside, subdividing the coast into Mauretania Tingitana, Mauretania Caesariensis, Numidia, and Africa Proconsularis, or Cyrenaica. Many weathered the tribulations of the Empire to succumb to the ravages of the Vandals, only to be reconquered by Bellisarius and then later claimed by the Islamic expansion. Ruins lie scattered all across the Maghreb, from Sala Colonia (now Rabat) on the far southwestern Atlantic coast, to Cyrenaica on the eastern Mediterranean coast, not far from Egypt. Most surviving communities fell to the Arabs as they swept across the land. The army either conquered cities and made them a part of the Caliphate or simply left the remnants in place to be reclaimed by the sands. The Romans’ two primary roads began in Tingis, now Tangier. The ﬁrst, the Northern Road, follows the mountains east to Carthage, now Tunis, and then snakes along the coast, going all the way to Alexandria in Egypt. The second, the Western Road''
''runs south to Ad Mercuri and the ruins of Augustus Zilil before it splits in two, one fork following the ocean to Rabat and the other to Volubilis, now called Walili. The Northern Road network reaches ﬁngers out all along the coast from mansion to villa to fort to city, a stony spiderweb grown over 700 years of Roman governance. In most places, the roads are more valuable than the dressed stone, and so looters ignore them and take masonry from ruined buildings instead.''
''MAURETANIA TINGITANA''
''While there are some abandoned ruins like those at Lixus or Iulia Valentia Banasa, many of the Roman and Punic sites in this area are still occupied, such as the coastal cities of Ceuta, once the Roman military town of Septa, or Mlila. In cases where the town remained inhabited, much of the former Roman architecture has been recycled for building materials, leaving only a few monuments or fragmentary structures. In places like Banasa or Lixus, locals have only scavenged some of stone over the centuries, leaving the ruins fairly substantial. Larger surviving communities include Tangier and Walili, formerly Volubilis, both discussed later.''
''MAURETANIA CAESARIENSIS''
''The region which would later be called “The Tell” saw a large number of colonia established in the temperate hills and valleys. Roughly eighteen communities follow the curves of the Northern Road along two forks. Some cities, towns, and ruins of note include Sharshal, Saldae, Tlemcen, Algiers, Djemila and Tifesh. They are discussed later.''
''NUMIDIA''
''This was the region most densely colonized by the Phoenicans and Romans, and the majority of the area had already been seized after the Romans crushed Carthage at the end of the Third Punic War. Rome annexed the rest of Numidia after the Berber client king died and civil war erupted. Rome now governed all of the coast from the Pillars of Heracles to Alexandria, and would later claim Egypt. Numidia consisted mostly of the eastern Tell and Tunisia. It included Carthage, Constantine, Soussa, Bouna, Tbessa and ruins like Lambaesis and Tamagudi. These sites are discussed further later.''

==Wine, Women, and History==

''For those in search of the history of the Maghreb, few reliable sources exist. One of the most respected and oft-quoted is Ibrahim ar-Raqiq, an 11th century courtier, diplomat, and secretary to the Zirid Princes of Ifriqiya. He is also known for his texts on the less scholarly topics of wine, women, and song, such as Quṭb asSurūr (On Wine). His legacy as a historian, however was cemented with the rare and valuable Tarikh Ifriqiyya wal-Maghrib:''
''The Tarikh Ifriqiyya wal-Maghrib (Arabic) Summa Area Lore: Maghreb (Level 4, Quality 10), Tractatus Area Lore: Great Desert (Quality 10) Author: Ibrahim ar-Raqiq, 11th century historian. Availability: The private libraries of merchants and nobles in Maghreb and Al-Andalus. Description: Of particular interest to Seekers are portions detailing the Fatimid caliph Ismail al-Mansur’s military operations in the Tahert area. The Caliph visited the jedars at Jabal Lakhdar and asked for the translation of the dedicatory inscriptions; ar-Raqiq reports the interpreter stated the monuments celebrated a military victory by the Byzantine army of Justinian I. While this is incorrect, the text does accurately note the locations of the thirteen great Berber tombs located in the hills south of Tahert.''

==Arc Seed: Imperial Legacies==

''The Romans quickly and inexplicably abandoned many of the region’s ruins at the end of the third century. While the Berber tribes may have had a hand in this departure, they had been present for a thousand years, and had not previously forced an exodus. Can ancient Roman ghosts be summoned to provide clues, possibly revealing an incident involving the great Hunger Spirit precipitated by Mercurian wizards who meddled with things best left undisturbed? Are the libraries and scrolls of the former priests still hidden in their sanctuaries or secreted away in forgotten refuges? Perhaps some fragments of the fabled network of road-magic? Magi or Seekers coming to investigate Maghreb’s ruins may ﬁnd more than they bargained for, as a large pack of bouda have moved in from the south and plan to pick the region clean.''

==Story Seed: A Pirate Crown==

''A legacy of independent rule is not easily forgotten, even after 150 years, and the pirate culture of Anfa secretly hopes to throw off the yoke of the Almoravid suzerain. Until the time is right to act on their plans, the pirates secretly subvert and undermine the regional governor’s endeavors. A canny Tytalus may recognize the potential for machination, and take up Anfa’s cause, working with the pirates-cumconspirators to make independence a reality. An even more devious rival may reveal the possible rebellion to an opposing Tytalus, using the situation to draw a target into the open.''

|]
''CYRENAICA''
''The Cyrenaica region borders the deep deserts of Libya and has few cities. It does have a large number of forts, and nearly 2000 fortiﬁed farms built by the Legio III Augusta. The defensive line of the Limes Tripolitana survived in some form into the 11th century, protecting the cities until the nomad warriors of the Banu Hillal Arab tribe overran the area. Within a few decades, the area was nearly abandoned to the sand and wind.''

==The Western Coast==

''The Western Maghreb region hosts several unusual sites, like the island of Mogador, nestled along an Atlantic coastline dotted with cities such as Anfa, Asﬁ, or the twin cities of Rabat and Sale. This is temperate coastline that occa''
''sionally suffers vicious winds laden with biting sand sweeping out of the dunes to the east, but also sports fertile plains and hills that help communities thrive.''

==Anfa==

''Anfa has a deep harbor and a strong wall surrounded by verdant farmland and overlooked by the tall tower of the great mosque’s minaret. Like other cities along the coast, it was originally a colony established by Carthage and later incorporated into the Roman Empire. Its population consists primarily of Berbers, and from the seventh century to 1068, Anfa rejected rule by the Caliphate and created a city-state called the Kingdom of Anfa. The Almoravids, however, surrounded and conquered it, incorporating Anfa into their empire. Throughout all that time and to the present, the city has remained a haven for pirates raiding the Straits of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean. It is not simply a raider’s port of call, however. Anfa is a bustling port, trading saharan goods, grain, and fabrics with many European cities, includ''
''ing Seville in Iberia and Genoa in Italy. All of this combines to create a very tolerant and cosmopolitan environment that, if not welcoming to foreigners, is most certainly not hostile. Some might consider Anfa the secret entrance into the Maghreb, one jealously guarded by those merchants who frequent it.''

==Asﬁ==

''Asﬁ is an ancient Punic colony, and the residents are renowned for their high quality pottery and rich ﬁshing grounds. A trusted and valued trade partner with Marrakesh, its deep harbor is often quite busy with merchant vessels bringing in manufactured luxuries from Iberia or exporting exotic goods from beyond the Great Desert, and with trawlers hauling in their nets. The Suﬁ mystic Abu Mohammed Salih, or Al-Mighri, makes his home in Asﬁ, with an established ribat and the nascent foundations of the Magiriyyun order. At 67 years old, he is beloved by the town elders. If your saga follows history, he will live another 14 years, teaching Suﬁ''
''ascetics and writing his book Bidayat al Mourid, a record of Tassawuf, the mystic inner aspect of Suﬁsm and the lives of certain suﬁ saints, like Al-Maghri’s teacher Abu Madyan. The city claims a strange legend as the origin of its name. In the early 11th century, a large group of sailors accidentally made landfall on the Hesperides. They collected a number of souvenirs before the natives captured them, blindfolded them, and sent them back out on the waves with a storm on their heels, compelled to never set sail again once they arrived at their next port. Lost within the blustery winds of their captors’ curse, the crew ﬁnally stepped on to the docks of Asﬁ and asked where they were. The locals told the mariners they were months away from their native land al-Andalus. Upon hearing this news, a sailor responded by saying, “Wa asaﬁ” (Oh, my regret). The great geographer, Al-Idrisi stated the city was called “Asaﬁ” from that point forward. Many of the descendants of these sailors still possess the relics their ancestors smuggled away from the Hesperides, including several accounts of how their ship arrived. For those seeking a way to reach the mythic destination of Heracles, these tales may prove priceless.''

==Island of Mogador==

''Noted in the Periplus of Hanno, the primary account of his expedition, the island of Mogador was renowned as the source of a speciﬁc sea snail. When crushed and prepared, its shell produces a rare dye once used to stain the purple stripe on the togas of Imperial Senators. The secret of this dye’s production, reputed to create a terrible stench, is carefully guarded by the people who visit the island to harvest shells and live across the bay in the nearby town of Essaouira. The whole island has a Magic aura of 4 and remains uninhabited due to rumors of a bloodthirsty monster. A regio exists on the island, accessed through a ruined cellar door in an overgrown and crumbling Roman villa. In this regio, the Roman villa exists as it did at the height of the Imperial period, peopled with the descendants of the craftsmen and autocrats dedicated to the production of the dye for the Emperor.''

==Story Seed: Punic Ghosts and Roman Ruins==

''The necropolis of Chellah is ideal for magi seeking out ancient spirits. There are few prying eyes to question the acts of the investigators and there is little interference from Divine auras, as the necropolis is surrounded by a wall and separate from the city proper, which mutes the sounds of prayer from tthe few remaining residents. Few will question open graves or active digging within the complex, and the ancient nature of the structures and area mean magi will likely ﬁnd what they’re looking for, if it is here. Ghosts of those Punic dead buried in antiquity may prove difﬁcult to question, however, unless the summoner has managed to learn the language somewhere or can cast Thoughts within the Babble with enough Penetration to defeat their Might. Those who speak''
''Aramaic may speak to Punic ghosts as if they had a Dead Language: Punic score of 3 lower (scores less than zero indicate no communication is possible). As a former Roman colony which was simply abandoned, there is also a chance several deﬁxiones might be found inside. The Romans used Sala Colonia as a launching point to seek out the Hesperides, and so Roman ghosts may be able to aid those looking for clues to the islands’ location. To the canny seeker, Chellah is a treasure trove waiting to be explored. However, what happens if a curious youth notiﬁes the authorities or a mundane grave robber decides to interfere, reporting the activities to the powers in Salé? Can the magi contain the situation before it grows out of hand?''

==Tales from the Wine Dark Seas==

''Those searching for the Hesperides or the mysteries of Atlantis, or simply wanting to push the boundaries of the known world for fame or proﬁt, may seek out stories of past explorers. Few are as famous as Hanno the Navigator of Carthage. The record of his journey only survives in translation, a book called The Periplus of Hanno.''
''The Periplus of Hanno (Classic Greek) Tractatus Area Lore: Beyond the Pillars of Heracles (Quality 6), Tractatus Magic Lore (Quality 6) Author: Unknown, originally Hanno Availability: Very difﬁcult to ﬁnd, usually in private collections in Tangier, Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople. Description: Translated from Punic to Classic Greek by an unknown scholar, this book discusses Hanno the Libyan’s journey out from Carthage and beyond the Pillars of Heracles with a ﬂeet of 60 ships. His route took him into the outer Ocean with Libya on his port side, and he continued on toward the west for 35 days. When he turned the ﬂotilla south, he encountered a terrible lack''
''of fresh water, intense heat, great hairy men, and “ﬁery streams running into the sea.”''
''STORY SEED: TABULA NON RASA''
''Hanno’s expedition returned with a tablet detailing the wonders and spectacles he found beyond the Pillars of Heracles, but it was lost with the sacking of Carthage. Hidden in the text lie speciﬁc clues necessary for avoiding the hazards Hanno faced and possibly ﬁnding the lost Hesperides or some other famous place, such as the Tin Islands. Construction or chance has uncovered a copper slate engraved with Punic text which may just be the actual tablet. Once deciphered, it could lead magi to a potential source of resources for their covenant which might be completely uncontested, but only if they are willing to plunge into the unknown.''

==Between Sand & Sea Rabat and Salé==

''The towns of Rabat and Salé straddle the mouth of the Bou Regreg river. The Almohads used Rabat as a staging point for their conquest of Iberia, building up the Rabatu l-Fath fortress, or “Stronghold of Victory.” Caliph Al-Mansur moved the capitol of the empire to Rabat in 1190 and began a great number of construction projects. He completed the great walls which surround it, and began the Hassan tower, an incomplete mosque intended to be the world’s largest, capable of receiving 20,000 faithful, but construction stopped with the caliph’s death in 1199. The tower stands 50 paces high, with internal ramps large enough to ride a horse up and surrounded by a forest of 200 columns supporting a cedar roof. Even in this partial state, the locals continue to use it as a mosque, and it has a Divine aura of 4. Al-Mansur also encouraged the conversion of the nearby abandoned ancient Phoenican town of Chellah, which became the Roman settlement of Sala Colonia, into a full-ﬂedged royal necropolis. He completed the reconstruction of Rabat’s Kasbah, an immense palace-fortress complex with its own mosque, situated at the mouth of the Bou Regreg. The enormous Kasbah has been deserted since 1199, save for a few squatters, and the aura of its mosque has faded. Al-Mansur’s heir, Muhammad al-Nasir, left the region to refocus on opposing the Reconquista and died in 1213. The current caliph, Yusuf al-Mustansir, appointed on al-Nasir’s deathbed, is a neglectful absentee lord who leaves the administration and rulership of the Maghreb in the hands of governors and viziers. This area is no different, and the bureaucrat who manages this region focuses his attention on Salé. Paired with Rabat, Salé occupies the northern shore. A stout wall surrounds the city, and rowboats carry brisk trafﬁc across the river at all times of the day and night. The settlement developed primarily as a result of the growth of Rabat in the last hundred years. A canal links the river to the Beb Mrisa souk, allowing some boats to sail directly into the souk.''

==Pithecousa, the Island of Monkeys==

''Not to be confused with the Island of Ischia near Naples (which was once called Pithecousa by the Greeks), Pithecousa is a legendary land ruled by monkeys that lies just off the African coast. Some say that it is found amongst the Balearic Islands or adjacent to Gibraltar, others claim it is through the Pillars of Hercules in the Atlantic Sea, still others place it within the expanse of the Nile Delta. In fact, any of these locations can be true, for Pithecousa sits within a regio that has several entrances. All these entrances are found at sea, within patches of unexpected fog. The regio has a Magic aura of 5. Those seeing through the regio boundary (Ease Factor 15, see ArM5 page 189) perceive a conical island looming from the fog, its slopes redolent with lush vegetation, and they can land on its beaches. At certain times of year, particular headings through the fog lead directly through the regio to the island without needing any special abilities.''
''ARRIVING ON THE ISLAND''
''Pithecousa has two enchantments that affect any who arrive on the island. All human characters (and other creatures affected by Corpus magic) on the island are targeted by a magical effect with a Penetration of zero that transforms everyone who does not resist into the shape of a mundane monkey. The type of monkey depends on the personality of the character; aggressive warriors tend to become hamadryades, clever characters become callithrices, and agile individuals become cercopitheci (see insert for details on monkey types). Unusual characters may take exotic forms. The character retains her Intelligence, all Virtues and Flaws, and all Abilities, but her clothes and equipment are not transformed, and are probably too big to use easily. Monkey characters are capable of communicating with other monkeys; they can understand but cannot speak a human language. A magus cannot properly form the Latin words of his spells, and is limited to casting spells with quiet words (ArM5, page 83). This transformation lasts all the time the''

''MONKEY VARIETIES''

For the statistics of a mundane animal, simply remove the Magic Animal Virtue, Magic Might, Magical Qualities and Inferiorities (including the Essential Traits, and Powers), and vis. Reduce Quickness by one. The generic name for a monkey is Simia in Latin. The statistics given above reﬂect a type of ape called the satyrus (a Barbary macaque to the modern reader), which is the most common type of monkey and the only one without a tail. Non-magical satyri are found throughout the mountainous regions of North Africa. Medieval bestiaries also distinguished four other types of monkey. Modern names for the monkey species have been provided in parentheses. There may be other exotic monkeys on the island that cannot be found elsewhere; like tailless black furred giants, or tiny creatures with immense eyes.''
''Cercopithecus: The Smallest of the monkeys on Pithecousa and an incorrigible thief, the cercopithecus has a shaggy reddish-brown coat and a long tail. It has white legs and underparts, a cap of brighter red, and black lines from face to ear. The cercopithecus is also found in Mauritania in open scrubland. Grey-furred versions with black faces are found in forests close to the Torrid Zone. Adjustments: Size –4 (change Str to –8 and Qik to +4), add the Minor Virtue (Light Touch) Magical Quality and the Minor Flaw (Carefree) Magical Inferiority. The cercopithecus also has the Fast Runner mundane Quality. (Patas monkeys and other guenons) Callithrix: The callithrix has a long white beard on its face, a long shawl of white fur over its back, and a white tuft on its tail; it is otherwise a black monkey. Unlike other monkeys, the callithrix lacks a thumb (represented by its Magical Inferiority, below). The callithrix is naturally found in the Horn of Africa, and is an occasional pet amongst Egyptians. Adjustments: Size –3 (change Str to –6 and Qik to +3), add the Minor Virtue (Perfect Balance) Magical Quality and the Minor Flaw (Palsied Hands) Magical Inferiority. (Colobus monkey) Sphinx: This is a docile beast with shaggy hair and a long tail; the males have an impressive lion-like mane and a colorful face — a red median stripe, blue muzzle, and yellow beard. The sphinx is native to the Empire of Ghana, but has been brought into North Africa by travelers. Adjustments: Add the Minor Virtue (Inspirational) Magical Quality and the Minor Flaw (Noncombatant) Magical Inferiority. (Mandrill) Hamadryas: These are also called the cynocephalus, but this would confuse them with the Magic Humans of the same name. The hamadryas is a ﬁerce monkey with a dog-like face. They are olive brown, although the males have a silvery-gray cape and mane of longer hair. The hamadryas naturally lives in the eastern deserts and highlands. Adjustments: Add the Minor Virtue (Berserk) Magical Quality and the Minor Flaw (Oversensitive to Threats) Magical Inferiority. The hamadryas does not have the Timid mundane Quality, replace its Brave –2 Personality Trait with Brave + 2. (Baboon)''
''characters are on the island, and causes Warping as a powerful mystical effect. Any Flaws the characters acquire from this Warping make them more simian. If characters want to dispel the magic, it is equivalent to a 55th level enchantment (approximately Muto Corpus base 10, +1 Touch, +4 Until (leaving the island), +4 Boundary). A Bjornaer magus may also use his Heartbeast Ability to end the effect. Anyone achieving human form is immediately affected by the second effect (see below). The second magical effect of the island is a ward that keeps out everything in human shape. This effect has a Penetration of 50. If this effect overcomes''
''the character’s Magic Resistance, then she cannot leave the beach on the landward side, nor physically or magically affect anything that is not on the beach. Anyone managing to transform into human form while in the island’s interior is immediately forced to head for the nearest beach if they fail to resist this effect’s Penetration. Partial reversions to human form (to allow proper speech, for example) must be adjudicated separately; as soon as the character has a recognizable human shape, the ward is triggered. This effect is equivalent to an 85th level enchantment (approximately Rego Corpus base 15, +1 Touch, +4 Until (leaving the island), +4 Boundary; +25''
''for Penetration 50). Magi wishing to explore the island probably need to suppress their Magic Resistance and accept the transformation. The origin of both effects is unknown; they seem to stem from the island itself, and derive from no form of magic familiar to the characters. Hermetic guidelines are given purely for investigative and dispelling purposes.''

==Story Seeds: Pithecousa==

''An island of monkeys provides ample opportunities for stories.''
''THE MONKEY’S FIST''
''The characters ﬁnd a strange object amongst other treasures: a spherical knot of golden cord known as a “monkey’s ﬁst.” Inscribed on the rope is the legend of Pithecousa, and it is enchanted with a minor Hermetic enchantment. Those familiar with the Order of Hermes may recall a famous Verditius called Verecunda from the covenant of Favonius (The Sundered Eagle, page 83), who is an expert in knots and has a monkey for a familiar. Verecunda made the item for the King of the Monkeys, as payment for one of his subjects as a familiar. The item was stolen from the king by a treacherous servant several years ago. That servant has now transformed himself into a formidable threat, but needs the Monkey’s Fist to return to Pithecousa and challenge his former monarch for the right to rule monkeykind. If the characters are trying to ﬁnd the island themselves, he disguises himself and pretends to help them, in the hope of getting his hands on the artifact.''
''A FAMILIAR APE''
''A character wanting a monkey as a familiar would do well to visit Pithecousa. A magus who befriends or abducts a monkey without the King of Monkeys’ permission is asking for trouble; the king dispatches his subjects to retrieve his subject, amounting to the Supernatural Nuisance Flaw. If the magus instead petitions the king, he’ll be asked to win his familiar in the following way. Monkey mothers always give birth to twins. She loves one of her children, but loathes the other. She holds the one she loves in her arms, and carries the hated one on her back. When pursued by a hunter, the monkey needs her hands free to climb, and is forced to abandon the beloved child in order to save herself. However, it often works out that the hated twin is a Magic Animal whereas the loved one is a mundane beast. The magus must capture the mother and retrieve the hated twin without using his magic or harming any monkey.''

''Characters arrive on the Island of Monkeys in time for the Ceremony of the King’s Urination. During the presentation of gifts (hopefully the characters have something they can offer), the characters meet the Embassy from Furthest Hind. These exotic monkeys are very''
''interested in the characters, and hope to use their friendship to get close to the king. Rather than ambassadors, these monkeys are actually shapechanged serpents working for the King of Punt, who hope to assassinate the King of Monkeys. Punt is the Egyptian name for Soqotra (see Rival Magic, Chapter Five), and the king there is a mighty serpent with far-reaching plans that might involve the player characters opposing the exotic sorcerers of that island.''
''THE DESCENT OF MAN''
''Members of House Bjornaer would be very interested in Pithecousa. The effect that transforms characters into monkeys works somewhat like the heartbeast, in that characters become monkeys that reﬂect their temperament. They can also avoid being forced into monkey shape by adopting their heartbeast. Pithecousa could easily be an Ancestor Site for the house (see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 25). If the mystics of House Bjornaer perform the Ritual of Twelve Years at the king’s court, they may ﬁnd local-born apprentices expressing any number of exotic African animals as heartbeasts, monkeys included. However, the King of Monkeys is unlikely to allow this disruption, and the characters might be dispatched back to the island to secure his cooperation, or failing that, his eviction.''
''EXPLORING THE ISLE OF MONKEYS''
''The island is mostly occupied by a single steep-sided mountain, although its slopes are rich in lush vegetation. Five rivers stemming from the plentiful rain have carved deep ravines into the mountain sides. The thick tropical forest is particularly rich in colorful unfamiliar ﬂowers and exotic fruit. There are plentiful iridescent birds, oversized insects, lizards, frogs, and ﬁsh. Hoofed and clawed beasts other than monkeys are unusually small: one can ﬁnd miniature goats, lions the size of house cats, and elephants no bigger than pigs. None of the predators pose a threat to the monkeys. There are no snakes at all; these are the traditional enemies of the monkeys, and have been hunted to extinction. Any brought in by visitors are met with both fear and violence. As one might expect, there are lots of monkeys here. Monkey society on Pithecousa is a parody of human society: the noble sphinxes rule over the peasant satyri, enforced and supported by the hamadryas warrior caste. The callithrices ﬁll in academic and clerical roles, and the cercopitheci are specialists, entertainers, and criminals. Most of the monkeys have Cunning rather than true Intelligence, and all the aping of societal roles is mere pantomime. A callithrix might make marks on a leaf like a scribe, but there is no meaning in them; a cercopithecus hammers at a rock industriously but he is not actually making anything. Visitors are treated with curiosity, except on the new moon, when monkeys are depressed and withdrawn. Characters may ﬁnd themselves under attack by enraged hamadryades if they wander into the wrong territory, or get caught up in a cercopithecus revel (they get drunk on naturally-fermenting fruits), or end up being arrested and tried before a court of sphinxes. Eventually, however, guests on the island ﬁnd themselves at the court of the King of Monkeys.''
''THE KING OF MONKEYS''
''The court is held in a bowl-shaped depression surrounded by date palms. A rock in the center of this natural amphitheater is the king’s throne. He is sur''
''rounded by his counselors and guards, who are drawn from all ﬁve kinds of monkey and several more exotic examples. The king himself has characteristics of all his subjects: he is tailless like the satyrus; he has the facial markings of the sphinx; the mane of the hamadryas; the beard of the callithrix and the size of the cercopithecus. The King of Monkeys and his counselors are all Magic Animals; the king has Intelligence rather than Cunning and so do many of his court. The King of Monkeys may have a higher Might and further powers as beﬁtting a monarch of his race. On each half moon, the king receives tribute from his subjects. They form a line and bring him the choicest fruit, the shiniest shells, colorful rocks, and the like. Occasionally a monkey is noisily reprimanded by a counselor for the quality of the gift. The tribute is piled before the king’s rock; and anything that the characters lose (or have stolen) on the island is likely to end up here. On each equinox, the tribute is combined with the Ceremony of the King’s Urination. In great solemnity in front of his whole court, the King of Monkeys passes water seven times. All the monkeys watch with great interest but the purpose of this ceremony is not clear; observers have hypothesized that it might be some form of divination.''

==The Rif==

''The simple banded model for this region’s geography has one glaring exception: the Rif. The Rif is a triangular, mountainous spike which juts up from Africa, to create a thin strait at Gibraltar. It has several important towns. It is currently held by the Marinid, a Berber tribe who are opposed to the Almohads currently ruling Marrakesh. The Marinid dominance of this area gives them a staging ground for raids into Almohad territory, and makes trade with and administration of the Spanish territories of the Empire more difﬁcult.''

==Tangier==

''A city in the Rif likely to interest magi is Tangier. Under the Romans and Phoenicians, it was a modest port and trade city, but the Caliphate has grown Tangier into a busy maritime crossroads between Iberia, Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Great Desert caravan routes, maintaining a navy of sixty vessels. While it exports wool, hides, fruits, honey and wax, the city has a reputation for rough living, and St. Francis has called it “a city of madness and illusions.” Tangier was named after Tinjis, a goddess or giantess who married Heracles while he was on his way to perform his labors, bearing the city’s ﬁrst king. This king, a giant named Sophox, was buried in a barrow still evident in the city; any local can point player characters to it. Many Berber chieftains claim descent from Sophox. The Giant Blood and Great Strength Virtues are found in this area’s population, and since this society rewards victorious warriors, these claims may have some foundation.''
''TUMULUS OF ANTAEUS''
''Near Tangier, south of the city but before one reaches the mountains, stands the lonely tumulus of Antaeus, a titan or giant, depending on the source. Surrounded by a ring of 175 smaller menhirs, Antaeus’ grave marker rises ﬁve paces into the sky. Once the monarch of the region, many of the local kings have claimed descent from his bloodline. The Roman commander Quintus Sertorius supposedly found the site; digging it open, his men found enormous bones. Out of respect for their discovery, Sertorius made propitiatory offerings, sealed the barrow, and helped to magnify the tomb’s reputation by commissioning several epics. The learned Roman client-king, Juba II of Numidia (died 23 BC), who was husband of the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra, claimed his descent from a liaison of Heracles with Tinjis, the consort of Antaeus. This giant is interesting, if legends about him are true, as he is the offspring of a Magical creature and a Faerie. Also to the south lies is the Cave of Heracles, where the hero slept before''
''continuing on to ﬁnish his Eleventh Labor, slaying the dragon and recovering the Apples of the Hesperides. It has a Faerie aura of 4.''
''WALILI''
''The best examples of Roman stonework in this area survive in Walili, formerly the Imperial provincial capitol of Volubilis. Surrounded by fertile plains, the Berber king Juba II claimed it as his''
''capital and Latin was spoken there until the Caliphate conquered the populace in 790. When the aqueduct fell into disrepair, residents shifted their homes to a nearby wadi, and the former city became their cemetery. Many buildings still display intact mosaics and statuary from the Roman era; the main road, the decumanus maximus, is intact; and the impressive basilica, forum, and triumphal arch of Caracalla harken back to the lost days of the Empire. A Magic aura of 3 covers the ruins.''

==The Tell: Tunisia==

''The names for this region have shifted to match the lords in charge over the millennia. It has been called Massyli, Carthage, Africa, Ifriqiya, Tunis, and now Tunisia. It covers a broad expanse of territory, from modern-day Morocco to modern-day Tripoli.''

==The Marinids==

''The Marinids are portrayed as barbarians by Almohad loyalists, but that may not be true. Storyguides who prefer a rampaging horde, a bit like the Mongols, can certainly use the Marinids in this role, but there are other possibilities. In real life, the Marinids eventually did conquer the west of the Maghreb. From their capital in Fez, which they did not destroy when they ﬁnally invaded it, they ushered in an age of art and scholarship which, although it did not rival the height of the Almohads, was certainly superior to the court in Marrakesh in 1220. Discuss with your troupe what sorts of stories you’d like to tell, then pick a theme for the Marinids. The Marinids have one great weakness, if the player characters are maneuvering a faction against them. The dynasty remains coherent if it continues to successfully raid, or expand. If plunder, or conquest, ceases, then each Marinid warlord considers expanding his power by destroying his cousins and appropriating their followers. Characters who can stall the expansion of the dynasty can force it to change form. Through a period of internecine war, the Marinids can be transformed into a uniﬁed, but far smaller, force.''

Imghrawn wields a huge cudgel of acacia wood, studded with chunks of green-white desert glass. He keeps a miserable camel, which carries his personal hoard of salt, gold and trinkets. Occasionally, he leads a chain of slaves, but these are usually traded for baubles, or infrequently eaten.''
''Several important cities thrive within Tunisia, such as grand Marrakesh, bustling Fes, Tunis, once the city of Carthage, the holy city of Kairouan, and the vibrant port of Tripoli. Pirates are rife along the coasts, operating out of harbors in Mahdia, Sfax, or even the abandoned wharves of Girba on the island of Djerba. This fertile region of North Africa is often called “the Tell.” Characters traveling by land in the Tell may use wheeled vehicles, drawn by horses, donkeys, oxen, or camels. Donkeys and horses travel faster than oxen, but can carry or pull less cargo. Wheeled vehicles are worse than useless in the mountains and desert, where camels are preferred.''

==Marrakesh==

''The largest city in the region, and most inﬂuential, is the source of many story ideas. Called the “Red City,” for the ochre-colored earth used in so many buildings, the sultan Abu Bakr founded Marrakesh at the foot of the Atlas Mountains in 1062 and it has served as the capital for numerous regional rulers. Its great marketplace and souk, the Djemaa El Fna, serves as the functional and social heart of the city. Exotic baubles from the deep desert, Christian slaves from Europe, slaves from the south, gold and salt out of the desert, and goods from all across the Maghreb may be found in the tents and stalls of this massive bazaar, mingling with more than a few faeries plying the crowds as merchants, performers, or street urchins.''

==Story Seed: A Claim to the Throne.==

''The giant Imghrawn believes he should rule a swath of the Maghreb as his birthright. To achieve this, the giant thinks he must emulate Antaeus, and raise a temple fashioned from the skulls of his defeated foes. He has decided to start with a fortiﬁed ksour village and its oasis, established nearby and tasked with providing the covenant with dates and livestock. The ksour’s population must be rescued from this brute before he slaughters them all for a delusion. Alternatively, the covenant may decide to support the giant, and begin a bloodthirsty campaign of slaughter and conquest, drawing the attention of local governor’s forces and tax collectors and initiating a very strange conﬂict in the area.''
''Pharsalia, Book IV (Latin) Tractatus Area Lore: Maghreb (Quality 6), Tractatus Magic Lore (Quality 6) Author: Marcus Annaeus Lucanus Availability: Difﬁcult to ﬁnd, in heirloom collections in Italy, Iberia and Constantinople. Description: This text details the story of Heracles’ victory over Antaeus. the tale is told to the Roman Curio by an unnamed Libyan citizen who regales the author with the wide-ranging battleﬁeld, the strength of the titan, and the demigod’s eventual triumph.''
''VIRTUE: OF KINGS AND GIANTS, ANTAEUS’ BLOODLINE''
''Major or Minor Supernatural Virtue Those who enjoy the gift of Antaeus’ Bloodline manifest its attributes in several ways. Depending on whether the Major or Minor version is taken, the character ages as per the Faerie Blood Virtue (Minor) or the Strong Faerie Blood Virtue (Major), but also exhibits other traits. In its Minor form, the individual may have one of the following: a +1 to the Strength characteristic (but no greater than +3), +1 to the Brawl ability, or +1 to Soak. In the Major version, the character has all beneﬁts, and also gains the Large and Magic Sensitivity Virtues, as well as the Major Flaw, Greater Malediction (Must be Touching the Ground). If prevented from touching the ground, the character loses the bonuses, and reduces his Soak by 2; however, he still remains physically the same size. When chosen, the player decides if this bloodline is Magical or Faerie aligned, and cannot change this alignment later.''

==Story Seeds==

''Travel is always a great source of stories, and this is particularly true in North Africa.''
''THE ROADS OF ROME''
''The player characters, once they become established in North Africa, become a resource for other magi wanting to explore the continent. A Bonisagus magus who wishes to rediscover the secrets of the Cult of Mercury seeks out the player characters. He wishes to examine the Roman road network of North Africa, as it is more intact than that of Europe; in some deserted areas it remains entirely undamaged. If the player characters begin digging up the old Roman roads, they draw the attention of noblemen, and the Bonisagus magus is entirely unsuited to dealing with them.''
''THE TAKERS OF TAXES''
''Merchants who travel in North Africa are subjected to various taxes as they enter and leave the domains of the various rulers. It is a sign that a ruler is corrupt if his representatives take more than they should, or destroy the merchant’s cargo while assessing it. Right thinking men are almost required to taunt, fool, embarrass, and harass these tax collectors. Characters who do so are considered heroes by the poor. These stories are particularly suited to companions and grogs, and provide an excellent opportunity to introduce potential allies or enemies of the covenant, who respond accordingly to the action or inaction of the player characters. This interaction sets the scene for later negotiations, when the covenant comes seeking particular hardto-ﬁnd goods or services.''

|]
''The Sultan’s fortress redoubt, the Kasbah, overlooks the Djemaa El Fna while a hospice, mosques, the Imperial palace, parade grounds and a garden all ring this gorgeous monument to local prosperity. Caravans regularly arrive, passing through one of the city’s nineteen gates and bringing both trade from distant lands and Suﬁ mystics who wish to study and debate with the local ascetics inside the impressive walls. Many Suﬁ mystics use caves in the Marrakesh’s surrounding hillsides as shelter, coming into Marrakesh on Fridays for communal prayer. Since the 1180’s, when the Sultan Abu Yusuf Ya’qub al-Mansur began construction of the Koutoubia Mosque and a renovation of the Kasbah, Suﬁs have been welcome and encouraged in Marrakesh. Now, the area around the mosque is rife with booksellers who cater to the proliﬁc Suﬁ authors.''
''STORYGUIDE TIP: DESCRIBING MARRAKESH''
''Marrakesh is the most opulent part of the Maghreb. Local bricks are often carved from pink stone. Gardens are a luxury, so they are particularly common here compared to other cities. When describing them, emphasize greenery, ﬂowing water, and shade. This is the best city for fantasy elements inspired by The Arabian Nights, many of which are neither Arabic nor medieval. Marrakesh is also the city with the deepest shadows. The empire is crumbling. Many people are using the confusion to settle scores. Others are having as much fun as they can before society collapses, even if that makes the Empire fall that little bit faster. Thieves here are particularly proﬁcient, by birth, as are assassins, by training. When you need a setting or character on the ﬂy, choose something to do with the court, or with the criminal classes.''
''AN EMPIRE IN DECLINE''
''This city is the capital of the Almohads, whose empire seems to be in decline. The Empire suffered a crushing defeat in 1212 at the Battle of Al-Uqab (Las Navas de Tolosa). Over 100,000''
''soldiers, mostly loyalists from the African territories of the Empire, were lost, along with the revenue from most of the Iberian territories. This has been followed by a series of defeats closer to home. The most recent occurred 1217, outside Fes, where Marinid tribesmen defeated the Almohad army, and were only prevented from taking the second city of the Empire by a lack of skill in siege warfare. These Marinid forces still control the Rif, and the rulers of Marrakesh seem unable to dislodge them. The current ruler is a seventeen year old boy. He is incapable of providing charismatic leadership to the nobility of his kingdom. Instead, an oligarchy of his close relatives control the parts still within his effective power. These relatives constantly feud. A group of governors, who still accept the ruler’s suzerainty, but in an increasingly nominal way, rule more distant territories. These include: Ab Muammad Abd al-Wahid bin Yusef, the governor of Sijilmassa, Yusef ibn Ali, the governor of Tinmal, Abdul-Wahid, the viceroy of Ifriqiya, Abu Zayd bin Yujjan, the governor of Tlemcen, and Abu Zakariya, the governor of Fez. Additionally, the governors of Al-Andalus and the island of Majorca might have designs on the title of Caliph, in an attempt to move power across the Strait to Iberia. None of these governors wants to be the ﬁrst to break away. The Almohads might still have one good battle in them. Refugees ﬂeeing Iberia might have revitalized the core Almohad cities, allowing them to ﬁeld a more powerful army than expected. They might cut a deal with the Kings of Castile for aid. This means that each governor needs to answer a call to arms. At the same time, no governor wants to lose his best followers or his treasure in supporting the Almohads until the next crisis comes. All a governor need do to be independent, or perhaps even the next ruler of Marrakesh, is to make sure that someone else exhausts himself while destroying the Almohads.''

==Saga Seeds==

''The decaying empire offers many opportunities for storytelling. Some require a little political meddling, which must be handled carefully to avoid breaching the Code.''
''A NEW RULER''
''The player characters are approached by one of the cousins of the ruler. He may live in Marrakesh, or be a prisoner taken into Christian lands after capture at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. Players in this saga ﬁnd ways to kill the other claimants to Almohad rule, while avoiding blame, and diverting mounting suspicion. While hollowing out the oligarchy, the player characters may place appointees more loyal to them than their patron. They may also need to complete stories that help hold the Empire together, so that their patron inherits enough to repay his debt to the player characters.''
''AIDING A GOVERNOR''
''The Empire is declining, but no clear successor has emerged. Even without direct military intervention, magi have a great deal to offer any of the regional governors. They can spy on rivals, assess their plans, perform sabotage, improve the local economy, and allow their patron to strike his enemies in times of weakness. Player characters who succeed in these ploys eventually have substantial connections in the new capital of North Africa.''
''INVITED IN''
''The Almohads are desperate to keep their kingdom together and are trying all kinds of things to bolster their economy. Most recently they have tried importing vast numbers of Christians, and even some Jews, from Spain, settling them in Fes. They are seeking treaties of alliance with Christian monarchs, even those with whom war is so traditional as to be almost a duty. A cousin of the ruler may seek out a redcap, and send a message to''
''the Order that some dhimmi magi would be welcome to settle in the new foreign quarters of Fes. Player characters who are skilled diplomats could stretch this invitation. The Almohads are desperate enough that the right to settle elsewhere, and some ﬁnancial assistance, could be extracted. This might be particularly generous if the magi are willing to reclaim areas only nominally held by the Almohads, like the Rif.''
''REVENGE AGAINST THE ORDER''
''House Flambeau has always hinted that it might be in some way responsible, with the possible assistance of God, for the stunning victory at Las Navas de Tolosa. Many other magi assume they meddled in the outcome. The Islamic forces suffered up to 150,000 casualties compared to 2,000 Christians, mostly from religious ﬁghting Orders whom the Flambeau ﬁnd inconvenient. Characters wanting to operate in Morocco need to remember this history: elements of House Flambeau quite likely broke the rules about annoying mundanes on''
''the basis that there was no-one left to harm their sodales. Even if they did not, they are strongly suspected of having done so. Player characters coming to Morocco are entering the home territories of those who want revenge for the battle that cracked the Empire. Conversely, player characters who strongly identify themselves with the Order may ﬁnd they have ready allies among those gnawing at the Empire’s edges.''

==Virtues for the Thieves of Marrakesh==

''The City of Marrakesh is named from the words “to cross over” or “to hide.” Some digniﬁed scholars claim that this is because it was a fortress that watched over the whole country. Many locals disagree, and say it was a tribute to the skill of the horse thieves who used to raid this camp, crossing over the walls and then hiding with the livestock. People from Marrakesh who choose to follow this profession, are just innately better as thieves than other people.''
''Some local wise men suggest that they all share the blood of some legendary hero. Characters need only take Virtues which suit them to crime if they use these Abilities frequently. Virtues which particularly suit thieves include: Afﬁnity with (Athletics, Awareness, Legerdemain or Stealth), Cautious with (Athletics, Awareness, Legerdermain or Stealth), Intuition, Keen Vision, Light Touch, Perfect Balance, Premonitions, Puissant (Athletics, Awareness, Legerdemain or Stealth), Ways of the Town.''
''ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''Once per session, a player whose character has this Virtue can reroll a botch die. The character has prepared, in advance, for this exact failure and has a contingency plan, which the player must describe.''
''FALLS LIKE A CAT (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''The character is not injured by falls of up to three times his height, or six times his height if he can soften his fall by catching on windowsills, breaking through awnings, or hitting branches on the way down. At greater heights the character suffers Impact damage of +1 for every additional foot, if landing on a hard surface, or for every additional four feet, if landing on a soft surface.''
''INDESCRIBABLE FACE (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''After meeting this character, other characters usually ﬁnd it hard to describe him sufﬁciently well to separate him from others. Some forgettable characters are just average height and weight, with unremarkable features. Others have a particular feature which is so striking it crowds out other memories. He has an ostentatious hat. She was carrying a little dog. The characters can recall the striking feature, but little else. A player who selects this Virtue for his character needs to select which form of the Virtue his character has.''

==The Pavilion with Three Items==

''When the characters capture a thief who has violated their covenant, the man offers to give them a tale of great treasure in exchange for his freedom, a treasure he swears to be true. Given the chance, he tells them of a pavilion in the garden of a house in Marrakesh. The house belongs to three brothers, who have never entered the pavilion, as their father forbade it on his deathbed. Inside there is a sheepskin rug, a cap, and a hashish pipe. Each of these items is magical. The sheepskin transports the person who sits upon it, in the blink of an eye, to the place they request. The person need not have seen the place, and it the instruction can be conditional, such as “Wherever the person who stole my trousers has gone.” The sheepskin travels with the user, so they are not stranded unless it is taken from them. The cap makes the wearer invisible. The wearer is still audible. Similarly, he can be detected by animals''
''who have a strong sense of smell, like dogs. Items worn or held by the wearer are also made invisible, but it does not affect mounts, nor does it hide objects, like statues. The hashish pipe, when used, does not emit smoke when the user exhales. Instead, it transforms the smoke into small gold ingots. These are of apparently limitless supply, but there are two limiting factors. The pipe actually needs to be smoked, so the characters will eventually run out of hashish, although they can use the ingots to buy more. Further, as the pipe needs to be smoked, the person using it is not in his right mind. The character is placed under the control of the storyguide, who is encouraged to create stories centering on the humiliation of the character. Characters using the hash pipe often get themselves into terrible trouble using the other two objects. This is why the merchant forbade the pavilion to his sons.''

|]
''A character who is simply average is always forgettable. He can’t turn the ability off and may use props when building a Reputation among other criminals. He may be “that guy in the black gloves who strangles people,” for example, although no-one recalls precisely what he looks like. Intimately related characters can eventually become sufﬁciently used to the character’s forgettable face that they remember it. A character who distracts with a prop is memorable when she wishes to be. She can simply not use her devices of distraction if she wishes to make an impression. She can also switch her distracting prop. For example if she hears that someone is looking for a lady with a curious dog, she might switch to a baby, or a curious hat. A character who distracts with props is usually not recognized by random people in crowds (whose eyes also follow the prop, not the face), but this protection is less perfect than a truly forgettable face.''
''JUST AN INSTANT (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''A character with this Virtue, who has had a few seconds to look about a room, does not need to make Awareness checks to detect or remember anything of interest on the room’s exposed surfaces. Some characters use this Virtue to discover the layout of a space so they can navigate it in the dark, while others use it to save time while stealing. Characters with this Virtue are also useful lab assistants, because they know where everything is, and are aware of experiments about to critically fail.''
''FINDING HIDDEN LOOT (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''A character with this Virtue gains a +9 bonus to Awareness rolls when searching a conﬁned space for hidden items, provided they can move the contents of the space about undisturbed.''
''RAT UP A DRAINPIPE (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''Using a mixture of acrobatics, climbing and dodging, this character can run through urban areas as if unobstructed. This gives a substantial advantage''
''in opposed Athletics rolls, which represent being chased.''
''SCHOOLED IN CRIME (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''The character has been trained extensively in the criminal arts, and has 50 additional experience to spend on Abilities related to thievery. Area Lore, Athletics, Awareness, Bargain, Brawl, Charm, Guile, Legerdemain and Stealth are all suitable, and other Abilities may be added to this list with troupe approval.''
''SEES IN THE DARK (MINOR SUPERNATURAL VIRTUE)''
''The character suffers no penalty for activities in low light, or even complete darkness, making Awareness rolls without penalty.''
''SKILLED SMUGGLER (MINOR GENERAL VIRTUE)''
''The character can hide one item on his person, and attempts to ﬁnd it suffer a –9 penalty on Awareness rolls. The item cannot be larger than a dag''
''ger, and the character may swap which items are hidden with a few minutes of work. Wealthy characters often procure collapsible tools to use in conjunction with this Virtue.''

==New Sample Childhoods for Those Raised by Thieves==

''If a player is using the Detailed Character Creation Rules given on page 31 of the core rulebook, she may wish to use these suggested childhood Ability sets.''
''Child burglar: Awareness 2, Bargain 2, Native Language 5, Stealth 2. Child grifter: Charm 2, Guile 2, Legerdemain 2, Native Language 5. Child lookout: Awareness 2, Legerdemain 2, Native Language 5, Stealth 2. Child runner: Area Lore 2, Athletics 2, Legerdermain 2, Native Language 5.''

==The Sons of Sāsān==

''In Arabic folklore, including the Maghreb, there are stories of a shadowy organization that nurtures bandits, thieves, murderers, prostitutes and other criminals. It is said to have arisen when a Persian prince named Sāsān lost his kingdom, and in his wanderings and depredations drew about himself a family of evildoers as retainers. The descendants of this court of villainy form a tribe, the Banû Sāsān, and aid each other against outsiders. They are said to be ruled, in each city, by a Beggar King. They are said to have tainted blood which aids in their crimes, they are said to run schools for each other’s children, and they are whispered to have unhallowed places where they perform dark rites, to gain the power to commit greater evils. Most criminals claim to belong to this group, although how tight a family this clan really forms will vary between sagas. All criminals in the Magreb know an argot (called the monōḡāt Banī Sāsān) which is based on Arabic, but ﬁlled with loan words, particularly from Persian and Kurdish. Much like Cockney slang in English, its allows people of a certain class to demonstrate kinship with other people of that class, and private communication of basic concepts while in the presence of outsiders. Much like Cockney slang, however, it is clear to listeners who speak only the more broadly used version of the language that the character is speaking an odd and incomprehensible dialect. Characters with a criminal background and an Arabic skill of at least 3 have the ability to speak the argot.''

==Fes==

''Fes is the second city of the Empire, and has been invigorated by the arrival of refugees from Iberia.''
''STORYGUIDE TIP: DESCRIBING FES''
''Fes has the oldest university-like school in the region, and was, for centuries, the Imperial capital of North Africa. Even the laborers of Fes are interested in quoting the sayings of the Prophet to each other and discussing what they mean. The color green is particularly prevalent in Fes. Mix that with areas ﬁlled with tiles of a deep blue, placed in perfect geometric shapes, so that as the sun washes across them they become reﬂective and luminous. When describing Fes, emphasize how venerable parts of it are. Contrast this with how fragile it is. Three years ago Fes almost fell to the nomads. The last time a nomad tribe raided North Africa they pulled all the cities down, and destroyed all of the aqueducts, on the basis that cities were nothing but''
''resupply points for their enemies. In other parts of the Maghreb the decline of the Empire has led to squalidness, as people temper their fatalism with hedonism. The faith of the people of Fes guides them away from the sordidness found in other towns. The age of the Madrasa (a word which means “school” but in this case refers to something similar to a university) can also be contrasted with the new areas of the city. Many refugees from Iberia have settled in Fes. Aside from the Muslims is a vibrant Jewish quarter, and a surprising number of Christians. A local who wants diversion from his life can go to the new quarter. There, he hear music played on new instruments, discuss novel ideas, and eat food made with weird ingredients. This quarter is, in a very real sense, what rich locals do instead of bars and brothels.''
''Art and Academe, which describes European universities, has many plot hooks suitable for play in Fes.''

==Tunis==

''The city of Tunis is the largest port in the Maghreb. It has been a center of trade, and also of naval power, for the Almohads since they invaded this part of Africa in 1057. The loss of al-Andalus weakened the Almohads, preventing them from supporting the stronger navy they once possessed.''
''STORYGUIDE TIP: DESCRIBING TUNIS''
''Tunis is strikingly white. Particularly under the sweltering African sun, the city’s whitewashed walls seem unnaturally clean. The doors of many houses are painted ultramarine. The layout of the markets in this city has been carefully considered. The central mosque is surrounded by the markets for perfume (north), cloth (west), wool (south) and dried fruit and booksellers (east). Other markets circle outward in rings, becoming increasingly unsanitary as the characters enter poorer areas of the city.''

[|

==Al-Kairouine Madrasa==

''In the eighth century a pair of sisters, heiresses to a wealthy merchant, moved to Fes from Kairouan. One of these women used her inheritance to build a mosque. With the aid of other emigrants from her home city, this mosque was so well provided for that a school could be opened. By 1220, it is a great center of learning, drawing students from the Arabic world, and from the small communities in the Christian kingdoms of the Mediterranean. Students are taught theology and Islamic law as core subjects. Many others also learn the Artes Liberales and practical subjects. Some stories suggest that a few teachers are astrologers, or in some other way magical. The traditional form of the lecture in these universities is that the teacher sits in a chair, and the students gather about to hear the lesson. In times of plenty, the living costs of students at Al-Kairouine are covered by subsidies from the institution or donations from rich nobles or merchants. During the current difﬁculties, students need to ﬁnd ways to supplement their income. They have many skills which are of use to Hermetic covenants. All are literate and are able to navigate mundane society. Many have useful Area Lores, and some have (Realm) Lore scores, generally favoring the Divine.''

==Vis Source: Figs of Two Colours==

''Outside Fes there is a ﬁg tree which bears fruit out of season. Some of its fruit are white, others are black. If anyone eats the black fruit, horns emerge from his forehead (Monstrous Appearance Flaw.) The horns are also terribly sensitive, and cause the bearer great pain if struck. If the victim eats the white ﬁgs, the horns retract and disappear. It is said that a leper once married the daughter of the Sultan of Fes by tricking the ruler into eating the black ﬁgs, dressing as a foreign magician, the offering him the white ones as a cure. Some Hermetic hearers of this story may wonder if this leper was a magus, and where his tomb lies. The ﬁgs themselves contain Muto vis.''

==Vis Site: Molting Beetle Husks==

''In a hidden canyon wadi, a day’s travel east of Marrakesh, scarab beetles of Virtue gather to shed their skins and dry in the bright desert sun. The husks are a sparkling indigo hue, and some Tuareg use them to dye their veils. When the husks are gathered in the late summer, after the sirocco has swept through the canyon, four pawns of Muto and Imaginem vis can be found. However, these husks also produce the most vibrant colored veils, and the nomads in the area prize them. Any magus attempting to acquire this source will need to come to terms with the tribe. It will not do to simply promise them the husks once the vis is removed, as this process destroys the useful properties of the shed carapaces. Aggressive actions may result in unpleasant future consequences for the magi, as this tribe often serves as guides to southbound caravans, and hold grudges across generations.''

|]
''This means that the settings in which scenes may take place become more steadily more physically sordid the further characters get from the rich center of town, in a way entirely predictable to the residents of the city. Tunis faces a lake, and depends on the ocean, so proximity to the water is also an important thematic element. When you need to rapidly choose a character or setting, consider something to do with sailors, the navy, or the water.''

==Tripoli==

''Tripoli is “the gateway to the Great Desert,” the primary port in the gold and slave trade in the eastern Maghreb. It was originally a Carthaginian port called Oea, which eventually absorbed two neighboring cities and changed its name to reﬂect that it was three (tri-) cities (polis) combined into one. It is now the port most friendly to dhimmis, as it is dependent on their trade, even for sufﬁcient bread to feed itself.''
''STORYGUIDE TIP: DESCRIBING TRIPOLI''
''In most other cities in the Maghreb, people describe the medinas as ﬁlled with twisty, narrow streets, but Tripoli is an exception. Characters used to the cities founded by Romans in Europe will see many features in the layout of Tripoli that are familiar. For example, the city is divided into four quarters by two great roads that form a cross. At the center of the cross are a mosque and a fortress. Most of the city is the color of yellow sandstone, although parts are pink and the fortress is red. Tripoli has the remnants of many cultures, layered one above the other. It was settled by the Phoenicians, refounded''

==Saga Seed: Rebellious Governor==

''As described in the earlier section about the decaying empire, many Almohad governors wish to rebel. None, however, wants to spend men and treasure to exhaust the forces of Marrakesh, only to be conquered by another governor who has kept his forces intact. If your saga’s history follows that of the real world, the most successful rebel is the governor of Tunis. For the Hafsids, the governing family of this and several nearby towns, to gain independence, they need to keep circumstances favorable. This generates many stories for magi supporting their ascent to power. To successfully rebel the Hafsids must juggle many factors.''
''ALMOHAD NAVY''
''The sailors of the Almohad Navy also serve as a large force of light infantry. It is impossible for the Hafsids to rebel without killing inﬂuential captains in the ﬂeet, or luring them away from Almohad service. Ambushing captains on land is easy, but suspicious. Defeating them at sea is more difﬁcult, but easier for a Hafsid puppet-ruler to cover up. This hook motivates stories of intrigue, assassination, and combat.''
''TRADE WITH ITALY''
''Trade with Italy is vital to the hopes of the Hafsids: disruption for as little as a year could end any attempt at rebellion. Desert goods ﬂow out to the Christian lands, providing money that is used to maintain armies and political support. At the same time, Tunis cannot support itself without wheat imported from Sicily. Without regular shipments, the people will starve, riot, and serve anyone who can promise an end to the famine. This hook motivates travel, to the sources of Italian and desert trade goods, and to clear up disruptions in supply. It also motivates diplomatic stories. In the real world, slightly after 1220, Italian city states started founding embassies in Tunis, to compete for shares of the market, and the favor of the ruler.''
''CONQUER TRIPOLI''
''In the east of the Maghreb, two ports trade, in some volume, with Europeans: Tunis and Tripoli. To increase their power, the Hafsids could draw both ports under their suzerainty. This is less difﬁcult than it appears, because Tripoli has only a weak navy, and no great agricultural hinterland. Tripoli is even more dependent on imported wheat than Tunis is: a blockade for six''
''months might be enough to starve out the Almohad governor. Keeping Tripoli subdued is difﬁcult, however. A trustworthy governor is particularly important, as is diplomacy or war with the desert tribes.''
''STORY SEED: THE SERPENT OF BAGRADAS RIVER''
''Magi seeking a covenant site may research the stories of North Africa, and discover that a suitable place lies just over twenty miles north of Tunis, at the mouth of the Bagradas River. Historians record that during the ﬁrst Punic War, a Roman general fought a serpent which had a lair there. The battle took hours, even though he deployed his entire force and their siege engines. Once the beast was slain, its skin was shipped to Rome, and measured 120 feet long. Magical creatures, by their nature, prefer to make their homes in Magical auras. For a creature to rest inside an aura, it must be larger than the creature. Therefore, it’s clear that a site of at least of moderate magical power, 3 or greater, and of sufﬁcient size to build laboratories, exists at the mouth of the Bagradas River. Characters exploring the site may face lesser serpents, the ghosts of Roman soldiers, or their reanimated bodies.''
''by the Greeks, traded with by the Egyptians, conquered by the Romans, taken by the Arabs, invaded by the Normans, and now is back in Berber hands. The practitioners of most Western schools of magic had time to establish colonies here. Given that the Normans were partially Christianised Norse warriors who had stopped off in northern France for a generation, even druids and Odinites might have made it to Tripoli. Magi, and other knowledgeable seekers, can ﬁnd remnants of the various layers of mystical occupation in this city. Characters created on the ﬂy should have some sort of link to ruins or artifacts from the earlier rulers.''

==Other Communities of the North Central Tell==

''These are towns and communities located nearer to the northern coast of the Maghreb.''
''SHARSHAL''
''Offshoots of the old Roman Northern road connect the main causeway to Caesarea, or Sharshal as it is now called, and Saldae, the current city of En Nassria. Both are busy ports along the Maghreb coast and have seen the bulk of their Roman structures recycled into the current buildings.''
''TAHERT''
''In a high, central pass sits Tahert, a lightly-populated terminus of the slave trade better known for the many ruined stone tombs, called “jedars,” to the south. It once supported a sizable community of Jews, though only a few remain. The people here never truly recovered after being conquered by the Fatimid Caliph in 933. Tahert is currently ruled by the Governor of Tlemcen.''
''TLEMCEN''
''Tlemcen, once the small fort town (castra) of Pomeria, has since grown into an inﬂuential terminus of the Great Desert caravan routes. Families, like the al Makkari, manage it and ensure the great wealth of the desert continues to ﬂow into the coffers of the Caliphate. This wealth brings construction, and nearly all of the Roman construction in Tlemcen has since been reincorporated into the many buildings and the protective wall.''
''ALGIERS''
''Initially a Phoenician city, then Roman, and currently occupied by the kasbah of Algiers, Icosium was founded by twenty companions of Heracles. Dominated by whitewashed architecture, and built right to the shoreline, Algiers has several Roman cemeteries in the sea-cliffs to the west, and a high wall. Like Tlemcen, the wall recycled large amounts of demolished Imperial masonry when Arabs rejuvenated the site in 942 AD.''
''RUINS OF NOTE''
''Abandoned but spectacular ruins still stand in places like Djémila, located at the conﬂuence of two rivers, where there are arches, partially standing basilicas, a pair of fora, crumbling houses and temples, as well as a beautifully preserved amphitheater, and the forgotten mountain fortress of Tifesh, with its 3-pace-thick outer walls and three crumbling basilicas. Either of these sites, with a remnant Magic aura of 3, might serve as a site for a covenant.''

==Other Communities of the Eastern Tell==

''These are towns and cities located in the region near Tunis and its coast. The ruins of Carthage proper are discussed in greater detail later.''
''QUSANTINA''
''Able to resist the Visigoths, but conquered by the Arabs in the seventh century and renamed Qusantina, the former city of Constantine now supports a prosperous market with connections to Pisa, Genoa and Venice. Fondly called''

==Story Seed: Lost Virgilian Magics==

''The mosaics and auras hint at the presence of a previously unknown cabal of Virgilian sorcerers who once called Hadrumetum home. Fleeing the onslaught of the Arab army, they left a number of their texts and handiwork in the catacombs for safekeeping. Unfortunately, they never returned and their lost notes may lead the characters to Soussa. However, as the magi begin their investigations, they learn someone else is also searching the crypts. Do sahirs, infernalists, renegade Hermetics or the Augustan Brotherhood stalk them within the tunnels?''

==Kairouan==

''Kairouan is the fourth most holy city in Islam, and non-Muslims are forbidden to enter large sections of it, on pain of death. One of the oldest mosques, and certainly the largest, in North Africa stands here, believed to be the model for all of the other mosques in this region. This mosque acts as a focus of pilgrimages and religious study. Kairouan has the highest Dominion aura of any city in the Maghreb. Kairouan’s reputation as a center of learning, and as a court for the exilarchs of the Jews, was destroyed after the city was sacked in to 1057. Reconstruction remains incomplete. The Jews have ﬂed Kairouan, mostly to Egypt. Its scholars decamped to Tunis. Lost libraries may be found in the ruins, hidden in the sudden escape.''

|]
''“the City of Bridges,” Qusantina sits on a high plateau surrounded by a deep ravine, with several bridges and a treacherous natural rock arch crossing the cave-riddled gorge of the Rhumel river. The nearby hilltop ruins of Tiddis include an entry arch to a well-preserved complex of paved streets, a Mithraeum with a Magic aura of 3, cisterns, and a small forum. This site would serve as an excellent basis for a starting covenant in the area.''
''SOUSSA''
''Founded in 1100 BC by the Phoenicians, Hadrumetum was one of the most important communities within the Roman territory in northern Africa because of its strategic location on the sea in the heart of Numidia. Now called Soussa, it allied with Rome early in the Third Punic war, and ﬂourished until the Arabs arrived in the 6th century. The army of Oqba Ibn Nafîi utterly destroyed the city, leaving nothing of the last 1700 years standing. The conquerors renamed the site Soussa and rebuilt using the debris, but the legacy of the Punic and Roman heritage was hidden under the new city. Many mosaics showing the poet Virgil, fantastic creatures, or Hellenistic gods survived, and the Roman and Christian catacombs still exist beneath the streets. Some areas of the catacombs strangely maintain a Magic aura of 4.''
''BOUNA''
''Hippo Regius grew from a colony ﬁrst settled by the Phoenicians in the 12th century BC; it garnered the appellation Regius, “of the King,” after serveral Numidian kings erected pyramid tombs there. Situated near the mouth of the river Ubus, it became a major city in Roman Africa, famously known as the bishopric of Saint Augustine of Hippo in his later years. Many synods and councils convened in Hippo, helping establish the accepted books of the New Testament. It was conquered by the Arabs in 698, but they left the ancient site in the ninth century and moved a league north, calling the new city “Bouna Al Haditha,” or Bouna the New. The abandoned ruins include the largest theater''
''in Africa, and the mostly destroyed Basilica of St. Augustine. The shell of the Basilica still contains a saint’s relic (with 3 Faith Points) beneath the rubble of the altar, and offers a Divine aura of 3 within the structure.''
''TBESSA, LAMBAESIS, AND TAMAGUDI''
''To the south, military roads lead from Qusantina and Bouna to Roman Theveste, now Tbessa, and the nearby legionary town of Lambaesis; both possess extensive Roman remains. Tbessa is surrounded by a Byzantine wall with thirteen square towers, and its ruins include an amphitheater, a nearly complete Temple of Minerva, and the remains of the basilica of St. Crispinus, which include chapels, baptism urns, catacombs and gardens. Lambaesis is unoccupied, but has triumphal arches, undisturbed Roman graveyards, dry aqueducts and''
''the skeletal remains of temples to Aesculapius, Minerva, Jupiter, and Juno. No Christian inscriptions exist in the town, and it still has a Magic aura of 4, centered on the temples. Of particular interest, a column in the encampment bears the complete text of Emperor Hadrian’s address to the Legio III Augusta. Only Tamagudi, seven leagues to the west, has better preserved ruins in all of Numidia, although roughly similar remaining structures. Hermetic wizards seeking to establish a covenant might be able to make the site habitable with some effort.''

==Vis Site: Heady Lotus Blooms==

''Found all over Djerba, the thorny lotus shrub grows very sweet berries, about an inch across with a hard seed. These are dried, processed into a sweet liquor, and eaten fresh. The berries grow from yellow or crème colored ﬂowers with a distinctive ﬁve-petal and ﬁve-stamen bloom. The Lotophagi grow stands of the Lotus of Virtue, creating the narcotic fruits which held Odysseus’ crew enthralled. Hidden in a secluded gully along a nearly inaccessible stretch of the shoreline, an unattended copse of Lotus of Virtue thrives. Collecting the ripe berries here in the morning of the summer solstice yields three pawns of Herbam and three pawns of Mentem vis. If three seeds of the Lotus of Virtue are enriched by exposing them to only the light of the full moon for a year, and then keeping them in a sealed amulet afterwards, the wearer gains the Clear Thinker virtue.''

==Story Seed: To Claim a Wife==

''In one of the villages south of Girba, the mosque is renowned for a very special reason. The locals always leave the mosque by dusk, lest they encounter the group of capricious jinn who appear in the early evening, always accompanied by their many beautiful wives. It is said that any man who can survive a night in the company of the jinn may take one of their wives for his own. The jinn demand any suitor succeed at a series of tasks which change for each hopeful. Sometimes they require feats of strength, other times they demand the answer to a medley of riddles, or the discovery of an out-of-place object, and occasionally they ask for an entertaining story they have never heard before. Those who fail become slaves of the Jinn, whisked away to serve them for seven years. The wives are sometimes jinn and at other times they are human slaves caught or purchased by the jinn, but they always remain beautiful, even after departing the mosque.''

==Islands of North Africa==

''There are relatively few Mediterranean islands along the Maghreb coast, but the two most prominent are Djerba and Malta.''

==Djerba==

''Continuously occupied since the Phoenicians ﬁrst settled it, this low lying island is one of the few along the north African coast. Once conquered by Roger of Sicily in the early 12th century, temperate and beautiful Djerba was the home of the Lotophagi, the magical lotus-eaters mentioned in the ancient tales of Odysseus. Known as Meninx by the Phoenicians and Girba by the Romans, villages and small communities litter''
''the landscape. On the north side of the island, the ghost town of Girba stands mostly unoccupied with its walls and structures in good repair; its only visitors are pirates and traveling merchants who meet with residents from the large village of Midoun to trade. El Kantara, known in antiquity as Meninx Proper, and Ajim, formerly the Roman town of Tipasa, occupy the opposite southern corners. Well-maintained Roman roads connect all three and a Roman era bridge stretches from El Kantara to the mainland. Local industries include weaving, agriculture, olive oil production, and ceramics. A very few craftsmen in El Kantara know the secret of creating the purple murex dye found only here and on the isle of Mogador. Several diverse groups call Djerba home. A league south of Girba, large group of Jews have lived in the village Hara Seghira since before the fall of the Second Temple. Built with stones taken from Temple Mount, the Ghriba synagogue is their religious and social center. Considered a pilgrimage site for Kabbalists and those wishing to celebrate the''
''holiday of Lag BaOmer, the synagogue boasts a Divine aura of 5. An enclave of Ibadi Muslims, similar to those in the oasis of Ghardaia, live in Ajim but shun outsiders and worship in underground mosques. The Lotophagi disappeared long ago, retreating into a few isolated regiones scattered about the island and marked by clusters of lotus shrubs. They avoid the current residents and appear very rarely to collect Lotus Fruit of Virtue on the Summer Solstice.''

==Malta==

''Currently a part of the Holy Roman Empire, as a holding of the House of Hohenstaufen, Malta is largely a fortiﬁed garrison, dedicated to its own protection at the detriment of nearly any other activity after alternately being mostly depopulated and then recolonized by Arabs before becoming a part of the Kingdom of Sicily. It has been a Phoenecian, Roman, Vandal, Arab, and even Norman outpost over the years. Three main islands comprise the''

==Story Seed: Cyclopskin Handiwork==

''A number of dolmens and ancient structures point to the race of singleeyed, sharp tusked giants which once lived on Malta. Their heavy wagons pushed deep ruts even into the stones all over the island. Occasionally, after a ﬂood or earthquake, a skeleton of one of these enormous cyclopskin is found. Legends state they disappeared long ago, before the Romans ruled Malta, but they did not leave. The giants retreated into regiones, seeking out the caves, like Ghar Dalam, and living beneath the land. Some claim recent earthquakes experienced by the island are the result of the giants at war deep in the earth. These regiones can be entered when the night of the winter solstice coincides with a new moon; explorers must delve deep into the rock of Ghar Dalam without light sources, eventually emerging into the subterranean vaults of the cyclopskin. Can the giants be convinced to stop their war before the cities above are shaken to the ground?''

''archipelago. They are Malta, the largest, Gozo, and Comino, the smallest. Tiny Comino is sparsely populated, with a few farmers and shepherds eking out a rough existence. Caves riddle the sheer limestone cliffs of the island, and a pious sorcerer named Kerrew often occupies them. However, he has a magic cloak which allows him to ﬂy, and he occasionally goes to the main island of Malta for extended periods. Pirates sometimes use the caves to hide before ambushing sailing vessels. When a group stays too long, often Kerrew appears to rout them with his magics and reclaim his subterranean sanctuary. These caves have a Magic aura of 4. Gozo is the second largest island of the trio. Local legends claim it served as the home of the nymph Calypso, daughter of the titan Atlas, who held Odysseus captive for seven years because of her love for him. While he was imprisoned there, she bore him two sons, Nausinous and Nausithous, as well as a daughter. His''
''Mythic bloodline occasionally surfaces amongst the population, with many of the women showing the Blessing of Venus or Great Presence, and at least one magus from this island claimed descent from Odysseus, bearing the power to manifest Aura of Rightful Authority. Evidence of Calypso’s titan relatives is most apparent in the form of the enormous stone structure at Ggantija. Built by a giantess and enclosed by a boundary wall, the clover-shaped complex and nearby stone circle sport Magic auras of 4. The giantess herself has not been seen in living memory. Some claim she sleeps in a nearby cave, awaiting the return of her lover. Malta has a strong Christian tradition, as Paul of Tarsus was shipwrecked on the island in 59 AD for three months and proselytized the inhabitants, healing the sick and founding the Christian community there. The Cathedral of Mdina, the capital, is dedicated to St. Paul and was extensively repaired after it''
''fell into disrepair during the Muslim rule of Malta. Both it and the nearby catacombs in the village of Ir-Rabat, where early Christians held their secret Mass, have a Divine aura of 5.''

==The Eastern Coast: Cyrenaica==

''Settled by Greek refugees from the volcanic island of Thera in the Aegean, the plains below the Jebel Akhdar (Arabic: “the Green Mountain”) were once known as the Pentapolis, a collection of small city-states initially dominated by the eponymous inland city of Kurene (known as Cyrene in Latin). After the Arab invasion of 643 the area became al-Maghrib al Adna (“the Nearest West”)''

==Kura, the Nereid of the Sacred Spring==

''Once venerated by the citizens of Cyrene, the nymph Kura has retreated to within her regio. She can be reached only by following the rivulet from her sacred spring upstream from where it joins the river that passes through the local necropolis on its way to the Mediterranean. Currently the only human aware of Kura’s ongoing presence is Zeynab, the youngest daughter of the village’s headman. The girl stumbled into the nereid’s regio last spring and has recently begun to visit the watery maiden regularly. Kura is ancient enough to remember the true appearance of the herb silphium (see later) and her local knowledge of the surrounding region may prove invaluable with any search for the remaining wild silphium groves above the city. She can be ﬂattered into helping with the quest through either sacriﬁce in her honor or restoration of her shrine, but as a genius loci she cannot leave the sacred precinct surrounding her spring. She may use Zeynab as her intermediary by using a Spiritual Pact and accepting the girl as her chosen Spirit Votary (see Realms of Power: Magic, pages 88–89) This powerful nereid may potentially be coaxed into becoming a patron spirit''
''for a Theban style covenant (see The Sundered Eagle, pages 30–31) in Cyrenaica, but is wary of Hermetic magi, having encountered hostile Berber and Arab wizards previously. Her price for any long-term arrangement will include adulation or veneration, even to the extent of demanding one of the magi submit to a Spiritual Pact and a promise to restore her public worship. Although adulation could be concealed, the open establishment of a pagan community within the ruins of Cyrene risks breaching the Code of Hermes. Whether such an infringement can be policed on the edge of the Hermetic sphere of inﬂuence remains uncertain.''
''STORY SEED: THE REMAINS OF THE DAY''
''The ruins of the lighthouse on the small island outside the harbor of Apollonia occupy the centre of a small strength 3 Magic aura. Within the structure are the remains of a makeshift Hermetic laboratory, including a shattered oversized glass lens, a recently slain human corpse and signs of a struggle with a giant sea creature, such as loose scales,''
''scaly imprints on the corpse, or slithering tracks in the sand within the room. Diurnum Lumen was a Flambeau magus who recently took part in a previous failed Hermetic settlement attempt in Cyrenaica led by Jerbiton magi from the Theban Tribunal, although the expedition was abandoned less than a decade ago. Diurnum remained behind at the pharos site, attempting to reconstruct it for use in recovering the secrets of the Lineage of Abydaros, a lost African mystery cult dedicated to Apollo and associated with powers drawing on the light of the sun. The Hermetic wizard may have been the victim of Glaucus, a murderous Makhai (Theban variant of a Muspelli, see Rival Magic) who venerates the sea Titan Okeanos and his brood of sea monsters. Although the powerful nonHermetic wizard has since moved on, searching the site reveals clues about his crime. Magi resettling the pharos site may be able to reconstruct some of Diurnum’s experiments given time but risk drawing a return visit from the malicious Titan’s proxy and bringing ruin on their ﬂedgling covenant.''

''rival, Ptolemais, toward the end of the third century AD. It declined over the next century as the population and provincial governor shifted to the coastal site. Although a small Roman and then later Byzantine garrison survived in the fort converted from the forum at Cyrene for some time after, there has been no recorded civilian population since the Arab armies passed through in the seventh century. The smaller town of Apollonia on the old Roman coast road about 20 miles from Sidi Rafaa was renamed Sozusa after the god Apollon Soter (“the Savior”). By the ﬁfth century AD the''
''town was nominally Christian, however, and several abandoned churches are sited within the crumbling walls. Three small islands lie off the Mediterranean coast — the largest was the site of the original Theran shipyards, the smallest once acted as the end of the harbor’s western mole, and upon the third island just outside the harbor stood an ancient lighthouse or pharos. The land around the town has subsided considerably, with much of the ruins lying partially submerged, and only a small village marks the stop on the old coastal road from Alexandria to Leptis Magna. The Genoese have recently established a''
''small outpost here, and started expanding trade in the area. The unfettered Magic spirit of Kura, the water nymph of the sacred spring near the Temple of Apollon, still haunts the ruins of the inland site of Cyrene. A temple to the Faerie god Zeus lies near the track of the ruined Roman circus and shrines to Demeter and Dionysos are located within the old city walls. This inland site is dominated by a Faerie aura of 3 but the immediate grounds of the sacred spring have a Magic aura of 5 that leads to the regio where Kura dwells. The ruins of the Olympian temples have a corresponding higher''

Its hide gives it a Protection of +2. Encumbrance: 0 (0) Vis: There are eight pawns of Animal in Muqadam’s mane. Appearance: A great tawny specimen, Muqadam is much larger than a regular lion, nearly as big as a moose or aurochs. His massive paws end in carefully sharpened, dark claws and his mane is full of small objects tied to locks of fur. His tail often swishes when he is irritated, or if lying down, his left rear foot twitches. His ﬂanks bear numerous scars and his right ear has a small notch in it near the peak.''
''Muqadam, the Barbary Lion of Virtue, is the greatest example of a creature often regarded as the largest and most impressive of lions. The Barbary Lion of Virtue exists to hunt and rule over the beasts of the Maghreb. He keeps a roaming court of creatures, attended by the lesser lords, weaker Lions of Virtue (See Realms of Power: Magic, page 60), Bears of Virtue, Jackals and Leopards of Virtue. Foxes and Griffon Vultures of Virtue often serve as his''
''heralds and spies, while Gazelles and Antelope regularly act as his messengers. His mane is covered in small tokens, Arcane Connections to members of the court and other vassals spread throughout his realm, given as a sign of their loyalty. A Barbary Ape of Virtue, Srba, acts as Muqadam’s valet and ties the tokens to his lord’s mane. The Lion tends to favor the Vultures over the Foxes, and the Antelope over the Gazelles. He considers the Leopards as peers, dislikes the Jackals’ attitude but appreciates their role, and ﬁnds the Bears both enigmatic and erratic. Muqadam distrusts humans, remembering the Roman practice of capturing Barbary lions for combat against gladiators. He hunts small groups of travelers, scattering their numbers and preferably taking mounts as a meal. Only when counterattacked does Muqadam strike out at people, but this has happened often enough that the tribes know to avoid certain regions if the Great Desert in the spring and autumn. Should Muqadam see a lion captured by travelers in the sands, his response would be absolutely furious and without mercy, with the captors’ lives forfeit. This has been the law since two of his cubs were taken years ago. Otherwise, in almost all ways, Muqadam behaves like Pentule, the Lion of Virtue described in Realms of Power: Magic, on page 60.''
''STORY SEED: AN ACQUIRED MENAGERIE''
''A group of Norman knights appear to''
''be tracking Muqadam across the countryside. Relentless, a powerful Jerbiton magus travels with them, providing the hunters with magical support, enabling them to survive the environment better than nearly anyone. They want to capture Muqadam, and place him within the menagerie of the Tower of London, where he will eventually suffer acclimation and likely die of shame. How do the characters react to this plan? Do they ﬁnd a way to surreptitiously help Muqadam, and gain the respect and future assistance of the beast, or do they aid the Jerbiton, and gain the favor of a potent Hermetic wizard?''
''STORY SEED: THE ROGUE VASSAL''
''A Lion of Virtue has begun hunting any and all men he can ﬁnd. This is Syyd, and he has decided that the spread of men at the edge of the Great Desert can no longer be tolerated. The Lion has been subtly corrupted by a demon that has preyed on his solitude and engineered situations where Syyd felt he was justiﬁed in killing. Now, bloodthirsty and uncontrolled, the Lion is ravaging the countryside. Will the magi seek out Muqadam and negotiate for the surrender of Syyd, or ﬁnd a way to acquire Syyd’s arcane connection from Muqadam?''

==Leptis Magna==

''Nothing in all of Africa compares to the unspoiled ruins of Leptis Magna. Built up by Septimius Severus, its native son ascended to Emperor, it has nearly perfect triumphal arches, a largely intact basillica, an expansive theatre and forum, and even a sea-side temple to Serapis with a Magic aura of 2. The harbor is guarded by a Byzantine wall, and a lighthouse still looks out over the water. Many of the structures are half buried in sand, further preserving them. Other than the occasional caravan encampment, Leptis Magna has no signiﬁcant inhabitants. Since the desert swallowed it, there is simply insufﬁcient agricultural land nearby to support a population.''

==The Jebel Akhdar==

''These coastal mountains, a plateau covered in the forests that give its name, are riddled with wadis, rivers, and natural springs, and the highlands are one of the wettest areas in North Africa. Although isolated Muslim villages are found throughout the hills, the Faerie and Magic creatures found in the groves and valleys here resemble more the nymphs and fauns of mainland Greece than creatures elsewhere in the desert regions of Libya, where ghul and jnun dominate. Myrtle trees and herbs grow in abundance here and, as a result, honey is easily harvested by the common folk. Tainted by the nectar of plants they have fed on in the many Magic auras scattered throughout the hills, the Bees of Virtue here produce honey with varying magical properties.''

==The Altars of the Philaeni==

''These two pillars set upon a small hill overlooking the easternmost point of the coast of the Gulf of Syrtis mark the ancient border between Carthage and the Greek colonies of Cyrenaica, and then later the line of division between the eastern and western halves of the Roman Empire. Legend claims the hill as the burial place of the two Philaenus brothers, athletic champions who set out in a running race to meet their Cyrenaican counterparts and thereby decide the border in Libya between the ancient powers. Accused of cheating, the heroes offered to be buried alive at the spot to conﬁrm their claim, an offer the Cyrenaicans accepted. From the nearby coast road, the tumulus containing the bones of the two Carthaginians appears as a simple hillock beneath the rise of the southern escarpment that is surmounted by two piles of broken stone. On the mundane level the site has a weak Magic aura of''

==Silphium, Asafoetidia or Fennel?==

''Silphium is perhaps the most famous herb of antiquity, once the lifeblood of the economy of Cyrene and found on all the settlement’s coinage, but it is generally believed to be extinct in 1220. Related to common fennel although much rarer, it was once found only growing wild on the coastal plains of Cyrenaica, resulting in a virtual monopoly for the lucky Cyrenes. The Emperor Nero is widely held to have consumed the last stalk out of curiosity, much to the lamentation of ancient herbalists. A similar but lesser herb, asafoetidia, is still found in Arabia, Syria, Armenia, and Persia, and exported to Western Europe. It is so often used as a replacement that it is often confused with true Cyrenian silphium. Known for its rank smell and the nickname of “devil’s dung” in many languages, this herb is a sticky resin extracted from the mature plant that imparts a delicious ﬂavor when mixed with oil in cooking. Although it has the same culinary qualities, asafoetidia lacks any obvious magical properties to European wizards,''
''leading some magi to speculate that the two herbs are the same species and that true silphium is merely the Virtuous form of this common fennel variant. Asafoetidia, known as tyib in Arabic, acts as a ward against jinn. A bag of the resin tied around a wearer’s neck acts as a Traditional Ward for some lesser Faerie jinn. Asafoetidia can substitute for myrrh in some contexts but has different Shape & Material bonuses:''
''Asafoetidia: Protect against evil spirits +3''
''SILPHIUM OF VIRTUE''
''Found now only in a handful of lost Magic regiones in the coastal mountains of Cyrenaica, a Silphium of Virtue can be enriched to act as a ward against poison (as the Greater Immunity Major Virtue) for a year. However, as a consequence, the owner suffers from infertility (as a Lesser Malediction Flaw) for the same duration, a side effect that increased the herb’s value''
''in antiquity as an effective contraceptive. Enrichment requires the owner to cut the stem, extract the faintly odored resin, and place it in a sealed jar of pine nuts for a season. The user must then consume a single pine each day throughout the year to obtain both the enriched effect and ongoing contraception. If not enriched, the heart-shaped seeds of a Silphium of Virtue collectively contain 2 pawns of extraordinary Corpus vis and can be instead employed as a ﬁnite use Lesser Enchantment that is an effective abortifactant.''
''Silphium Seeds of Corpus Vis PeCo Level 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Unborn Child''
''The seeds of a Silphium of Virtue can be crushed into a paste that can be smeared onto the belly of a pregnant woman, wounding her unborn baby and ending the pregnancy. If the mother is more than one month pregnant, a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6''

''2 but leads to a higher level 4 strength regio containing the twin pillars and accompanying blood-stained altars. Converted from a Carthaginian to a Mercurian site after the fall of Carthage, the regio is only accessible by using a Key to the Mystic Veil embedded in the northern pile of stone, and is sometimes visited to conduct initiations by the contemporary Cult of Mercury (see The Mysteries: Revised Edition, page 114–117). Together, the spirits of the Philaeni are considered inseparable daimonic Heroes with a pooled Magic Might 35, who can only be summoned through a combined theurgical rite performed by two wizards using Wizard’s Communion. The ghostly twin athletes once guarded the border road linking the North African provinces and were called upon to grant swiftness of travel to the legions traveling along their protected stretch of road. These Punic daimons can also be asked to grant the power to duplicate a recently cast spell, to enforce that the truth be spoken, and to bring down a curse on oathbreakers.''

==Siwa==

''This large oasis lies in a long depression at the northwestern edge of the Great Sand Sea, marking the ancient border between ancient Libya and the Kingdom of Egypt. In antiquity, the oasis was famous as Ammonium, the site of the oracle of Ammon, the Libyan god equated with Zeus by the Cyrenaican Greeks and consulted by classical heroes such as Hercules and Perseus, even Alexander the Great. Tracks lead north to the coast at Sallum (Baranis) and Matruh (Paraetonium), northeast to the southern Ayyubid capital of Cairo and southwest across the sandy desert to the Tuareg outpost of Ghat. This site will be described in greater detail in a later supplement for Ars Magica.''

==The Grand Plateau and the Atlas Mountains==

''The Grand Plateau is comprised of foothills and highlands that border the Atlas mountains. Some areas are sufﬁciently fertile to support large towns, but most areas are grazed by nomadic ﬂocks. Storyguides should use the plateau to tell the sorts of stories usually told in remote, rural areas in Europe. Although the Grand Plateau is close to the Tell, roads through it are poor, excepting a few major trade routes. The hilly nature of the country and the low population density have led locals to abandon the use of wheeled vehicles. Tracks through the plateau, suitable for riding horses or driving herds, are kept clear by locals.''

''This is baseed on the spell Black Anne’s Kiss that ﬁrst appeared in the Fertility Magic section of Ancient Magic, page 54–56. Target: Unborn Child is a unique Target that allows Hermetic magic to affect a developing human as Part of the pregnant mother. Investigating a Silphium of Virtue may provide an alternate source of Insight into integration of this style of magic into Hermetic magic at the storyguide’s discretion.''
''STORY SEED: WHEN SHALLOTS WILL SIMPLY NOT SUFFICE''
''A member of the Gastronomers’ League, consumed with the desire to win the honor of holding the Millenial Feast''
''of 1248 to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of Rome, seeks to obtain a sample of true silphium rather than employ common asafoetidia. As he wishes to keep his winning ingredient a secret, the magi or their grogs may be enlisted in the gourmet’s quest. The Gastronomer may be the head cook of Valnastium, a food-oriented magus from Normandy or the hedge magician Gervais d’Avignon. To make the search more interesting, the three contenders may assemble rival teams that uncover the sought after prize simultaneously or even inadvertently hire the same characters, providing opportunities for conﬂict, intrigue and negotiation.''
''STORY SEED: END OF THE LINE''
''Beyond its use in Hermetic culinary disputes, the ready availability of silphium with its use as a contraceptive has the potential to disrupt the feudal''
''structure of Mythic Europe. As per Lords of Men, a lord’s power is dependent on his serfs and their children, therefore any attempt to restrict the number of children is considered an act to limit a lord’s wealth. Similarly, contraception is considered a sin by the Church and contrary to God’s will. Enterprising magi determined to meddle in mundane affairs may attempt to use the infertility caused by silphium to break the true lineages of noble families or disrupt mundane inheritance in their favor. Tremere magi may seek to prevent the recovery of silphium by the Gastronomers to prevent the attention such a ﬁnd would bring to the order, to stockpile the herb for their own research, or to use the herb as a negotiating chip with the Redcaps of House Mercere. Unlike a Hermetic spell or invested item, using an enriched Silphium of Virtue does not leave the tell-tale trace of a magus’s sigil.''

''Once hunted to serve in the Roman gladiatorial games, Africa’s only native bear inhabits its namesake mountains and the surrounding areas, from Marrakesh to Tripoli. Brownish black in color with a reddish-orange belly, it''
''lacks the white mark on its short muzzle common to other brown bears. A stout, compact creature with powerful claws, it hunts wadis and brush alike, capturing anything it can to eat, but always on the prowl for a beehive.''
''The Atlas Bear of Virtue’s claws may be Enriched by wrapping their hide around a dry river rock taken from a wadi in the Bear’s hunting grounds and leaving them in the sun for 20 days. The resulting fetish grants the bearer the Tough Virtue.''
''STORY SEED: UNINVITED GUEST''
''A Bear of Virtue has taken over a vital supply cache or an essential vis site, turning it into a den and preventing any from entering. The covenant’s hunters, traders, or messengers need the cache to continue their travels, or the magi want to harvest the vis to continue covenant operations. Investigation reveals a group of Tuareg recently moved into the area, driving the Bear of Virtue from its previous home. Can the Tuareg or the Bear of Virtue move, or does the Bear need to be eliminated? Complicating matters is the fact the Bear is about to deliver cubs. Do the magi wish to try surviving without the site until the cubs depart, or do they want to neutralized the creatures for their own purposes?''

What estranged Gothic magic lineages roam the desert and do they possess the secret of changing into exotic Heartbeasts or other nonHermetic mysteries? Often ignored and left unstudied, hidden shapeshifter clans may roam across the Maghreb, descended from the tribes which crossed the straits, unwittingly awaiting a reunion or confrontation with the Bjornaer of Europe.''

==Between Sand & Sea Sijilmasa==

''The most signiﬁcant town in this region is Sijilmasa. It acts as the gateway to desert trade in the west. A similar role is played by Tripoli in the east. This city is a great center of fruticulture: the ﬁnest dates in the world come from the region around this city. It remains the last cosmopolitan destination for people traveling south, before the oasis towns of the desert. The wealth bought in through trade makes Sijilmasa a tempting target, forcing it to maintain heavy fortiﬁcations. During times of trouble, desert nomads raid it, so the locals fortify as a precaution. During times of peace, its rulers want to rebel against the central authority, and so improve their defenses. Stones face the brick walls of Sijilmasa. Currently ill-maintained, the walls are decaying from a high state of preparedness and sophistication. Much of the rest of the city is similarly ostentatious but dilapidated. Storyguides describing the city should imagine it was incredibly wealthy a century ago, but without necessary upkeep since that time. An Almohad army took the city by force last century, and the municipality is currently under the administration of an Almohad   governor. The Almohad desperately need the money from the desert trade to hold their Empire together. Locals believe the Caliphate will do virtually anything to control the city and loathe the Almohads for it. The Jewish community in Sijilmasa, for example, has vanished. Some ﬂed abroad, but the rest died in a genocidal pogrom, motivated either by religious fanaticism or, more likely, economics. Tall wooden wheels draw water out of the river Ziz, allowing most residents to maintain a household garden and ﬁlling a bathhouse attached to the largest mosque, where the Suﬁs come to discuss their philosophy. The Almohads jealously guard against popular Suﬁ mystics who might challenge them. They established many madrasas, which, combined with its great stone mosque, give the city a Divine aura of 4.''
''THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS ARE LIKE A FAERIE FOREST''
''When no other inspiration strikes, player characters should seek the Atlas Mountains. Much as, for European characters, the forest is the blank space where stories can always be found, in the North African imagination, there is always something new to ﬁnd in the Atlas. This region lies almost outside the law, and so it is a place for exiled princes to plot their return, bandits to recuperate between raids, and heretical sects to ﬂourish. Strange faerie towns and magical caves exist here, as do the houses of ascetics, the meeting sites of diabolists, the towers of wizards, and the tombs of forgotten kings. The Atlas were, perhaps, the fortress of the Titans as they made war on the Olympians, and they may be the shelter of the last remnants of coastal civilizations who ﬂed invasion by the Romans, Greeks, or Arabs. The mountains seem limitless, and beyond the sudden drop at their southern edge, lies the Great Desert.''
