''The Theban Tribunal is a curiosity in the Order of Hermes. As an organization it predates the founding of the Order, albeit in a very different form than today. It was originally much larger, but early in the Order’s history split in two, to form the Transylvanian and (modern) Theban Tribunals. Most distinct is its political system, which departs radically from that found in the rest of the Order. The Theban Tribunal is occasionally depicted as a model Tribunal, where magi live and work towards a common goal rather than being riven with strife and political bickering. More often, however, it is seen as an interesting anomaly rather than a model for the rest of the Order to follow.''
''Hermetic History''
''The lands that eventually became the Tribunal of Thebes have a long history of magicians. Rich sites of vis and the attentions of magical and faerie entities made fertile soil for arcane practitioners, and the natural geography provided hundreds of isolated pockets in which these magicians could co-exist. While the East may have had its “Dark Ages,” it never suffered the literary severing that the West did, meaning that Greek wizards were more literate than their Western counterparts. While their language evolved, it was not splintered into many different tongues like the West, and pre-Hermetic sorcerers could more easily communicate through letters, allowing them to cooperate if a specific venture proved fortuitous. The long-standing superstition that killing a wizard would curse the killer also helped. Such cooperative couplings predated the founding of the Order. Wizards in Greece and the islands would form temporary leagues —''
''groups that followed a charismatic leader or banded together for a common goal. Members found that the less they actually met, the better the league succeeded, and so relied on communiqués and individual assignment of specific goals. Once the goal was reached or the leader departed, the group would separate, retreating back to its members’ individual pursuits. While interesting to politically minded Theban magi, none of these early leagues merit individual mention.''
''Before the Order of Hermes''
''The wizard Prokopios preceded the founding of the Order of Hermes. In much the same way as Trianoma united the 12 Founders, Prokopios attempted to execute a similar vision among the wizards of Thebes. But lacking secrets to offer such as the Parma Magica and Hermetic theory, he had only limited success despite his Gentle Gift. Central to his scheme was a typikon — named''
''after the charter used by Orthodox monasteries — which regulated how wizards should act, how collective decisions should be made, and what sanctions could be brought against the foresworn. Prokopios claimed that the typikon was dictated to him by the spirit of Aristotle, who wrote copiously on politics in his day. The Typikon of Prokopios became the charter of the pre-Hermetic leagues; although it failed in its intended goal to unite the Greek wizards in a Panhellenic Congress. However, when the Order of Hermes came to the lands of the Greeks, the magi used the typikon as the foundation document of the Hermetic polity still practiced today in the Theban Tribunal. The first notable league was the League of Iconophiles, formed in the early eighth century to save religious icons from the Byzantine emperors who thought they should be destroyed. Thirty years into their struggle, the league’s leaders met Trianoma, and though declining her invitation, the League of Iconophiles serendipitously provided the origin for House Jerbition (described in detail in Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 40–1).''
''Shaping the Theban Tribunal''
''The expansion of the Order into the Byzantine Empire had little actual impact. The Order, primarily House Jerbiton, was only present in the major cosmopolitan areas of Constantinople, Thessalonica, and Adrianople, since the countryside was ruled by hostile powers — malignant faeries, capricious gods, bands of vampires and Infernal witches, and superstitious peasants — and magi settled where books, learning, and civilization were strong. Jerbiton magi were content to live alongside the various Gifted and unGifted practitioners who already existed, a détente born from the previous centuries of coopera''

''The Descendents of Prokopios''
''Prokopios’ numerous children and apprentices joined the Order of Hermes, and there are still some (principally in House Jerbiton, and among the Trianomae of House Bonisagus) who identify him as an ancestor. These magi claim that the Daimon of Aristotle is the daimon syggeneias (family spirit) of their line; and that he still offers them advice, particularly with regards to preserving the unique political system of the Theban Tribunal in favor of that of less-democratic Tribunals.''

|]
''tion between magical folk and the non-aggressive philosophy of House Jerbiton. Few magi of other Houses bothered with the area, content to explore their native soils in Western Mythic Europe. At the founding of the Order of Hermes, the Byzantine Empire extended into Hungary and Bulgaria, and deep into Asia Minor. This vast area contained wizards from many disparate traditions, who were all members of the Eastern Empire and showed little desire to join the nascent Order. Distrustful of Westerners in general and Latins in particular, they saw little need to replace their freedom''
''under the typikon of Prokopios with the restriction of the Oath of Hermes. In 775, House Tremere invaded Greece, slaying wizards and taking vis and magical items as spoils. None of the wizards slain were members of the Order, meaning that the participating Tremere magi did not break their Hermetic Oaths. The response, however, was swift. Wizards suddenly found the need to defend their territory, and formed the Theban League to repel the invaders. Followers of Jerbiton and Trianoma renewed the invitation to join the Order, and many''
''accepted in order to receive legal immunity from these attacks. This act, more so than the military reprisals, ended the conflict. Tremere magi who were ready to slay outsiders balked at attacking members of the Order. One hundred years later, House Tremere again threatened the Tribunal and the entire Order. Always watchful, Theban magi successful intercepted messages indicating Tremere’s grand plan to become the Order’s overlord (see Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, page 113 for more details). His most trusted lieutenants and advisors were due to meet at''
''Dorostolon, a Tremere covenant in southern Bulgaria. A secret force of magi clandestinely entered the covenant and broke the minds and loyalties of Tremere’s lieutenants. Although no one officially claimed responsibility for the Sundering (as this event it is known), the most commonly held local opinion is that the magical bindings holding Typhon (see Chapter 9, Magic: The Titans) were undone, and a pact forged with it. This group of magi — probably from the covenant of Hedyosmos, among others — directed the creature at Dorostolon. Once Typhon had removed the threat of Tremere’s ambition by destroying the covenant and incapacitating the magi, it was re-imprisoned. Tremere himself died shortly after. At the sixth Grand Tribunal in 865, the Theban Tribunal was officially instituted, and named after the Theban League that had formed in response to the depredations of House Tremere. The territory granted to the Tribunal stretched from the Ionian to the Black Sea, and extended into the lands of the Bulgars and into Anatolia. The fact that the Tribunal contained just one domus magna — Coeris, Tremere’s home — but was named after and centered on the lands of the Theban League was testament to the distrust that the Order held for House Tremere at that time. The formation of the Bulgarian Empire thirty years later, along with the gradual recovery of House Tremere from its self-imposed isolation and subsequent expansion, convinced the ninth Grand Tribunal in 964 that the Theban Tribunal was too unwieldy in its current form, and the Transylvanian Tribunal was formed from its northern reaches. The Theban Tribunal’s boundaries have remained constant since then. The Tribunal of Thebes played almost no part in the Schism War, although some Greek magi enlisted in the cause and fought battles in Western Mythic Europe. As the war tailed off, a Byzantine army invaded Bulgaria in 1014. House Tremere insists that Theban magi assisted the emperor. This claim hasn’t been proven, but it is true that certain magi, especially Gentle Gifted Jerbitons, had close connections with the emperor and other powerful families of the Byzantine Empire. House Tremere’s response came in 1185, when the House supported the lords behind a Bulgarian rebellion. Military aid was withheld, but materials and advice were supplied. This led to a few Greek magi announcing their support for the emperor, and forming the League of Advisors, who took up residence in Constantinople to openly participate in the emperor’s court. They did not benefit monetarily''
''from this association and claimed they only offered advice, mindfully treading the line between the permitted role of advisor and forbidden post of court wizard. In the midst of this affair was the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, and the loss of the Anatolian plateau to the Seljuk Turks. Byzantine magi occupying the area fled Asia Minor following the invasion of the sultan, and have not returned to the region since.''

===The Collapse of an Empire===

''Many Theban magi avoided the entire imbroglio of the League of Advisors, concentrating on their own interests and participating in the Tribunal’s culture and political responsibilities. Some paid no attention at all, until 1204 when Constantinople fell to the Italian and French forces of the Fourth Crusade. Once boasting three covenants, the fall of the mighty City of the East saw the end of them all. Thermakopolis was destroyed utterly, and its only survivor, Mathieus, is in self-imposed exile (see The Lion and the Lily, page 87). Moero’s Garden, a covenant more concerned with poetics than politics, relocated to Nicaea, following the exodus of many Greek nobles. Xylinites became more insular and closed its walls to outsiders. In the aftermath, accusations flew as rapidly as arrows. House Tremere was blamed, as was House Jerbiton. The League of Advisors, which had lost many of its members with the fall of Thermakopolis, couldn’t weather allegations of interference with mundanes, and disbanded. Although the Theban Tribunal failed to secure a conviction against members of the former league, House Tremere has appealed to the Grand Tribunal of 1228 for the case against the two surviving magi to be reconsidered. Should this appeal be successful, it could have important consequences for the autonomy of Tribunals in general and the Theban polity in particular. The reorganizing of the Byzantine Empire into smaller empires has forced some covenants to adapt to the changing political landscape that results from new rulers, but others have been left untouched. Every Theban magus has an opinion on the current situation, but not all are willing to commit to the various leagues that have formed as a response (see The Leagues of Thebes, later). Not all believe that the situation threatens the supernatural balance that existed, but the majority does. It has been just 16 years since the fall of Constantinople, and while Frankish magi have followed the mundanes east''
''wards, they have not settled in sufficiently large numbers to have a noticeable impact on the Tribunal’s practices. However, some have already rebelled against the Theban polity, and the Tribunal of 1221 promises to be an interesting one as they seek to make changes to their adopted home.''
''The Leagues of Thebes''
''Theban magi have a propensity to form leagues: alliances of like-minded individuals devoted to pursuing a specific goal. There are several leagues currently active in the Tribunal; each league has only a few members and none is powerful enough to accomplish its goals quickly or privately. Each will need more members or cooperation from other sources. The overall goal of each is altruistic: to continue the prosperity and hegemony of the Theban Order of Hermes. Each league, however, has a different idea how this should be done. Some of the leagues presented below might have goals that could be construed as contrary to the Code of Hermes. However, actions are prohibited by the Code, not ideology, so none of these leagues contravene the Code merely by existing. On the other hand, the actions of magi pursuing the goals of their league may well provoke other magi to prosecute them for a crime. The following are just examples of some of the leagues currently active in Thebes.''
''The League of Constantine''
''Constantine was the Roman emperor who founded Constantinople, dividing the Roman Empire into Eastern and Western halves, revitalizing the empire, and pouring new energy into the faltering state. While the West was lost to barbarians, the East still maintains its imperial traditions and nature. Constantinople has been conquered several times over the centuries, but in the past, the conqueror would marry into one of the noble imperial families and continue the Roman tradition. The Latins have not done this. To make matters worse, they have subjugated the Church to the pope’s authority, something''
''no conqueror has done before. The League of Constantine hopes to return the empire to its true path, put a legitimate Greek emperor back on the throne, and return the empire to the hands of God. The league is composed entirely of Jerbiton magi, although that is not a requirement for membership. Each has an apprentice who is nearing gauntleting age, a member of the antigones (Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 43). The apprentices are more martial than their parentes, and this league promises to be more effective than Jerbiton magi in the past. The league is currently centered at Moero’s Garden, the covenant near''
''Nicaea. For more information on this league, see Chapter 11.''
''The Children of Olympos''
''A small and eccentric league of magi who have dubbed themselves The Children of Olympos believe that the Tribunal would be better served if the magical patrons of each covenant were the Greek gods of old, rather than the sundry assortment currently occupying those positions. Centered around''
''the charismatic Lucian the Scholar of House Merinita (see Chapter 4: Theban Covenants, Aegaea), the league declares that the Order should step away from the ebbing fortunes of the Divine and Infernal by adhering to a more permanent and ancient supernatural foundation. Magical creatures are too temperamental, and uninterested in mortal affairs. Faeries, however, are intrinsically interested in the fates of men. The Greek gods have outlasted all others, Lucian claims, with Christ’s reign casting a shadow over their long involvement with the hearts of men. See Chapter 10 for more information on this league.''

''Former Covenants of the Theban Tribunal''

===Dorostolon (815 –848)===

''A covenant on the south bank of the Danube, and temporary home to several powerful Tremere magi who were orchestrating their Founder’s plan to dominate the Order. The fortress was ripped apart, allegedly by Typhon in its efforts to get to Tremere’s lieutenants during the Sundering of that house.''

===Estropi (914 – 1069)===

''A sept of Bjornaer magi all with heartbeasts of predatory birds. They lived on Mount Erciyes, the highest mountain in central Anatolia, and fled after the invasion of the Seljuk Turks.''

===Grammaton (980 – 1092):===

''Grammaton of Bonisagus and his filii were devoted to the completion of original research connected to binding magics. The covenant, named after its founder, was disbanded over a hundred years later when it became apparent that the research was not going to achieve its goal, despite several interesting innovations and discoveries. The remaining magi joined other covenants.''

===Diadelphia (1004 – 1067)===

''Founded by the two brothers, Cosmas and Baztas of House Verditius, on the island of Kalymnos. Other Verditius magi joined,''
''but left due to the bitter rivalry between the brothers. Cosmas was ostracized in 1067, and surprisingly his brother left the Thebes Tribunal with him. With no other magi living at the covenant, it was disbanded by default.''

===Kyddopetre (1039 – 1076)===

''Founded by a collection of Flambeau magi at the Cilician Gates, a narrow pass south of the Tarsus mountains that lead to southern Anatolia. After the Battle of Manzikert, in which the emperor was soundly defeated by the Seljuk Turks, the Byzantine Empire lost Cilicia to the Sultanate of Rum. Living outside the Byzantine empire was not a legal problem, but the magi disbanded, feeling too isolated from their Greek fellows to remain.''

===The Court of Fools (1101 – 1204)===

''An itinerant Ex Miscellanea covenant full of mystics and soothsayers, which toured throughout mainland Greece. It was in Constantinople at the time of that city’s destruction, and was destroyed in the fires. Several of its magi have resurfaced in 1220.''

===Thermakopolis (1115 – 1204)===

''The pride and shame of House Jerbiton, pledged to the protection of Constantinople, a task in which it ultimately failed.''

===Lamites (1123 – 1127)===

''A short-lived Anatolian covenant devoted to prophecy, and claiming the Phrygian Sibyl (see Chapter 9) as their patron. It is believed that Lamia killed them all for their presumption, although it may have been the faerie called Lamia (Realms of Power: Faerie, page 68) who objected to the competition.''

===Thumachia (1151 – 1185)===

''Founded to protect the Tribunal’s western border after ravages from the Second Crusade. The primarily Jerbiton magi trod a fine line between intervention in mortal affairs and protecting their sodales. Thumachia was sacked during the war between the Sicilian Normans and the Byzantine Empire. Instead of reforming Thumachia, the surviving magi joined Thermakopolis.''

===Novocastrum (1207-1212)===

''A short-lived covenant of Frankish magi in the western borders of the Kingdom of Thessaloniki, land which has since been conquered by the Principality of Epiros. It had little time to prepare for the Greek attack, and was destroyed when its magi unsuccessfully resisted; few in the Tribunal mourned their loss.''

|]
''The Sundered Eagle The League of the Vigilant''
''The League of the Vigilant was formed very recently. Most magi know that Infernal forces were active in both the Latin and Byzantine armies when the city of Constantinople fell, and many suspect that the Order may also be infected. Hydatius of Ingasia and Proximios of Alexandria have banded together to form this league, the former to act as its general and the later to provide funding and magical supplies (see Chapter 8: Anatolia, The Covenant of Alexandria for more on Proximios). The league is just forming and its membership is small. It has no formal home or central meeting place at this point; Hydatius and Proximios are just beginning to recruit members. Hydatius and Proximios want magi who are not native to the Tribunal, hoping that fresh blood can hunt out bad. They plan to keep the identity of the other members of this league secret so as to best search out corruption, while the two of them seek cooperation and assistance publicly. Demon hunting is dangerous, demon detecting nearly impossible. The league knows that Hermetic magic can not detect demons, but hopes that careful investigation will. They watch their brethren patiently, waiting for a tainted member to accidentally reveal his true nature. The Tribunal of Thebes accepts this league, as they do any, but wonders at its effectiveness. Persecutions have a history of growing out of control, and the more reserved magi of the Tribunal are wary. Others think this is a necessary step to ensure that the Order isn’t corrupted like the ruling factions of the mundanes were. Hydatius and Proximios’ glowing reputations give the League of the Vigilant an air of respectability, making naysayers reluctant to criticize it.''
''League Against Idolatry''
''This league consists of those magi who strongly oppose the remnants of pagan practice in the Order’s traditions, and work actively to remove them, principally through the workings of the Legislative Board (see later). Their main focus at the moment is the Ceremony of Propitiation, which they consider to be idolatrous. This small league consists in 1220 of the magi of Oikos tou Eleous and Gigas, with sporadic half-hearted support from Artoud of Xylinites. The league actively opposes the Tribunal’s recognition of patrons, and in particular the maintenance of the altars and vis sacrifices practiced at Delos in Tribunal years. These practices are seen by the covenants mentioned as clearly pagan ­— and going beyond veneration and the respect due to an entity, which is proskynesis timetike directed to the subject, and crossing the line to worship (latreia). The league is highly controversial, and the outbursts and anger that the issue raises have yet to be resolved. The tradition of the Tribunal is ancient, but the league claims that these practices constitute a mortal sin, and bring the anger of God upon the magi who participate, and upon their sodales.''
''Theban Tribunal Politics''
''When the Order of Hermes formed, a typikon offered by a Jerbiton magus of Prokopios’ line was influential in constructing the Order’s system of governance. As a result, the Order developed into a democratic organiza''
''tion largely unknown to eighth century Europeans. However, the Theban League did not feel that the Order went far enough in its principles of fairness and democracy, and when the Theban Tribunal was formed in 865 they swiftly executed rulings of the Peripheral Code that moved the governance of the Tribunal closer to that used by the original typikon of Prokopios rather than the diluted version practiced in the rest of the Order. The members of the Theban Tribunal are very proud of their political system. They consider the weakened governance practiced by the rest of the Order to be inherently corruptible, requiring men and women of great character to prevent that corruption from affecting the members of the Order themselves. In the Theban polity, all decisions are delegated to the Hermetic Assembly; that is, the magi of the Tribunal. However, the business of the Assembly is initiated, prepared, and implemented through magistrates who are selected by lot — the magistrates themselves are excluded from the actual decision-making procedure. Theban magi believe that their system removes block voting and factionalism (since magistrates are chosen at random), prevents cronyism (since the figures in power cannot serve for more than seven years at a time), and negates corruption (since magistrates have no executive or political power). Furthermore, the system encourages a sense of responsibility and altruism by rewarding acts that strengthen the Tribunal, and punishing antisocial acts.''
''The Hermetic Polity''
''The cornerstones of the polity of the Theban Tribunal are twofold. The citizens of the polity have all the executive power, whereas the Council of Magistrates has all the administrative power. Take, for instance, the most common example of an alleged violation of the Code of Hermes: in Thebes it is the magistrates who prepare the evidence for the prosecution and the defense, not the principles involved. The decision of guilt or innocence is determined by the citizens (which is true for both Thebes and the usual Hermetic system), but deciding the punishment to be levied against a guilty party — which would normally be the job of the Quaesitores — is again the prov''

''The Origins of the Polity''
''The Athenian political system has long been held up as an ideal government. Modeled on political theories of Plato, Aristotle, and Polybios (to name but a few), it reached its height in the days of Demosthenes (384–322 BC). It was lauded for its fairness, in that the laws were both determined by and protective of the people rather than the rulers. Technically not a democracy but a polity (politeia), a key feature was that individuals could not amass political power: they were not elected into''
''positions of authority, but rather chosen at random; they served for no more than one year at a time; and they could never serve in the same capacity more than once. Furthermore, those who served in an authoritative position had no executive power; all decisions were made by the Assembly as a collective rather than by any individual. Despite its noble beginnings, through successive reforms the governance of Athens became corrupted from its philosophical ideal, and eventually vanished.''

|]
''ince of the polity. House Guernicus remains the expert in the study of Hermetic law, but has little role in the execution of it. This is quite deliberate; by putting the interpretation of the Code into the hands of amateurs, the Tribunal ensures that its rulings are intelligible to the average member of the Tribunal rather than being the arcane minefield common in so many other Tribunals. Technicalities of the law and legal loopholes are far less common in the Theban Tribunal. The Tribunal’s procedures are mediated through the election of archai (singular “arche”), a council of 16 magistrates who manage the Tribunal’s resources, review the law, and investigate cases. Archai are selected at each Tribunal meeting, and serve for seven years at a time. They elect one of their number to be the archon, who acts as chairman to the council. There are two other executive positions: the logothete who marshals the Tribunal’s bureaucracy, and the polemarch who ensures its edicts are carried out.''
''Citizenship''
''The magi of the Theban Tribunal are its citizens. All citizens are equal; anyone trying to claim superiority over a member of the Tribunal based on lineage, reputation, age, or raw power is violating local etiquette. Theban magi do not acknowledge titles such as Archmage, Chief Quaesitor, Primus, and so forth, although they do respect job titles such as Quaesitor, Redcap, and hoplite. Not every magus in Theban territory is a citizen, however. The Tribunal recognizes two categories of individual: politai and metoikoi. A polites (pol-LEE-tees, “citizen”) is a member of the Order of Hermes who passed his Apprentice’s Gauntlet in the Theban Tribunal, and who remains in good standing with the Tribunal by maintaining his civic duty. This civic duty is measured by the possession of tokens that are awarded for certain acts. Only politai are entitled to become magistrates. A metoikos (MEH-tee-kos, “resident foreigner”) is a member of the Order of Hermes who is not a member of the Theban Tribunal. They are either guests to the Tribunal, or politai who have lost their rights due to failing in their civic duties. A foreign magus can become a polites through a citizenship decree of the Tribunal (see Tribunal Procedure). This caste exists to keep those who have not contributed to the well being of the''
''polity from benefiting from it. The Tribunal of Thebes does not tolerate parasites easily.''

===The Phylai===

''To ensure equal representation of citizens in the administration of the Theban Tribunal, all its politai are divided into four phylai (feel-EH, “tribes”, singular phyle), and each phyle is represented four archai. Phylai are determined purely by the covenant in which a magus maintains his sanctum, and one’s phyle is meaningless outside of the political context. A phyle never functions as a political party, and there is no precedence or hierarchy among the phylai. The four phylai are:''
''The Ionian Phyle: Covenants on the western mainland of the Tribunal contribute to the Ionian phyle. Thessaly, Epiros, and the Peloponnese are counted among its territories, which currently include the covenants of Erebos, Epidauros, and Hedyosmos. The Aegean Phyle: The lands around the Aegean Sea all under the Aegean phyle. Boeotia, Euboea, and Macedonia are within its territories, as well as the northern islands. The covenants of Aegaea, Oikos tou Eleous, and Ingasia contribute members to the Aegean phyle. The Kretan Phyle: Candia, the Cyclades, and the Dodecanese are the principle territories of the Kretan phyle, along with southern Nicaea. This includes the covenants of Alexandria, Favonius, and Polyaigos. The Propontian Phyle: Covenants to the''
''east of the Tribunal, in Thrace, northern Nicaea, Constantinople, and any covenants in the Black Sea, are members of the Propontian phyle. This currently includes Moero’s Garden, Gigas, Xylinites, and Michael’s Tabula.''
''The Council of Magistrates''
''The role of arche (arkh-EE, “magistrate”) is a duty rather than an honor; it confers no additional political rights but greater responsibility. Archai assist in organization and administration on behalf of the Tribunal’s citizens for seven years. There are 16 archai, four drawn from each of the four phylai; and the Council of Magistrates also has two executive members — the polemarch and the logothete — and is lead by the archon, who is chosen from among the archai. The archai constitute three boards and the treasury council according to the capacity in which they serve the Tribunal. No citizen can serve two consecutive terms as arche, but apart from this restriction, any citizen can serve as a magistrate regardless of age or experience. The Council of Magistrates meets as a whole once at the Tribunal meeting that formed it, and once more midway through the inter-Tribunal period. This mid-term meeting is held at the archon’s covenant, or an alternative venue of his choosing. At this meeting, matters of jurisdiction are discussed, and archai can request advice or assistance from the Council. If a case re''

''Theban Quaesitores''
''In the Tribunal of Thebes the polity (in the form of a board of magistrates, see later) conducts investigations into potential breaches of the Code of Hermes, rather than the Quaesitores. Furthermore, another faculty traditionally devolved to House Guernicus — the review, updating, and expansion of the Peripheral Code — is also performed by the polity. Rather than emasculating the House, Theban magi (Guernici included) argue that this permits them to be more than simply investigators and judges, and removes an onerous and sometimes time-consuming duty from their backs. Thanks to their training, members of House Guernicus remain the experts in''
''Hermetic Law, and are often used as expert witnesses or sources of information, which enhances rather than diminishes their prestige in the Order. As a consequence of this shared responsibility of Quaesitorial duties, members of House Guernicus tend to be as variable as other houses in their magical interests and studies, rather than concentrating on investigatory magic. Furthermore, they feel less obligation to remain neutral parties than in other Tribunals, and partake in voting readily. It is a matter of personal choice as to whether a Theban Quaesitor uses his vote when attending meetings of other Tribunals, such as the Grand Tribunal.''
