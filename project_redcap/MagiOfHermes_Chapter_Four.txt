''Concept: A master at magically enhancing plants, his greatest creation may be the living tree that serves as his home.''
''Gwidion Griffith of Veriditius stands a towering four foot nothing, with thick curly brown hair, brown crows-footed eyes, and a lean frame. Gwidion has one more feature that truly sets him apart from other magi, he’s tan. With skin weathered and wrinkled from a life lived with his hands in the dirt and his face in the sun, Gwidion commonly dresses as a farmer. Wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, plain tunic and breeches, and simple sandals on his feet, Gwidion could almost be mistaken for a common peasant. However, the tall rune-engraved staff and large overthe-shoulder satchel betray Gwidion’s status as a magus. Gwidion can usually be found with dirt and sap on his hands and knees, a long blade of grass in his mouth, and a smile upon his face. Gwidion was once considered one of the bright rising stars within his guild and house, but a violent disagreement with his master at Tribunal led him to earn the enmity of his guild when he voted against them on vis harvesting rights. Only a few years out of gauntlet, Gwidion left Durenmar in disgust and took to wandering in the deep woods and Welsh farmlands of his youth.''

''The World Tree''
''The Tree of Life has its roots in every religion and culture throughout the world. Often a symbol of immortality and fertility in Norse mythology, the taproots of this tree are thought to stretch deep down into underworld. Its branches reach high into the heavens, connecting the worlds together. To Jews and Christians the world tree is the tree from the Garden of Eden, from whose fruits eternal life might''
''be gained. Gwidion became particularly obsessed with the legend of the world tree after defending some villagers from bandits. He entered Twilight and while there he had a vision of the mighty World Tree. After returning to the real world, he stopped his wanderings and settled into a relatively uninhabited wood to study, to build, and to comprehend the depths of his vision. He has not left the forest since.''

''Activities in the last eleven years: Gwidion adopted a sapling from the forest fire years back and made it his talisman. Enchanting it with movement, it now carries him from place to place and is his constant companion in these, the twilight years of his life. Knowing that death or Final Twilight await, Gwidion spent much of this time seeing that the covenant is enchanted with every form of comfort, that his forest is given adequate protection from fire and drought, and that his hives of bees is set up just so. He has plans to permanently awaken Edward (his pet name for his riding tree), and enchant into the large oak powers to awaken other trees to life and movement, call rainstorms, and protect his forest and friends from harm from until Disenchantment brings the great oak down. However, that will only happen if he manages to last another fifteen years. During this period, Gwidion earned 126 experience points in Arts and spent 16 seasons in the lab enchanting items in an effort to prepare his covenant for the day he will no longer be there.''
''New Spells''
''Gwidion has devised the following new spells.''
''Animal Spells''

===Voice of the King===

''ReAn 40 R: Voice, D: Diameter, T: Group This spell works much as Commanding the Harnessed Beast (ArM5, page 120), with the exception that it is designed exclusively to work on whole swarms of bees (a swarm of bees weighs less than a pig, so no size adjustment is necessary). Bees are fairly intelligent as insects go, but they’re still just insects, so vague or overly complex commands are not likely to be very effective. The bees will probably still attempt the task even if they don’t understand it. Note that usurping the king bee’s authority can anger the hive once the spell wears off. (Base 15, +2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +1 Group)''
''Herbam Spells''

===Circle of Eternal Spring===

''CrHe 4 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle This spell ensures that all plants within the circle grow well. It has the same effect as The Bountiful Feast (ArM5, page 135), but is based on Ring Duration and Circle Target. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''

===Ladder of Ivy===

''CrHe 15 R: Voice, D:Sun, T:Individual This spell creates a sturdy ladder of ivy that the magus or others can use to scale any wall or (low) cliff. The ivy withers at sunrise or sunset, and can reach up about twenty paces. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)''

===Fast Grow===

''CrHe 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual This spell brings a plant to full maturity in a single day or night. Note that the spell must be cast soon after sunrise or sunset for the duration to be long enough for its effect. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Fortress of Oak===

''Cr(Mu)He(Te) 40 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Individual, Ritual This ritual is normally cast on an acorn from an oak tree and it works like the spell Conjuring the Mystic Tower (ArM5, page 153) with the exception that it utilizes a tree rather than stone. The tree springs from the ground in moments, towering to its full height of around eighty feet. The tree is still alive, but it has chambers within, complete with earthen floors and earthen hearths for fires. The magus decides the shape and design of the chambers when casting the spell. If the tree dies, the tower remains, now being a dead tree. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +3 Size, +3 Elaborate, +1 Terram Requisite, +1 Muto Requisite)''

===Gigantic Growth===

''MuHe 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual This spell instantly increases the size of any plant by a factor of 100, turning bushes into barriers and saplings into mighty oaks. The plants instantly return to normal size at the end of the spell’s duration. Larger plants only grow to 100 times the size of a base Individual, but they can be affected. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Unnatural, +2 Size)''

===Razor Thorns===

''MuHe(Te) 25 R: Voice, D: Diameter, T: Group This spell causes razor-sharp thorns to spring out of every plant or plant-made product in an area within the range of the caster’s voice. These thorns deal +10 damage to up to a standard group of people (up to ten). The thorns eventually retreat, but they remain for roughly two minutes and can still act as a viable deterrent as the thorns are still just as sharp as a knife. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 Group)''

===Blades of Grass, Leaves of Cutting===

''MuHe 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group This spell makes all the grass and leaves of a group of plants as sharp as a sword’s blade; this can make an area utterly impassable for even the most armored of individuals. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group)''

===Awaken Consciousness of Plant===

''MuHe(Me) 55 R: Voice, D: Year, T: Group, Ritual This spell works exactly as the spell, Stir the Slumbering Tree (ArM5, page 137), only it is used to awaken multiple plants at once rather than one or two at a time. Once raised, the plants have a state of consciousness that resembles that of a human. The plants can see and hear what’s going on around them and at a normal human level of perception. Such plants tend to share some mental attributes or personality traits with the caster. The plants can rearrange their leaves, stems, or branches over the course of several hours, though too slowly for people to observe the movement from second to second. The size bonus enables the spell to awaken an entire forest grove in one go. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +4 Year, +2 Group, +2 Size)''

===Prune Plant===

''Pe(Re)He 20 R: Voice, D: Momentary, T: Individual The magus can instantly trim various parts of a plant into any shape that he wishes. The magi must specify the shape of the plant when he casts the spell. The magus cannot increase the size of the plant, nor kill a plant by over-pruning it with this spell, but he can remove or rearrange the branches and leaves in any way that he likes, just as if he where pruning it normally. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 size, +1 Rego Requisite)''

===Wilt===

''PeHe 35 R: Voice, D: Momentary, T: Part This spell causes a plant to wilt and die instantly, though it does not affect any en''
''chantments or spells currently on the plant. Larger plants are still affected, but only parts of them at a time when the spell is cast. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +3 size)''

===Ring of Ever Bloom===

''ReHe 15 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle This spell forces the plant or flower to continue to bloom even out of season. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''

===Controlled Growth===

''ReHe 25 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Individual, Ritual Using this spell, the magus can shape the growth of a plant over the course of the next year, as if he were properly pruning it, caring for it, and so on. The eventual shape of the plant is determined when the spell is cast and it can be as simple or as complex as the magus desires, although truly complicated designs, such as making a bush grow in the shape of someone’s face, may require a Finesse check. Once the plant reaches the shape and dimensions that the magus wishes, it stops growing until the spell ends or a new spell is cast upon it. Once the spell ends, the plant will then grow normally, but it still retains its magically ‘pruned’ shape, until it grows naturally out of it. Fast grow spells, or other methods used to accelerate the growth of plants, will still work, but until this spell ends the plant will not grow past the design limits originally set. This spell does not change the essential nature of the plant nor give it anything that an exceptionally good gardener couldn’t. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +4 Year)''

===Tree Top Walk===

''ReHe 25 R: Voice, D: Concentration, T: Group This spell moves the branches of nearby trees so that the magus can literally walk from one tree to the next without ever touching the ground. The trees do not uproot themselves, but they do bend in unnatural ways to help the magus reach them and walk unhindered from branch to branch. Of course, the trees’ branches still need to be strong enough to support the magus’ weight. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 Group)''

===Prison Floral===

''ReHe 30 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle In an effort to protect his grogs, Gwidion developed this spell after discovering that many of his enchanted plants were starting to Warp under his magical effects. A circle is drawn around many of the aggressively Warped plants to help contain them and protect others from their more-bizarre effects. The spell imprisons the plant within the circle. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''

===Command of the Forest===

''ReHe(Me) 55 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group, Ritual The magus can make a whole wood of plants (up to 10,000 individuals in mass) move with purpose and intelligence to obey the magus’ commands, even if those commands are to uproot and run directly into a bonfire or to hit someone with its branches. The plants continue to obey the command until either the task is complete or the spell expires. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +3 size)''
''Ignem Spells''

===Warmth of the Wood===

''CrIg 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part This spell heats the bark of a tree, the wood of a cart, or even the planks of a house so that it is warm to the touch. This a good effect to help dispel the chill of the night and keep the magus warm without having to build a fire. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

===Frosted Timber===

''PeIg 20 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part This spell cools the bark of a tree, the wood of a cart, or even the planks of a house so that it is cool to the touch. This a good effect to help dispel the heat of the night and keep the magus cool during the hotter seasons. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''
''Imaginem Spells''

===Sight of the Blossom, Ears of the Oak===

''InIm 30 R: Arcane Connection, D: Sun, T: Group While using this spell, the magus can see and hear what’s happening in a distant place if he possesses some sort of Arcane Connection to either the location or the person he’s scrying upon. Gwidion normally uses leaves or flower buds from trees and bushes all around his forest to help keep an eye on what’s going on when he’s not there. (Base 2, +4 Arcane Connection, +2 Sun, +2 Group)''
''Terram Spells''

===Tilled Soil===

''ReTe 15 R: Voice, D: Momentary, T: Part This spell instantly tills an amount of soil equal to that of 1000 cubic paces, making it perfect for planting crops or just soft enough to lie down upon comfortably. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +2 Size)''

===Mold the Earth Within Sight===

''ReTe 30 R: Sight, D: Momentary, T: Part Using this spell, the magus can shape an amount of earth equal to the mass of a hundred men into any form that he likes, although truly complicated forms may require a Finesse check. This spell was originally invented to help build quick walls or boundaries (even hasty circles), but its applications could be broader. This spell only works on dirt, rock, and stone; other more-exotic forms of Terram (metal, diamonds, gemstones, etc.) are unaffected. (Base 2, +3 Sight, +1 Part, +1 Size, +1 Elaborate, +2 stone)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Gwidion created the following items.''

''Stone Disk of Warmth of Wood''
''These disks were enchanted so as to keep the entire covenant warm during the cooler months of the year. During the hotter months, the disks are kept inside a steel box just outside the covenant to prevent their effects from unbalancing the covenant’s winter enchantments.

''Ring of Mixed Compost''
''Waste removal in the covenant involves a combination of three enchantments. The first was to design the covenant so that every bed chamber had its own private privy, with a long shaft that leads down into a room on the ground floor. The shafts are''
''kept clean by the water vines; every time a grog or magus uses his privy, he just activates the vines and water rushes down the shaft, carrying the waste with it to the bottom chamber. The liquid is then reabsorbed into the earth and tree, while the''
''rest of the waste is dealt with by a large enchanted stone circle that surrounds the walls of the room where the waste is disposed of. The enchanted ring has a constant effect upon it, which lets it continue to mix the dirt, waste, and plant matter over and over again throughout the night.

''Rings of Basketed Transport''
''There are four rings in the forest used to transport people and supplies. The enchantments actually affect larger-than-life baskets, big enough and strong enough to hold up to thirty people comfortably. When the rings move a basket, they take the people, animals, and whatever else is inside the basket along. The first one is right at the base of the covenant and it transports people and things up to one of the balconies. The second is on an adjacent balcony and it is used to transport people and things back down to the ground. This (outside of climbing) is the only way in or out of the covenant. The second set of rings is located at two different places, one near the covenant tree (but not right next to it) and the other located outside the large Iron Blackberry bush. Both of these rings are elevated atop a large circular stone pedestal that is conveniently higher then the blackberry bush. The pedestals both have ramps built into them to allow for carts to be pulled upward to the baskets for loading and unloading of supplies, and staircases are installed on the opposite side for foot traffic. One ring is designed to transport people out of the covenant’s private forest, and the other transports people back in. These two rings require two separate mental commands, while the rings at the covenant tree only require that person to think “up” or “down.” The baskets were woven by Gwidion himself using magic.

''Enchanting Giant Plants''
''A magus cannot enchant something that does not fit in his laboratory. Gwidion can get around this with his plants by enchanting them while they are young and small, and then using magic to make them much larger once the enchantment is complete. In many cases, the magic to make the plants large is part of the enchantment. In others, it is allowed for in the initial enchantment, so that it does not count as damage to the item.''

''Magi of Hermes Talisman: Gwidion’s Riding Tree''
''In his old age, Gwidion found it more and more difficult to go outside the covenant and harvest vis, so he created his Talisman. Gwidion’s Talisman is a (now) fully grown oak, but due to its various enchantments it has become severely Warped over the years, so that its branches resemble hands, its roots feet, and upon its trunk is a great gnarled face whose expression seems to change with the seasons and the moods of its creator. In his advanced years, Gwidion uses the tree to move around his forest and visit the covenant’s farms and bee hives to make sure all is going well. Gwidion has even thought about expanding his tree’s size and then simply building his lab right atop it, but as yet he has not gone that far with the great oak. Vis spent to open: 10 (more vis added later, as a talisman)''
