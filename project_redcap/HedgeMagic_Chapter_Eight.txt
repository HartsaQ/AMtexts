===a Note On Nightwalker Sources and Approaches===

''Nightwalkers are recorded in detail in Classical Greek works, and in works that post-date the game period. During the game period, they are mentioned in several sources, but are described with insufficient detail to develop material that presents complete, genuine regional variants. Troupes are encouraged to jumble together the elements of the various nightwalking groups presented here, to create a unique group suitable for the region in which their covenant lies. The groups described here were usually not described in detail during the 13th Century, but have been included to allow players to choose elements to incorporate into fictional traditions that they design themselves.''
