''Concept: Spinning webs of intrigue through the use of secret Mysteries, this crafter of seemingly humble devices is as secretive, manipulative, and vindictive as his arachnid familiar implies.''
''Petalichus the Weaver of Veriditus is the latest in the line of Arachne’s Children, a diminished cult of weavers within House Verditius. He learned to weave magic into the most humble of devices, while others in his House wrought great weapons and exquisite rings. But beyond his House, his learning in philosophy and the artes liberales brought him to the attention of others, and he was soon adopted into the Cononites, a secretive mystical cult within the Order of Hermes that seeks out, reveres, and safeguards the more esoteric works of Conon of Samos and other Greek scholars such as Euclid, Apollonius, and Archimedes. The cult taught Petalichus its secret magic, and in return Petalichus crafted tools and devices to help its members use that learning more effectively. Petalichus the Weaver is as secretive, manipulative, and vindictive as his arachnid familiar leads others to suspect. Though his crafts may be humble, his ambitions are lofty and he often brings the full power of his knowledge and craft to bear on his enemies. He is a dangerous man, operating out of sight and through agents and proxies, concealed behind a web of deceit and confusion.''

Activities in the last 15 years: Over the course of the last 15 years, Petalichus began his journey through the Verditius mysteries taking his first initiation.

Activities in the last 15 years: During this period of Petalichus’ life, he was approached by the Cononites and initiated into its secret society. He gained their trust quickly. He has all but turned his back on his traditional Verditius Mysteries. It is worth noting that the Initiations Petalichus has endured up to this point have left him unable to work Spontaneous magic, as he now suffers from both the Weak and Difficult Spontaneous Magic flaws. He is reliant on a number of casting tablets supplied by his brother Cononites (see Covenants, page 89) for many simple spells. Assume that Petalichus has any reasonable Intellego spell up to fourth magnitude. He also began to experiment with creating ligatures (Art & Academe, page 68) at this time, another influence from the Cononites.''

''Activities in the last 15 years: Much of Petalichus’ time during this period was spent crafting his numerologist’s book, copies of which he supplied to the Cononites cult. His ambitious nature also asserted itself and he created a number of items with overtly offensive aims. As Petalichus approached his seventieth year, he finally bested his age-old enemy Solar Magnus while both were scouring Canterbury for an ancient text. His future is uncertain from this point onward, though his friends within the Cononites may exploit their connections and influence in his defense.''

===Unmake This Cloth===

''PeAn(He) 10 R:Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This spell unravels an item made of cloth, whether it be wool, linen, cotton, or silk. An Herbam casting requisite is required for for plant-based cloth. The garment, tapestry, or other item is disassembled carefully with all knots undone and stitching unpicked.''

Gold Cord: 2, Silver Cord: 1, Bronze Cord: 2 Bond Powers: Mental Communication, as per the level 15 effect in ArM5, page 105. This effect works on both Idmon and Petalichus. Shared Senses, as per the level 30 effect in ArM5, page 105. Only Idmon’s senses are shared with Petalichus. Appearance: Idmon is an unnaturally large, fragile-looking spider with long, angular legs jutting out from a smooth armored body. Idmon’s many eyes glitter and they reflect the bright patterns that cover its carapace.''
''Petalichus named his familiar Idmon after the father of Arachne, but if the spider has a true name it has not yet revealed it even to Petalichus. Idmon often travels with Petalichus, but is aware of his physical limitations so prefers to remain close to his master. However, on many occasions the magus sends his familiar out into the night to find and retrieve an Arcane Connection to a new target. Petalichus found his familiar somewhat late in life, when he was into his mid-fifties.''
''The item is reduced to discrete piles of thread. A Dexterity + Finesse simple roll determines how orderly these piles are arranged and sorted. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Herbam requisite)''

===Bind Fast===

''ReAn(He) 5 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group The targets’ clothes seek out and bind themselves to the nearest other object, moving or not. If the members of a group are standing sufficiently close, this spell binds them together. The magic lasts just long enough for the clothes to bind themselves into knots, and then dissipates allowing the targets to free themselves by undoing or cutting the knotted cloth. While all of a target’s surface clothing will writhe and seek out something to bind to, there is no guarantee that all of it can. If the clothes are close-fitting, or there is not enough slack in the garment, the cloth will simply flail for a moment and then fall dormant. If there is sufficient cloth but there is nothing within its reach, the target may still become bound up as his clothes wrap and tie themselves around his limbs. Affected targets suffer a –3 penalty to all subsequent rolls for physical actions, but can free themselves by either dedicating a round to cutting or tearing the clothing, or by spending two rounds working to untie the knots. Storyguides may wish to give other options to particularly large, strong, or dexterous characters. Until members of the target group have freed themselves, successive castings of this spell have no further effect. (Base 1, +2 Voice, +2 Group)''

===a Day’s Worth of Spinning===

''ReAn 10 R:Touch, D: Mom, T: Group One of the first spells taught to Petalichus by his mater, this spell cleans, cards, and spins a whole fleece, or a bale of cotton or flax, into thread in a matter of moments. If dye is available when the spell is cast, the thread can be dyed as the caster directs. A Herbam casting requisite is required for plant-based cloth. This is an Average task for a mundane spinner, so the caster must make a Perception + Finesse (precision) + stress die roll against''
''an Ease Factor of 12 (Craft Ease Factor 9 + 3 for using Craft Magic). Failing the roll results in a badly spun fleece, probably with flecks of dirt still clinging to the thread. A botched roll ruins the fleece outright, though this may not be immediately apparent. See Covenants, page 49 for more on Rego Craft Magic. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Group)''

===a Day’s Worth of Weaving===

''ReAn 10 R:Touch, D: Mom, T: Group This spell is exceptionally good at making simple cloth, but casters may find it difficult to create cloth of any great quality or highly patterned tapestries. The table below lists the base Ease Factors for weaving bolts of cloth in a single casting. Treat each bolt of cloth as being two paces in length by one pace wide. Successive castings can extend the current bolt of cloth rather than creating a new item. Members of Petalichus’ lineage have traditionally used this spell in practicing their Finesse. The caster makes a Perception + Finesse (precision) + stress die and compares the result against the table below.''
''Cloth Bolt’s Level Craft Magic Quality  Ease Factor Shoddy Trivial 6 Standard Simple 9 Superior Average 15 Excellent Hard 18''
''It is a harder task to create patterned cloth. A simple repeating pattern adds +3 to the Ease Factor, while an image or words woven into the cloth adds +6. See City & Guild, page 67 for more on item quality. A Herbam casting requisite is required for work involving cotton or linen. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Group)''

===The Even Hand of the Determined Weaver===

''Re(Cr)An 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part Like The Weaver’s Subtle Art (below), this spell makes a lasting change to a tapestry or other item made from cloth (whether made from wool, cotton, silk, or linen). Any geometric shape or regular line in or on the item, or even the shape of the item it''
''self, can be made even and precise. The Creo requisite ensures that the lines and shapes affected by this spell are perfect examples of their type. This spell is used to enhance items, especially when making Excellent-quality wares, or Items of Quality as per the Verditius House Mystery detailed in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 124. The application of this spell alone is not enough to raise the true quality of an item (it cannot be made more hardy or more richly colored, for instance), but it is enough to aid spells that require certain mathematical resonances. The individual changes made by the spell may stand out and draw the eye of those interested in the piece. Those looking at the work should make a Perception + Awareness + simple die roll against an Ease Factor of 9. On a success they notice the precision of the affected areas. Those who have the ability may substitute their Weaver craft ability for Awareness when making the check. A Herbam casting requisite is required for tapestries that include plant-based cloth or yarn. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 for size, +1 for Creo requisite)''

===The Treacherous Cloak===

''ReAn 5 R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind This spell uses a target’s clothes against him, twisting them into cords that then strangle the target for as long as the caster keeps concentrating. Using the deprivation rules in ArM5, page 180, the target must make a Stamina check every 5 rounds. Additionally, the target can attempt a Strength + Athletics stress roll against the caster’s Dexterity + Finesse Simple roll in order to break the grip of the clothes. If the character is being helped, use the highest Strength + Athletics score and add 1 for each other person helping. The target can attempt a Brave Personality Trait roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to perform an action other than attempting to free himself from the grip of his own clothes. The caster must, as usual, succeed in Concentration rolls each round. (base 1, +3 Sight, +1 Concentration)''

===The Weaver’s Subtle Art===

''ReAn 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part This spell allows the caster to make minor alterations to a finished tapestry or embroidered item, such as changing a subject’s pose, improving a likeness, or rewording an embroidered phrase. The change is minor in relation to the whole, never making up more than a fraction of the item, but as this spell can act on large tapestries, the individual change may itself be quite large. The change retains the original character of the work, so the intrinsic workmanship cannot, in itself, be improved through this spell. The version known to Petalichus was handed down through generations of his confraternity. Casters who know this version may use their Weaver craft ability in place of Finesse when determining the quality of the effect. Magi who invent this spell, or learn it from another source, use Finesse as normal. A Herbam casting requisite is required for tapestries using plant-based thread. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 for size, +1 for Finesse)''
''Corpus Spells''

===Arachne’s Tuition===

''ReCo 20 R:Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind Cast by a master on his apprentice, this spell allows the master to control the apprentice’s movements for a day. The caster can suspend the spell, allowing the apprentice to continue with a task or exercise, and then resume control in order to help the apprentice through a particularly complex task or to correct his student and show how something should be done. The apprentice learns at a much deeper level by having his own actions controlled from within, rather than simply being guided from without. This spell is designed to assist with the training of physical skills, notably craft skills. Each season a master uses this spell to instruct an apprentice, he can add 1 to his Training Source Quality (see ArM5, page 164). This version was developed generations ago within Petallichus’ line of Verditius weavers, though others certainly exist elsewhere within House Verditius and perhaps also in other Houses.''
''Two seasons of using this spell on an apprentice counts as one year of being under a constant magical effect as per ArM5, page 168, and inflicts 1 Warping point in that year. (Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun, +1 control over fine movements)''

===Remain Within Those Walls===

''ReCo 20 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Arcane Circle A variant on a warding theme, this spell cast with an Arcane Circle target both imprisons people within its bounds and prevents them from crossing into the Arcane Circle. The Arcane Circle target is usable by those who know the Hermetic Geometry Mystery, and allows the caster to draw a circle at his location while calculating and casting against a sympathetically identical circle in a remote location (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 95). Those with Resistance (through Parma or Might) are not confined or restricted unless this spell Penetrates that resistance. Arcane Connections to a named target may be used in order to increase the Penetration as normal, though the increased Penetration is only valid against that named target. As the base effect for warding spells is Touch, Ring, Circle, the Arcane Circle target raises the level of the spell by one magnitude as it is more complex than its mundane equivalent, but no modifier is required for either Touch or Ring. (base 15, +1 Arcane Circle)''
''Imaginem Spells''

===To See As Though a Plethron Distant===

''InIm 25 R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Special This spell allows the caster to see and hear his surroundings as though he was standing in another place he can naturally see. The spell does not enhance the caster’s natural sight or hearing. The caster has some freedom to move his vantage point, but cannot move into any place that he cannot naturally see from his physical location. Moving the viewpoint requires a Simple Stamina + Concentration Roll vs. Ease Factor 6.''
''The “plethron” of the spell title is a Greek measurement roughly equivalent to 100 feet, although the spell’s range allows for a potentially greater distance. Petalichus and his brother Cononites have investigated this spell, as Petalichus had anticipated that he would be able to use it to gain sight of new viable targets. This proved not to be the case. William Bonisagi theorized that the species, recreated as they are, bear insufficient connection to the things they represent to support casting spells against them. By being so far removed, the magus would essentially be attempting to cast his spells on mere apparitions. However, using this spell to aid with Hermetic Geometry spells (those using Arcane Line, Arcane Circle, and Arcane Ring) reduces the Distance Level by 1 if the caster can now see his target. This is cumulative with other spells or devices that may also reduce the Distance Level (see The Worldly Halysis later). The Target is based on Room, but is more complex as it allows unbounded spaces to be targeted. Any area comparable to Room can be targeted. (Base 2, +3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +3 Special target based on Room +1)''

===The Unwelcoming Room===

''CrMe 30 R: Line, D: Conc, T: Room Targeted on a distant room using the Arcane Line Range, this spell induces anger in all affected targets. A stress roll using an appropriate Personality Trait (like Calm or Restrained) against an Ease Factor of 9 is required to keep the anger under control. Aggressive traits (like Argumentative, Intolerant, or Angry) work against the roll. A failure inclines the target to aggressive action against anyone or anything that could appear or feel threatening. Petalichus knows the effect The Gift has on mundanes, and recognizes that the fear and distrust it fosters in them can easily be triggered into something more dangerous. Petalichus uses this spell to heighten tensions and use them against his enemies from a position of safety. (Base 4, +3 Line, +1 Concentration, +2 Room)''
''Magi of Hermes Vim Spells''

===a Day’s Grace===

''ReVi 30 R: Touch D: Hours T: Individual Using this spell, the caster is able to suppress one other spell he casts at the same time as this spell for a Duration counted in Celestial Hours (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 49). The suppressed spell can have a level up to 25 and may be Spontaneous, Ceremonial or Formulaic. Ritual spells are too complex to be suppressed by this spell although should a version of this spell be designed as a Ritual that should be possible. Spells with Circle and/or Ring Duration (including Arcane Circle and Arcane Ring) are also suppressed but fail if the circle inscribed during casting is broken before the spell is released (Arcane Circles and Rings are still visible to those with Second Sight, and may be broken by them before the spell is released). Sight-Ranged spells must be targeted''
''during the initial casting. Once the spell has been cast, the target will still be affected by it whether or not that target is still visible to the caster or not, though only where that target remains in the same location until the spell is triggered. (base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Hours equivalent of Sun)''
''Sample Rotes''
''Petalichus has invented the following effects as Rotes, the simple magical effects available to students of Hermetic Numerology. See The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 92 for details on casting.''

===Sense the Weight of Divine Power===

''InVi 3 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This rote (designed using the Hermetic Numerology Mystery Virtue) is a simple effect to tell the caster what strength of Divine aura he is currently standing in.''
''Petalichus has three other rotes that each perform the same effect for one of the other three Realms. (Base 2, +1 Touch)''

===Scribe the Perfect Circle===

''Re(Cr)Te 4 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind As the spell described in The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 96.''

===The Unseen Arm===

''ReTe 5 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind As the spell listed in ArM5, page 155.''

===Recollection of Memories Never Quite Lived===

''MuMe 4 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind As the spell listed in ArM5, page 149.''
''Enchanted Items''
''Petalichus created the following items.''
''Items of Quality''
''Many of the items Petalichus made for both his mundane and his Hermetic customers were Items of Quality (see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 124) that he was able to create after being initiated into the deeper Mysteries of his House. Those listed below are just a sample.''

===Battle Standard===

''This standard was crafted for a wealthy Byzantine noble and grants a +2 bonus to Leadership when used on the battlefield. Interestingly, while the standard has been designed for the specific noble, if the standard is ever captured in battle, the capturing side benefits from the Leadership bonus.''

===Cloth Shears===

''Petalichus brought the inherent quality of these fine steel shears out to assist him with his more mundane work. The shears grant a +2 bonus to rolls to create or mend clothing. But he took the process further and enchanted the shears with Rego Craft Magic (see below) and found that the quality also aided the spell. The shears grant the same bonus to Finesse rolls (when making or mending clothes) called for when using the enchantment (see below).''

===Cuirass of Steel===

''Despite its name, this cuirass is leather, not steel. Petalichus brought out the natural protective quality of armor to give this elegant embossed leather cuirass a +4 Soak bonus (the maximum Petalichus could achieve at that time). The armor retained its relative lightness while becoming as hard as steel. He granted the cuirass to his shield grog, Adrastos, in return for his long service and loyalty. This partial leather scale gives protection of 7 and a load of 3.''

===Loom===

''Petalichus has brought out his loom’s intrinsic quality to work cloth. As a loom has a very specialized use, it benefits from a +4 shape and material bonus to weave cloth (Petalichus could instead have brought out a +2 shape and material bonus with Imaginem). This bonus applies to all mundane weaving work done on the loom. He also spent a season investing the loom with the Day’s Worth of Weaving spell effect (see above) with two uses per day. The Finesse rolls required by this effect also benefit from the +4 bonus.''
''The Cloak of Authority''
''ReMe 24 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind Pen +0, 12/day This exquisite ceremonial cloak, embroidered with majestic and astrological iconography, was designed for a mundane noble who, in the way of Byzantine politics, was uncertain of the loyalty of those around him. The cloak is invested with The Aura of Rightful Authority (ArM5, page 151) with 12 uses per''
''day. The jeweled clasp at the cloak’s throat forms the focus for the Eye contact Range, and the device is activated through stroking this clasp. This cloak brought Petalichus to the attention of the Tribunal. His handiwork was recognized and charges of interfering with mundanes were brought against him for giving such a device to a man known to have lofty ambitions. Petalichus defeated the charge by producing his Lab Text for the device and proving that he had imbued no Penetration, thereby ensuring that the Divinely ordained natural order (Realms of Power: The Divine, page 42) could not be upset. (base5, +1 Eye, +2 Sun; +4 12/day)''
''Sanctum Door Hanging''
''This tapestry, which is large enough to hang in front of a sizable door, bears a stark white sanctum marker against a deep red background. From a distance it appears plain, though threaded through with various shades. A closer look reveals unnerving images of damnation and death that loom out of the tapestry. The purpose of the tapestry is to protect whatever room Petalichus happens to be using as a temporary sanctum. He often has cause to travel, and ensures that he takes this device with him to warn curious servants and innkeepers away from the secrets of wizards. The sanctum marker design is for the benefit of magi, as Petalichus doubts the Penetration built into the device’s effects will stop a committed magus of any worth.''

===Come No Further===

''CrMe 45 Pen +12, Constant Effect Expires: 70 Years R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Room This constant effect causes all those who pass in front of or approach the tapestry to feel distinctly uneasy in its presence. Those affected by the spell must succeed in a Brave (or other appropriate) personality trait stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to touch the tapestry. The effect has a Penetration of +12, sufficient perhaps to warn off apprentices or inexperienced magi. (Effect: base 4, +3 Sight, +2 Sun, +2 Room; Modifications: +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger, +6 penetration)''

===The Weight of All Perdition Be Upon You===

''Cr(Pe)Me(Co) 35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen +20, Unlimited use Expires: 70 Years On touching the tapestry, the target feels a scalding pain in whatever part of his body came into contact with it. The pain does no damage and fades over the next few seconds, but it feels like a deep burn and the memory lingers. Alongside the pain, the target hears a thousand demonic voices crying out for his soul inside his mind in some unholy language. The affected target must succeed in a Brave Personality Trait against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to pass the tapestry. If the target has previously been affected by the Come No Further effect, he receives a –3 penalty to the roll. (base 4, +1 Touch, +2 requisites; +10 unlimited/day, +10 penetration)''
''The Light of Fell Disease''
''PeCo 30 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Room Pen: +0 Byzantine politics can be as swift and brutal as any in Venice or Rome, and on more than one occasion Petalichus has resorted to baser measures to dispose of those who might stand in his way. This enchanted candle (created as a charged device with one charge per candle), when lit, unleashes the deadly disease Variola (Small Pox), affecting all in the same room as the candle. This version of the device has no Penetration, so cannot affect any potential targets with Magic Resistance. And as the Duration is Momentary, the disease is not communicable (however, in their weakened state, victims may become infected with further plagues and these may be passed on to others). All those affected by the effect must make a Stamina + Living Conditions Modifier + Wound Penalty + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Failing the roll means the target has contracted the disease. Each week that the target is attended to by a physician, he makes a Stamina + Medicine + (the worse of the Fatigue or Wound Penalty) + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to remain stable, or 15 to improve. If the target’s condition worsens, he loses a''
''Long-term Fatigue level that cannot be regained except through medical treatment. An improvement is represented by regaining a Long-term Fatigue Level. If the character goes beyond the Unconscious level, there is nothing more that can be done except to call for a priest. The candles that carry this effect are easily spotted by those who know what to look for. They bear small inscriptions that spiral up the shaft of the candle that may be recognized as having Perdo Corpus resonances, but to the untrained eye they may simply look more elaborate than is necessary for a simple candle. Quaesitor Valeria of the covenant of Donum Chanuti uncovered evidence that Petalichus had used such a device in the murder of Thomas Roxbury, a notary in the employ of House Guernicus, when his pursuit of Solar Magnus led him to Canterbury. (base 20 +1 Touch, +2 Room)''
''Dreams You Shall Not Wake From''
''CrIg 48 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Room Pen: +30, 1 charge This charged device, each charge in the form of a single bedsheet, is triggered through a target laying upon it. It contains a powerful Creo Ignem effect that creates a raging magical fire that starts at the sheet and instantly spreads to take in everything in the room (the extent of the magical target). The fire may spread beyond the room as the heat and flames burn naturally once the magical impetus finishes. In the round the device is triggered, all targets within the room take +20 damage from the intense searing fire. This is a magical attack and can be resisted. Until the fire is put out or the target(s) leave the area, they continue to take +10 damage each round from natural fire. Storyguides may want to consider further effects on the target building after such an explosive blaze. The impact table in ArM5, page 181, may help. Through subterfuge, Petalichus successfully deployed this device in his infamous defeat of Solar Magnus in Canterbury. He had learned of his enemy’s cyclic magic and knew when his magic resistance would be at its weakest. (base 15 +1 Touch, +2 Room; +15 penetration, +3 environmental trigger)''
''The Map of Many Places''
''In(Re)Im(An) 25 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Vision Pen: +0, 1/Day This device is a woven cloth map that has the ability to re-weave itself, redrawing the map to fit with its current location. It works by taking the image of the immediate area, as though from 100 paces straight up, and then re-weaving the threads in the map to match what it has seen. The effect is refined enough to pick out any constraining city walls and, if cast within those walls, will only map that area. The map is not accurate enough to represent smaller streets and alleys, or pick out individual buildings unless they are sizable, such as churches. If used with Hermetic Geometry Arcane Line, Circle, and Ring spells, the map reduces the Distance Level by 1 (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 95). This is cumulative with other tools. (base 1, +3 Sight Range, +4 Sight Target, +1 complexity)''
''The Convenient Door''
''ReTe(He) 25 R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Structure Pen: +0, 1/Day The small cloth chalk bag hanging on Petalichus’ belt is another of his enchantments. By using the chalk from the bag to draw an outline on a wall, the magi triggers an effect that opens up a hole in that wall or structure by moving the Terram or Herbem components of the wall aside. The result is a direct line of sight between the caster and open air or to some substance that is not part of the structure. Minor obstacles such as chairs, tables, or other furniture do not obstruct the effect. The effect is strong enough to affect stone and glass but not metal. The size of the holes created by the effect are determined by the size of the chalk outline, but they cannot be made larger than is necessary for the caster to step comfortably through. The Structure Target allows the effect to force holes through several walls in the same casting. This effect works no matter which surface the outline is drawn on — whether a wall, a ceiling, or a floor (though of course lead roofs cause this spell to fail at the last).''
''This is an unnatural movement and the walls knit back together at the end of the effect’s duration with little or no evidence of there having been a disturbance. Consistent with his sigil, the holes appear to be like tears through cloth. The chalk in the bag is non-magical and is incidental, being used simply to activate the effect. The effect itself is generated by the bag, which is decorated with images of doors on each of its four panels. (base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +3 Structure, +1 Herbam requisite, +1 affect stone)''
''Greater Numerologist’s Book''
''This heavy book brings together copies of De Astrologia (a work on astrology containing the Chaldean Observations), Parapegma (forecasts of the risings and settings of the stars), and Pros Thrasydaion (a mathematical work concerning conics and circles and their intersections). This unique collection of works, kept alive by the Cononites, serves as a focus for both Numerological and Astrological spell casting. Petalichus has enchanted several copies of this volume, including his own, with Sense the Hour as per The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 51. In addition, his own volume contains the following enchantments:''

===The Worldly Halysis===

''InTe 10 R: Arc, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen: +0, 3/Day This effect informs the caster of the exact distance, expressed in paces, from his current location to the location described by the Arcane Connection. This effect combines well with other spells using the Arcane Line Range, Arcane Circle Target and Arcane Ring Duration (all granted by the Hermetic Geometry Mystery Virtue) as it reduces the time the caster needs to spend calculating the distance between the caster and the target. Using this effect reduces the Distance Level (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 95) between the caster and his target by 3. So a target at Distance Level 8 (180 – 225 paces) can be targeted as though he were at Distance Level 5 (75 – 105 paces).''
''Although the effect provides an accurate number of paces between caster and target, this number must still be included in the caster’s calculations for remote spell-casting, hence the reduction in the Distance Level rather than an outright negation of it. The effect is named for the Halysis, an ancient Greek measuring chain used by mathematicians and engineers to ensure measurements were constant and correct. (base 2, +4 Arcane Connection; +2 3/day)''

===The Bodily Halysis===

''InCo 32 R: Arcane Connection D: Momentary T: Individual Pen: +30, 3/Day As The Worldly Halysis except that this effect operates through the form of Corpus and informs the caster of the exact number of paces between the caster and the target described by the Arcane Connection. (base 3, +4 Arcane Connection; +2 3/ day, +15 penetration)''
''Talisman: Distaff of Petalichus''
''Petalichus took a greatstaff in the shape of a distaff as his talisman, to represent his heritage. But the staff is full of mathematical resonances, from being carved and shaped with four sides rather than rounded smooth, to the complex ratios between the positioning of symbols and inscriptions up its shaft. These symbols are picked out in white against the deep black polish of the staff.''
''Attunements +4 control things at a distance (staff) +4 destroy things at a distance (staff)''

===The Invisible Eye Revealed (Variant)===

''InVi 29 R: Per, D: Sun, T: Touch Pen: +0, Constant Effect''
''This effect operates as per the spell of the same name (ArM5, page 157) with the exception that it has a constant effect, detecting scrying spells of up to level 30 (the base level of this effect is 15). Note that all scrying attempts are detected, whether they breach Petalichus’ Parma Magica or not. As Petalichus enchanted this effect into his talisman, he feels the effect of the spell each time he takes up or carries his staff. (base 15, +2 Sun; +4 constant effect)''

===The Gaze of Others===

''CrIg 17 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind, Pen: +0, 50/day Triggered by The Invisible Eye Revealed also installed in the talisman. When The Invisible Eye Revealed effect detects a scrying attempt, several of the white inscriptions on the staff glow with a soft light. The effect is subtle and barely noticeable in daylight, but Petalichus is a suspicious man and always keeps a watchful eye on his talisman when he doesn’t have it in his hand. (base 2, +1 Concentration; +6 levels 50/day, +5 item maintains concentration, +3 triggered effect)''
