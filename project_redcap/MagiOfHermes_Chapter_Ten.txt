''Concept: Driven by vengeance against her pater, she and her disfigured sister use magic to enhance their network of agents, giving them a great deal of mundane influence.''
''Marie-Philipe and Marie-Helene were sisters from a village near a covenant. When a magus of House Tytalus chose the younger — Marie-Helene — to become his apprentice, she begged for her sister to join them as well but the magus refused; he had no interest in wasting his time on a non-Gifted girl, even if she did exhibit some latent magical ability. A short while later a catastrophic fire ravaged the family home. Marie-Philipe survived although she was horribly scarred. Marie-Helene was convinced that her master was responsible for the fire, intending to rid his apprentice of a distraction to her magical development. Marie-Helene hid her sister away and cared for her, escaping at night to bring her food and share her lessons in Hermetic magic. Unfortunately, without either The Gift or having been opened to the Arts, Marie-Philipe was unable to replicate the simplest spells. When Marie-Helene passed her Gauntlet, she took the name “Persephone of Tytalus,” and her sister adopted the moniker “Kore.” The pair swore to get vengeance on Persephone’s master, and that he would have a spectacular, fiery end. This has nothing to do with the House tradition of beloved rivals; this is revenge, pure and simple. Persephone is rarely found without Kore nearby, although the elder sister tends to keep to the shadows to hide her scarred face. Persephone maintains a network of agents (see sidebar) although most are not aware that they work for her; she contacts them either through an intermediary or in disguise. Her agents are principally spies, gathering information that Kore sorts through for useful intelligence about their targets. Many of her spells and enchantments revolve around ways in which she can use her agents more''
''efficiently in her plans, which have tended to drift from revenge to general meddling in the politics of her tribunal.''

Unknown to her sister, her pater is observed at all times by mundane agents, who are occasionally assisted with purloined magical devices. She has launched several clandestine attacks against him using her Hex Ability, and has even managed to secure one of his lesser enchantments, knowing it to be an Arcane Connection. Kore knows full well that her actions could land her sister in serious trouble with the Hermetic authorities, and has been exceptionally careful to cover her tracks. Persephone can answer truthfully in front of the Quaesitores that she had no knowledge of her sister’s actions.''

''New Spells''
''Persephone has designed the following new spells.''
''Animal Spells''

===Remake the Tailor’s Craft===

''MuAn 15 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group Transforms a set of clothing into different clothes. The substance and color must be preserved, but the shape and number of the garments can be altered. Thus a peasant’s woolen smock can become a woolen dress, wimple, and cloak. An Intelligence + Finesse roll determines the quality of the new set of clothes; an Ease Factor of 6 is sufficient for a simple change, although the Ease Factor is 3 points higher if the new clothes are dramatically different from the old. The spell assumes that the clothing is in the main of animal origin — wool, felt, fur, leather, and silk — which is usually the case. A casting requisite of Herbam is needed to transform garments that are partly of plant origin, but items made solely of plant matter cannot be affected. Accouterments like wooden or metal fastenings remain unchanged. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group)''
''Imaginem Spells''

===Trigger the Distant Power===

''CrIm 5 R: Arc, D: Mom, T: Ind The caster specifies a particular noise that then momentarily sounds in the vicinity of an object, place, or person to which the caster has an Arcane Connection. The spell cannot duplicate a voice or say words. Persephone uses this simple spell to trigger a number of different effects in the charged items she makes and distributes to her agents. Each item is keyed to trigger its effect upon hearing a commonplace noise, like a whine, a buzz, or a chirrup easily attributable to an insect. (Base 1, +4 Arc)''

===Voice of the Leucrota===

''MuIm 4 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The target’s voice is changed so that it is wholly different. This can duplicate the voice of a specific person known to the caster, or a particular accent he has heard before, or simply change the voice to be different than the target’s own. This spell does not allow the target to speak a language that she does not know. An Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 can accurately replicate an accent, and a 9 is needed to duplicate a specific voice. Someone more familiar with the person mimicked may still perpetrate the falsehood. This is also Persephone’s favored spell used to humiliate an opponent she has bested in certamen — she often gives them an unnaturally squeaky or basso profundo voice. A leucrota is a mythical beast that can mimic the voices of men to lure them as prey. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Aura of Childlike Innocence===

''MuIm 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell is a variant of Aura of Ennobled Presence, except that it causes the target to appear more guileless, gullible, and naïve. The character gets a +3 to rolls to deflect suspicion''
''or convince others of his innocence. To those affected by the caster’s Gift, his apparent innocence and unblemished honor appears sanctimonious and self-righteous (originally in Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 96). (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''
''Mentem Spells''

===Catching the Eye===

''CrMe 15 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind''
''The caster momentarily attracts the target’s attention, sufficiently to make eye contact to follow up with a spell of Range: Eye. This spell is normally redundant given the spectacle of spell casting; however Persephone has both Quiet and Subtle Magic, and a spell at Range: Eye is far more subtle than one of Range: Voice. (Base 4, +3 Sight)''

===The Factor’s Roll Call===

''InMe 20 R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind This spell probes the mind of the target to reveal if he has ever heard a specific word. Persephone uses this spell to determine whether a given person is one of her agents — since she operates her agents remotely she instructs her factors to say an obscure word to all recruited agents. This spell therefore tells her if a person is in her employ. She has on occasion used it to discover whether her identity has been leaked. The word she most commonly uses is “shibboleth,” although theologians may have heard this word before. (Base 15, +1 Eye)''

===Music of the Unwanted Attention===

''InMe 25 R: Per, D: Mom, T: Hearing The caster is able to sense anyone who is currently aware of her. A person’s attention, regardless how fleeting, is heard as a musical chime, and each individual is represented by a different tone. She doesn’t detect any information about them other than they are aware of her existence. The information gained from this spell is only relevant for the moment that the spell is cast, and is only applicable to those who have an active interest in the caster’s presence. This spell operates by interrogating the common sense (see Art & Academe, page 33) for images of the caster. (Base 10, +3 Hearing)''

===Funding the Blackmailer’s Purse===

''InMe 30 R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind The caster reveals a deep-seated secret in the mind of the target. The caster must have some idea about the subject of the secret; this spell cannot be used to “fish” the mind for a random secret. Instead, based on a piece of scant information, the spell reveals all the sordid details of a shameful deed, embarrassing moment, or concealed history. For example, Persephone notices that Credo the grog flinches every time the word “chalice” is mentioned. This spell will reveal that in her youth Credo stole the sacramental chalice from her local church, that she dared not fence it after committing the deed, and that it lies buried in the packed earth beneath her sleeping pallet. (Base 25, +1 Eye)''

===My Old and Dear Friend===

''MuMe 20 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind The target’s memory is altered so that the caster is “remembered” to have performed a major favor for him in the recent past. The caster gets to choose in what manner she appears in the altered memory. The target cannot be convinced of the falsity of this memory until the duration of the spell expires, at which point he realizes the deception. (Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun, +1 complexity)''

''New Guideline: ReTe 4''
''Transport a target instantly up to five paces. Add one magnitude for 50 paces, two magnitudes for 500 paces, three magnitudes for one league, four magnitudes for seven leagues, and five magnitudes for a place to which you have an Arcane Connection.''

|}

===I Was Never Here===

''PeMe 5 R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind The target forgets meeting the caster. Prior contact between the caster and the target must be limited to a brief and relatively insignificant event occurring within the last day, and includes the casting of this spell. This spell is perfect for making a target forget seeing the maga overtly cast a spell, or causing a sentry to forget letting her through a gate. However, a person cannot be made to forget who stabbed him. (Base 4, +1 Eye)''
''Terram Spells''

===Short Step of the Ghost===

''MuTe(Au) 25 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part The stone in a section of wall momentarily becomes as permeable as mist, allowing the caster to step through. The wall solidifies behind her. It affects an area as large as a door, but the wall cannot be more than one foot thick. The highly unnatural substance that the section of wall briefly becomes does not affect its structural integrity. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 affect stone)''

===Invisible Hand of the Thief===

''ReTe 20 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind Instantly transports any single object to the hand of the caster. The object must be within range and be visible to the caster. Objects that are being held or worn can be affected by this spell, and may need casting requisites for material other than that covered by the Form of Terram — for example, Animal for wool, leather, bone, or ivory; and Herbam for wood, rope, or linen. If the target object is protected by Magic Resistance (such as an item worn by a magus), then the spell must have sufficient Penetration. The base level for this effect is that for a very unnatural motion. However, for instant transportation the Rego Corpus guidelines are consulted, which adds one magnitude for instant transportation over 5 paces, two magnitudes over 50 paces, and so forth.''
''(base 4, +2 Voice, +1 affect restrained objects, +1 for 50 paces transportation)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Persephone prefers to craft items in the form of jewelry, since most of the items are designed for her own use or that of her sister Kore.''
''Coin of Mirth''
''Persephone makes these Charged Items in reasonable quantity, and keeps them on hand should she need a distraction. She makes them in the form of a common coin of the realm, usually something of low value that she distributes to her unknowing dupes in exchange for street food or trinkets. She triggers them remotely using her Triggering the Distant Power spell, which can activate several coins at once. The spectacle of two or three people simultaneously erupting into spontaneous laughter is usually sufficient distraction to allow Persephone to cast a spell with vulgar magical effects and remain unnoticed.''

===Touch of Hilarity===

''CrMe 10 Pen 0, charged item R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Ind When activated, this coin causes the person who it is touching to burst into uncontrollable laughter. The target hoots, howls, chortles, guffaws, or otherwise expresses loud hilarity. The trigger for this effect is typically a chuckling sound. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Diam)''
''Bracelet of Clandestine Insignificance''
''This simple silver bangle is a Lesser Enchantment created by Persephone to avoid unwanted attention. It cost her two pawns of vis to make.''

===Hiding in Plain Sight===

''MuIm 14 Pen 0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind The visual and auditory species shed by the target acquire an anamorphic nature, tricking the viewer’s mind into misinterpreting what he is seeing. As long as the wearer of the bracelet acts in a non-threatening manner and draws no attention to herself, no-one will pay her the slightest notice. Their attention simply glides off her as being mundane and insignificant. For example, she can walk through a crowded room and no-one will notice her passing. But should she stop to talk to anyone, the illusion is lost for that individual. For the illusion to work, the victim must fail a Perception roll with a –3 penalty (since the illusion involves two senses). The Ease Factor for this roll is equal to the sum of a die roll, the victim’s Inattentive (or similar) Personality Trait, the wielder’s Perception, and the wielder’s Finesse score. The victim’s total must exceed the Ease Factor by 3 or more to reveal the illusion as false. See Houses of Hermes: Societates, pages 65–66 for more details of anamorphic illusions. Persephone is careful not to wear the bracelet wherever she may be in the company of magi, since she could be accused of scrying if they perceive the illusion. (base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Conc; +5 item maintains concentration, +5 24/day)''
''Signet of Hallam''
''This Invested item effects a specific disguise ­ — one impersonating Lord Richard of Hallam — that is commonly used by Persephone, Kore, or one of the maga’s trusted agents. The ring is made with two trigger words, one of which is used by male characters, and the other by female characters to initiate all of the same effects and also change the sexual characteristics of the target to those of a male. When the trigger word is said, each effect is initiated in the order presented below, one per round. Lord Richard of Hallam was a close friend of Persephone’s covenant, whose collusion proved very useful in a number of her schemes. When Richard died unexpectedly the covenant lost a powerful ally, so Persephone used her spells to take the place of the minor lord. After manufacturing an excuse for his prolonged absence, she took the time to make this item so that anyone could play''
''the role of the lord. She has gradually improved the efficacy of the ring over time, and has been handsomely compensated by her covenant. Hallam’s widow Joanna is aware of the subterfuge and is glad of it, since the second husband her family would match her with is a bore and an idiot. The covenant is careful not to use the role of Lord Richard to meddle in mundane politics, but merely to defend their own interests in the region. Persephone has not been so conscientious when she takes over the disguise, though. After a problem involving a churchman with the Magic Sensitivity Ability, she added an effect to hide the various magical transformations. The item is a signet ring made of gold, with the seal made from onyx. It was opened with 12 pawns of vis, and has been invested with 11 pawns’ worth of effects.''

===Face of Lord Richard of Hallam===

''MuCo 16 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Part Pen 0, 2/day This spell works just like Disguise of the New Visage, except that the effect can only duplicate the face of a single person — that of Lord Richard of Hallam. He has black hair and green eyes, and is clean shaven. The effect can be canceled at will, but can only be activated twice per day. This effect is triggered when the wearer of the ring rubs it and says either trigger word “vir Hallamus” or “mulier Hallamae.” (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +1 Part; +1 2/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''

===Voice of Lord Richard of Hallam===

''MuIm 9 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen 0, 2/day This spell works just like Voice of the Leucrota, except that the effect can only duplicate the voice of a single person — that of Lord Richard of Hallam. He has a deep voice with a distinctive Norman accent. The effect can be canceled at will, but can only be activated twice per day. This effect is triggered when the wearer of the ring rubs it and says either trigger word “vir Hallamus” or “mulier Hallamae.” (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Conc; +1 2/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''

===Clothes of Lord Richard of Hallam===

''MuAn(He) 16 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group Pen 0, 2/day This spell works just like Remake the Tailor’s Craft, except that the effect can only change the target’s clothes into those of a specific description: woolen doublet and hose of black with red ornamentation, a white linen shirt, leather riding boots and a riding cape. The outfit comes with a stylish felt hat bearing a red feather, and gloves. The effect can be canceled at will, but can only be activated twice per day. This effect is triggered when the wearer of the ring rubs it and says either trigger word “vir Hallamus” or “mulier Hallamae.” (Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group; +1 2/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''

===Body of the Virile Male===

''MuCo 11 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen 0, 2/day The target’s body assumes male physical characteristics without altering other aspects of appearance. The effect can be canceled at will, but can only be activated twice per day. This effect is triggered when the wearer of the ring rubs it and says the trigger word “mulier Hallamae.” (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc; +1 2/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''

===Masking the Odor of Magic===

''PeVi 34 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group Pen 0, constant effect Prevents the detection of any of the effects in this item by magic, unless the Intellego Vim spell is greater than 30th level. A character with the Magic Sensitivity Supernatural Ability must have a score of 6 or greater to detect the magic of this item. (Base effect (5), +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger)''
''Pigeon Amulet''
''Named after the bird stamped on its surface, this brass coin-shaped amulet has a hole in the top allowing it to be threaded onto a''
''necklace or leather thong. Each one is made as a pair from the same batch of metal, and are separated at the end of the enchantment process. One half is kept by the maga as an Arcane Connection to the other half; Persephone neatly labels these with the name of the owner of the other half, and hangs them on her wall. These Arcane Connections typically last for years. Persephone distributes these Charged Items to potential agents who she may wish to recruit at a later date, or to skilled operatives to whom she issues personal instructions.''

===Take Me Home===

''ReMe 25 Pen 0, charged item R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind When activated, this amulet causes the person who it is touching to have a nagging desire to travel to a place that is designated when the item is made. The sensation persists throughout the effect’s duration, and a week of this is usually sufficient to prompt the target to manufacture a reason to make the journey. The trigger for this effect is typically the buzz of a bee, which can be caused remotely using Persephone’s Triggering the Distant Power spell. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)''
''Fides Sororis''
''This Invested Item is physically the twin of Persephone’s talisman, made at the same time from the same batch of gold, and bearing seven strands of the maga’s hair as a fixed Arcane Connection. The ring was prepared for enchantment with 10 pawns of vis, and has been invested with 5 pawns’ worth of effects. Persephone gave this ring to her sister Kore.''

===Repulse the Unwanted Attention===

''ReCo 35 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen 0, 24/day This spell is identical to the effect in Persephone’s talisman, except that it was invented at Range Touch since this item is not a talisman. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Conc; +5 maintains concentration, +5 24/day)''

===Adopt the Sister’s Face===

''MuCo(Vi) 25 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Part Pen 0, 24/day The target’s face is changed to be that of Persephone of Tytalus. The face is always that of Persephone’s current appearance due to the presence of the indefinite Arcane Connection wrapped around the ring. The Vim requisite in this effect taints the target with magic, so that she also appears to have The Gift by those who investigate her magically, although the wearer temporarily gains the Magical Air Flaw. The effect is triggered by kissing the ring. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +1 Part, +1 requisite; +5 item maintains concentration, +5 24/day)''
''Talisman: Amor Sororis''
''Persephone’s talisman is a simple gold ring. Wound around the unadorned band are seven strands of her sister Kore’s hair, which are a fixed Arcane Connection. Kore possesses an identical ring with seven strands of Persephone’s hair, but the enchantments in''
''this ring are very different (see Fides Sororis earlier). The ring was prepared for enchantment with 10 pawns of vis, and currently has one pawns’ worth of space left. Persephone has instilled three effects into her talisman so far, as listed below.''
''Attunements +4 transform self +4 protect self +4 nobility''

===Repulse the Unwanted Attention===

''ReCo 30 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen 0, 24/day The ring confers a personal ward against people on the wearer of the ring. Only those without Magic Resistance are affected. If she is simply walking through a crowd the people are nudged aside to allow her to pass. Warded individuals cannot act across a ward in any manner, therefore if she is attacked, her opponents’ blows always go wide, causing them to miss. She is not protected from thrown weapons or missiles, though. The effect is triggered by holding the hand wearing the ring in front of the body, palm facing outward. (Base 15, +1 Conc; +5 item maintains concentration, +5 24/day)''

===Watchful Eye of the Caring Sister===

''InCo 25 R: Arc, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen 0, unlimited uses Reveals the general state of health of anyone to whom the item’s user has an Arcane Connection. Naturally, Persephone uses this effect to check on the status of her sister when the two are apart. The effect is triggered by turning the ring three times clockwise on the finger. (Base 4, +4 Arc; +10 unlimited uses)''

===Opening the Intangible Tunnel===

''ReVi 25 R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen 0, 1/day As the spell of the same name, except that the talisman takes the strain of concentrating on the Intangible Tunnel. Spells up to 20th level can be carried to the target of the Arcane Connection, which is commonly Kore. The effect is triggered by moving the ring from its customary position on the ring finger of the left hand, over to the middle finger. (Base effect, +4 Arc, +1 Conc; +5 item maintains concentration)''
