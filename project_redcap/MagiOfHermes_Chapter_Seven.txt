''Concept: This trader of goods and materials uses his magic to support his mercantile activities and his family, and overcome the social handicap of his Gift.''
''Lambert of Merinita was born into a merchant family, and a love of haggling and business was instilled in him at a very young age. The effects that Lambert’s Gift had on people prevented him from achieving any real success as a youth, despite his charisma and enthusiasm. Lambert cared greatly for his family and maintained close contact with them throughout his apprenticeship and beyond, and he was married and had several children before finishing apprenticeship. The obligations and joys of providing for his family have dominated his life. Lambert’s family makes its living by purchasing goods and materials and transporting them to where they can be sold at a profit. Lambert aids this business throughout his life by using his magic to find the most advantageous materials for purchase, and to transport these materials safely and quickly. Lambert focuses his magic around the Art of Mentem, Faerie Magic, and the mercantile activities of his family. Lambert is driven to haggle and make deals whenever he can, although his efforts in this field meet with mixed results. He is practiced in the art of bargaining, and becomes more so as he ages. He is also a skilled communicator with a formidable presence, yet The Gift makes it difficult for people to trust him; some (both human and faerie) who have forged agreements with Lambert often suspect that they have been poorly dealt with even if they can’t think of any reason why they should feel so. Magi, on the other hand, are protected from the effects of Lambert’s Gift, and so cutting deals with other members of the Order is a source of great joy for Lambert.''

''Initiation into the Mystery of Arcadian Travel''
''Lambert has undergone initiation into the Minor Virtue of Arcadian travel through the group of Merinitae called the Wayfarers, using the script presented on page 80 of Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults. During his Ordeal of Initiation, he made his way from Bayeux cathedral into a Faerie regio in the forested hills of Bayeux County, while being pursued by faerie boars. As a result of his initiation, Lambert''
''has acquired the Virtue Arcadian Travel and the Flaw Fear (swine). Also, Bayeux cathedral functions as a permanent Arcane Connection to Lambert. When using Arcadian Travel, Lambert creates charms with the skill Profession (storyteller). Lambert sets sections of his stories down on paper to serve as objects associated with the charm.''

Although it is clear that his easy smile and friendly demeanor are at least in part the product of practice, their effusiveness goes a fair way toward offsetting the detrimental social effects of The Gift. Activities in the last fifteen years: Lambert, 15 years out of apprenticeship, has children who are able to take care of themselves, and he even has a few grandchildren. Lambert has undergone Initiation in the mystery of Arcadian Travel through the Wayfarers (Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 80). Lambert leaves most of the face-to-face dealing in his family’s mercantile industry to his children, for fear of being accused of interfering with the mundanes (and because his children do not suffer from the corrosive social effects of The Gift). However, his love of bargaining frequently leads him into faerie auras and regiones to strike bargains with the fay. Much of Lambert’s magical research in this period of his life involves providing tools for his family to use. By this point of his life, Lambert’s mercantile activities have earned him the enmity of a powerful group of faeries. During this period, Lambert spent one season inventing Piercing the Faerie Veil and one season inventing The Inexorable Search, both with the assistance of Laboratory Texts. Lambert spent three seasons inventing Pull of Blood (with the help of unusual laboratory schedules and experimentation), four seasons inventing Scent of Loose Purses, and three seasons inventing Stench of Hate. Lambert spent one season copying Laboratory Texts to exchange for his casting tablet of the Locked Storehouse. Lambert spent three seasons serving House Merinita and the Wayfarers in conjunction with his Initiation into the Mystery of Arcadian Travel. During these fifteen years, Lambert gained 135 experience points in Abilities and 195 experience points in Arts (and an additional 39 from his affinity with Mentem).''

During these fifteen years Lambert gained 270 experience points in Arts (and an additional 23 experience in Mentem from his affinity).''
''Magi of Hermes New Spells''
''Lambert has developed the following new spells.''
''Animal Spells''

===Soothing Voice of the Stableman===

''ReAn 15 R: Voice D: Sun, T: Individual This spell implants the suggestion that the caster is a safe and helpful friend into the mind of the target animal. The spell maintains this suggestion in the mind of the animal for the duration of the spell, regardless of the actions of the caster. This spell can not remove the sense of unease that an animal will feel when exposed to a Gifted character, but an animal of bestial intelligence will not be able to associate its unease with the caster. Horses subject to this spell can be used as mounts by magi who do not have the Gentle Gift, but the uneasiness of such mounts makes them skittish and fearful. In situations where the mood of the animal is important, the Ease Factor of appropriate rolls should be 3 higher than normal and subject to one or more additional botch dice. The effect of the Blatant Gift is sufficiently strong to make animals frenzied when they are both subject to this spell and exposed to a Blatantly Gifted caster. Animals that are Warped from long-term exposure to this spell often become belligerent and frightened all of the time. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 size)''
''Aquam Spells''

===Patch of Drought===

''PeAq 10 R: Voice D: Momentary, T: Individual The caster destroys the water in a patch of mud or a puddle up to 20 paces in diameter. Repeated use of this spell can make travel using a cart significantly faster in wet''
''weather and possible on even dirt roads during adequate weather. (Base 4, +2 Voice)''
''Corpus Spells''

===Pull of Blood===

''InCo 20 R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Bloodline, Faerie This spell informs the caster of the direction and distance to each living descendant of the target. Lambert frequently casts this spell upon himself to keep track of his large family. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Bloodline)''
''Herbam Spells''

===Locked Storehouse===

''MuHe (Te) Level 45 R: Touch, D: Year +1, T: Structure, Ritual, Faerie This Spell Changes a building and the building’s contents into a large rock of hard igneous stone for a year and a day. The rock is typically significantly smaller than the altered building (having approximately the same mass as the building), and is buried to the depth of the building’s foundation. If there is any material containing animal products in the building (such as leather or wool), then the spell must be cast with an Animal casting requisite or the spell will not function. Over the duration of the spell, the target building and its contents age normally but do not suffer decay in any other respect; Thus no mold or water damage affect the building’s contents, but foodstuffs that have been aged for a year and a day would still be far from appetizing. Lambert has traded to acquire a casting tablet (Covenants page 89) of the spell Locked Storehouse; he does not know the spell himself. The casting tablet specifies the use of three pawns of Muto vis and six pawns of Terram vis. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +4 Year+1, +3 Structure, +1 complexity)''
''Mentem Spells''

===Missive of Memory===

''CrMe 40 R: Arcane Connection, D: Moon, T: Individual This spell creates a complete memory in the mind of the target. The target retains this memory until the duration of the spell expires. After the spell expires, the target may still recall those times when he dwelt on the memory. This spell-induced memory itself is false and may be discovered as such with an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (in the same manner as a memory created by the spell Memory of the Distant Dream). Lambert frequently uses this spell for communication with distant associates (but not with magi who are, as a nearly universal rule, uncomfortable leaving Arcane Connections with others). To draw attention to the information that he wants to convey, Lambert typically creates memories for the target’s very recent past that are clearly impossible, such as a memory of the target and a talking statue having had a long conversation on a snowy mountaintop within the last ten minutes. While this spell only takes a moment to cast, the magus needs to have a clear understanding of the memory that he wants to create in his own mind before creating it in the mind of the target. If the magus is not prepared, he cannot create a complex memory lasting more than a moment, or a longer memory that contains any great detail and is not repetitive. The preparation of any complex memory takes at least as long for the magus to create as the elapsed time of the memory that is created. Lambert specifically designed Missive of Memory to not Warp his second daughter. (Base 5 +4 Arcane Connection, +3 Moon)''

===Blissful Messenger===

''MuMe 30 R: Touch, D: Until, T: Individual, Faerie, Ritual This spell alters the target’s recollection of an event, changing the memories of what actually occurred into memories of a''
''different event decided upon by the caster. This spell is undone by speaking to a specific individual about the altered memories, and the individual who releases the spell must be included in the altered memories in some significant way. For example, the individual could be discussed, the memories could include a prominently placed picture of the individual, or the individual could be “present” in the altered memories. Often the spell is cast to change the recollections of an event into the recollections of a conversation specifying exactly how the spell is to be broken. A Tytalus maga who had need of sending agents to areas where they might be subject to investigation by Mentem spells convinced Lambert’s mater to allow Lambert to study the Lab Text for this spell as an apprentice. Lambert then used the spell for the benefit of the Tytalus who compensated Lambert’s mater for the service. The vis cost of performing the ritual, and the rarity of people willing to trust a Gifted magus sufficiently to allow their memories to be altered, prevents this from being a frequently used tool. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +4 Until)''

===Scent of Loose Purses===

''InMe 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Smell The target of this spell can detect desire and interest as a scent given off by any mind in the target’s vicinity. The more powerful the emotion of desire felt by a person, the stronger a smell that the target of Scent of Loose Purses will detect from them. Lambert frequently casts this spell on his family and people in his employ to help them learn to read the emotions of people with whom they come in contact. Oftentimes Lambert will have someone who does not have Scent of Loose Purses cast upon her give her impressions of people to someone who does, so that they both learn to perceive cues without the aid of magic. (Base 5, +1 Touch +2 Sun, +2 Smell)''

===Stench of Hate===

''InMe 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Smell The target of this spell can detect antipathy, dislike, and hate in all of its forms as a''
''scent given off by any mind in the target’s vicinity. The more powerful the emotion of antipathy that is felt by a person, the stronger the smell produced by their thoughts is to the target of Stench of Hate. Lambert frequently casts this spell on his family and people in his employ to help them learn to read the emotions of people with whom they come in contact. (Base 5, +1 Touch +2 Sun, +2 Smell)''

===Tread of Fellow Travelers===

''InMe 30 R: Road, D: Diameter, T: Group, Faerie The caster learns the number, state of consciousness, direction and distance to the nearest group of minds on the road he is on in one direction (apart from any group that the caster is in). The caster continues to sense this information for the duration of the spell. This spell and similar magics are common among members of House Merinita. Road Range provides practitioners of Faerie Magic with a tool that can cast spells at very long ranges fairly easily. Such spells, however, can not be cast on targets that are not sensed because of the law of Arcane Connections (ArM5 page 80). Tread of Fellow Travelers allows the caster to sense targets and thereby cast other spells of Range Road upon them. (Members of House Merinita have developed similar spells using other Hermetic Forms). (Base 5, +2 Road, +1 Diameter, +2 Group)''

===Familial Secrets===

''InMe 30 R: Personal, D: Momentary, T: Bloodline, Faerie By casting this spell, the magus learns what all of his descendants believe to be the answer to a question chosen by the magus at the time of casting. This spell functions in a manner similar to the spell Posing the Silent Question (ArM5 page 149). It is not always obvious to the caster which answer came from which descendant. To be certain which descendant a particular answer came from, the caster must typically make a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 3 plus the number of descendants that are affected by the spell (this Ease Factor can be higher if the caster is unfamiliar with some''
''of his or her descendants). The caster does not need to possess Arcane Connections to his descendants for this spell to function. This spell works through the connection of blood. Lambert specifically designed Familial Secrets to not Warp members of his bloodline (ArM5 page 92). (Base 15, +3 Bloodline)''

===Oath Breaker’s Confession===

''InMe 35 R: Eye, D: Bargain & Momentary, T: Individual, Faerie Like all spells of Bargain Duration, this spell is cast immediately after the caster strikes a bargain with the target and only takes effect if the target breaks her part of the bargain within one year (ArM5 page 92). If it should come to pass that the target of Oath Breaker’s Confession breaks her agreement, then the caster instantly becomes aware that the bargain has been broken and also learns exactly why and how the target believes that she broke the agreement. (Base 15, +1 Eye, +3 Momentary & Bargain)''

===Opinions of the Masses===

''InMe 35 R: Personal, D: Concentration, T: Hearing When this spell is cast, the magus chooses a specific question. For the duration of the spell, the caster will hear a voice answering this question from each mind that he comes in contact with. The thoughts of minds that have dwelled heavily on the magus’s question are perceived as clear voices, the thoughts of minds that have given the matter little thought are perceived as loud whispers. Minds that have never considered the issue (and minds that are protected by Magic Resistance that the spell failed to penetrate) do not make any sound at all. Lambert has on occasion, by use of this spell, heard the opinions of spirits and invisible creatures to which he would have otherwise have been oblivious. If the caster is surrounded by many people, the noise generated by this spell can interfere with the caster’s ability to hear normal sounds. The Ease Factor of rolls involving listening should be increased if the caster is surrounded by people with strong opinions while this spell is in effect. (Base 15, +1 Concentration, +3 Hearing)''

===Family Gathering===

''Mu(In)Me 40 R: Personal, D: Concentration T: Bloodline, Faerie This spell alters the perceptions of the caster and all of those people who are descended from him or her. The affected people think themselves to be in a large, comfortable, well-lit room sitting around a table sufficiently large to seat every member of the bloodline, rather than at their actual locations. Those affected by the spell perceive their relatives to be with them in this room. The room itself is heavily influenced by the caster’s wizard’s sigil. The members of the bloodline are able to speak to one another as if they were in the same room. If a member of the bloodline is asleep when Family Gathering is cast, the spell will not wake that family member; instead that person will experience the spell as a dream and he will have no easier of a time remembering the meeting than he would have remembering any other dream. The words and actions of a dreaming person are often, but not always, sufficiently odd to alert other participants to his or her state. During the spell’s duration, none of the family are able to receive information from their normal senses. (In terms of the mind as explained in Art and Academe, the forms and images collected by the target’s senses are overwritten in the target’s common sense by the Family Gathering spell). The targets of this spell are still able to move and control their bodies, but their inability to perceive their actual surroundings makes this a dangerous proposition. Prior to inventing this spell, Lambert on occasion spontaneously cast a Range: Personal, Target: Bloodline version of Words of the Unbroken Silence and used Familial Secrets to communicate with his children, but he found such communication to be very taxing. Lambert created Family Gathering to facilitate clear communication. This spell is specifically designed to not Warp members of Lambert’s bloodline. (Base 15, +1 Concentration, +3 Bloodline, +1 Intellego requisite)''

===Calm Mind of Resolute Behavior===

''PeMe 20 R: Personal, D: Diameter, T: Individual For the duration of this spell, all emotions are banished from the caster’s mind. This makes the caster unable to feel fear, doubt,''
''hope, or any other emotion. Any effort to manipulate the caster based on his emotions will automatically fail. The caster can make no rolls based on his Personality Traits for the duration of the spell. Despite the temporary absence of emotions, the caster’s goals and priorities remain unchanged and the caster retains recollections of emotions that he has previously felt. Lambert’s mater believed that this spell was an essential tool for anyone who dealt with the faeries. She believed that casting Calm Mind of Resolute Behavior, to provide Lambert with a moment’s clear reflection before embarking on an activity that might be influenced by the persuasion of charismatic faeries, would save her apprentice from many unwise decisions. Lambert casts Calm Mind of Resolute Behavior when he has an important choice to make and wants to see how he would approach the problem without the complications of his emotions coloring the issue. Lambert finds casting this spell to be quite unpleasant, though, and he greatly fears the possible consequences of miscasting a Perdo Mentem spell on himself. (Base 15, +1 Diameter)''

===Blindness of Involuntary Obstinacy===

''PeMe 40 R: Sight, D: Concentration, T: Group The targets of this spell become, for the duration of the spell, completely unable to perceive a particular object or entity chosen by the caster while casting the spell. The senses of the targets still work properly, but the minds of the targets are prevented from concluding that the specified person or object exists. In the terms presented in Art and Academe, this spell removes the ability of the common sense to receive or integrate  images of a specified object or entity. Lambert frequently specifies himself as the unperceivable object while using this spell. (Base 10, +3 Sight, +1 Concentration, +2 Group)''

===Mind Cleansed of Treachery===

''PeMe 45 R: Eye, D: Bargain & Momentary, T: Individual, Faerie Like all spells of Bargain Duration, this spell is cast immediately after the caster strikes a bargain with the target, and only takes effect if the target breaks his part of the bargain''
''(ArM5 page 92). If it should come to pass that the target of this spell breaks the agreement within a year of the date when the deal was made, then the target’s memory is destroyed, removing every stored idea that the target possesses and his sense of identity. All General Abilities (including languages) are retained, but knowledge of Academic, Arcane, Martial, and Supernatural Abilities are lost, as are all Arts. The target’s imagination, which stores images, is not affected, so he recognizes the faces of people he knows, places he has been, and songs he has heard, but lacks all knowledge about those things such as names, locations, emotional importance, and so forth. Lambert secured a Lab Text for this spell from the Merinita who developed it, in exchange for a copy of the Lab Text for Oath Breaker’s Confession. Lambert wanted to have a spell that provided a profoundly serious consequence for breaking an agreement, and the creator of Mind Cleansed of Treachery wished to acquire a spell that left its targets in a condition that could still be negotiated with. (Base 25, +1 Eye, +3 Momentary & Bargain)''
''Vim Spells''

===Wrappings of Metaphysical Iron===

''ReVi Gen R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual This spell wards an object from being touched or manipulated by faeries or faerie magic. Faeries with Might greater than the spell’s level are not restrained by this spell, nor are faeries that resist the spell’s Penetration. Lambert’s version of this spell was developed from laboratory notes made by a Merinita magus with the virtue of Spell Potency (The Mysteries Revised Edition page 31 or Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults page 6) concerning faeries. Lambert is unable to cast this spell unless he wraps an iron chain around the protected item at the time of the casting. Due to the influence of the iron chain, this spell is cast with a Potency Bonus of +7. Lambert finds that faeries rarely confront him about his use of this spell when he casts it on goods that he brings into their lands, but they become exceedingly displeased by the spell when it is used upon any item that is native to their home. (Base Effect, no modifier Ring to Sun)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Lambert has developed or traded for these enchanted items.''
''Coins of LooseTongued Patrons''
''Lambert acquired these two silver coins through trade with a fellow magus. Each coin bears a crown on one side and a likeness of Mercere on the other. The image of Mercere is laughing on the Coin of Enthusiastic Patrons, and grimacing on the Coin of Petulant Customers. Each of the two coins is a lesser enchanted device created with three pawns of vis. Lambert does not always keep these items to himself; rather they are frequently held by other members of his family. Lambert finds that the most valuable use of the coins is not in using them to strike advantageous bargains, but in allowing his family to receive copious accurate feedback regarding what people think of their merchandise (indeed, frequent use of the coins could lead to Warping of his family).''

===Blessing of Enthusiastic Patrons===

''ReMe Level 25 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch D: Sun, T: Room When the coin enchanted with Blessing of Enthusiastic Patrons is touched to the wall of a room, the coin enchants the room to alter the proclivities of people within it. People within the enchanted room are compelled to dwell on and talk about the positive and desirable qualities of any merchandise that is shown or discussed. Use of this effect adds a modifier of −6 to any Bargain rolls made by purchasers affected by the spell. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch +2 Room)''

===Curse of Petulant Customers===

''ReMe Level 25 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch D: Sun, T: Room''
''When the coin enchanted with Curse of Petulant Customers is touched to the wall of a room, the coin enchants the room to alter the proclivities of people within it. People within the enchanted room are compelled to dwell on and speak about any negative aspects and flaws that they perceive with any merchandise that is shown or spoken about. Use of this effect adds a modifier of +6 to any Bargain rolls made by purchasers affected by the spell. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch +2 Room)''

===Doorframe of the Wary Steward===

''Lambert was unable to create the Coins of Loose-Tongued Patrons for himself. He exchanged the following invested device to acquire them. At no point does Lambert posses a copy of this device, but he does have Lab Texts for its creation that he would be willing to part with for a suitable price. This is a door frame of maple and hazel that was incorporated into the structure of a covenant. On the top of the frame is a small hollow with a nail driven into it. A tiny bell was designed to be hung upon this nail. The frame was opened using eight pawns of vis. When the doorframe was delivered, it had one invested power that took up four of the door’s eight pawns of capacity for enchantment.''

===Doorframe of the Wary Steward===

''InMe 35, 0 penetration R: Special, D: Momentary, T: Individual When any creature passes through this doorframe, the enchantment determines whether or not that creature believes that they intend any harm towards the people who dwell within the covenant. If the creature does so believe, then the door frame shakes, causing the bell affixed to the doorframe to ring. As a Mentem effect this power will not function on animals, and also as a Hermetic effect it is restrained by the Limit of the Infernal. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Range Touch equivalent, +1 non-standard range, +10 levels unlimited uses per day)''
''Magi of Hermes Granary Chest''
''This is a large oaken chest with brass hardware of simple design. The chest measures two and a half feet wide, a foot and a half deep, and foot and a half tall. The Granary Chest is an invested device opened with eight pawns of vis (opening only the wood, as the highest capacity component). The chest is invested with three powers.''

===Convenient Warehouse===

''MuHe 24 Pen +0, constant effect R: Personal, D: Day (constant), T: Room Any item consisting entirely of plant material that is placed completely within the chest is shrunken to the size of a grain of wheat until it is removed from the chest. Linen bags filled with grain, vegetables, or fruit are the items most commonly stored within the chest by Lambert’s family. Shrunken materials that are kept within the chest for long periods of time can Warp, often becoming unnaturally shaped. Lambert’s family has found it often difficult to find a particular grain-sized item within the chest. They have taken to only placing items stored in colored linen bags into the chest, assigning certain bag colors to particular contents. This''
''has helped to reduce difficulties, but has not completely eliminated them. (Effect: Base 3, +2 Day, +2 Room, +1 excessive size change; Modifications +1 activation twice per day, +3 environmental trigger)''

===Carpentry of Brass===

''MuHe(Te) 10 Pen +0 1/day R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual This power transforms the wood of the chest into brass matching the fittings on it. It is triggered by rapping on the chest seven times in rapid succession. (Effect: Base 4, +2 Sun)''

===Charm Versus Dampness===

''ReAq 9 Pen +0, constant effect R: Personal, D: Sun (constant), T: Room This power slowly moves any liquids out of the chest over a period of minutes and prevents any liquids from slowly seeping or dripping into the chest (although the power is not strong enough to prevent liquids from being poured into the chest). (Effect: Base 1, +2 Sun, +2 Room; Modifications +1 level 2 activations per day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''
''Token of the Harvest Evening''
''This lesser enchanted device is a small wooden hourglass about the size of a chess piece bearing sulfur inlays. This device is enchanted with the following power.''

===Freshness of the Harvest Evening===

''CrHe 14 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Day (constant), T: Room All plant material kept in the same room as the Token of the Harvest Evening is preserved from decay and rot until either the plant material or the token is removed from the room. Materials kept within the same room as the token for long periods of time will undergo Warping from the continuous magical effect. Lambert’s family most frequently keeps the Token of the Harvest Evening inside the Granary Chest. (Effect: Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Room; Modifications +1 two activations per day, +3 environmental trigger)''
