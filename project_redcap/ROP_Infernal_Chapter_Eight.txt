===Corrupted Beasts===

''Corrupted beasts can become so in a number of different ways. Some are mundane beasts corrupted directly by the power of a demon, while others are born corrupted after a coupling between a demon and a beast. Creatures that dwell in an Infernal aura become corrupted by the very nature of the area; this may only become apparent in the offspring of animals moving into a weak Infernal aura, but is a result of Infernal Warping in stronger auras. Certain Infernal auras (see Chapter 1: The Infernal Realm, Infernal Auras) may corrupt a creature overnight. Finally, some diabolists and Infernalists have the power to create corrupted beasts, either intentionally or as an unintended side effect of their Powers.''
''To create the game statistics of a corrupted beast, start with the statistics of a mundane beast (for example, using the rules in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 38–43), and apply the Corrupted Beast Flaw, described below. Balance this Flaw with a Virtue, or, if the beast has been corrupted for a long time, or was born in such a state, apply more Flaws to acquire further Virtues. Virtues and Flaws for corrupted beasts may only be chosen from the list below, and are described on the following pages. The corpse of a corrupted beast typically contains one pawn of vis for each 5 Might Points it possessed.''

===Corrupted Beast===

''Minor Supernatural Flaw, animals only The creature has been corrupted by Infernal power, and acquires an Infernal Might of 5. The negative side of its character is brought to the fore and it receives one sinful Personality Trait at +6, such as Violent, Gluttonous, or Lustful. As part of the corruption, the beast takes on some sort of disgusting or repellent appearance, decreasing its Presence to –6. However, should the''
''animal make any attempt to scare or intimidate an opponent, this should be treated as a Presence of +6. Despite the creature’s deformity, it is possible (although difficult) to pass the animal off as a natural member of its species. Finally, the creature is afflicted with the Tainted with Evil Flaw, which affects the reactions of both humans and other animals towards it. Corrupted beasts do not react negatively to The Gift.''

===Demonic Weakness===

''Minor Supernatural Flaw, corrupted beasts only''
''The beast has a weakness similar to those of demons. Choose an appropriate limitation from the list given in Chapter 4: The Infernal Legions, Demonic Weaknesses. Corrupted beasts cannot, however, have the Ordering or Compulsion weaknesses.''

|}

===Ferocity===

''Minor General Virtue, animals only Like companion and magus characters, the animal has a Confidence score of 1. However, it can only use Confidence in situations where its corrupt nature is''
''triggered, such as when hunting children or attacking a priest. Describe a situation which activates the Confidence of the creature; in such circumstances the creature has 3 Confidence Points. Some creatures have this Virtue without it being derived from an Infernal source.''

===Horrifying Appearance===

''Major Supernatural Flaw, corrupted beasts only''
''The creature is hideously deformed in some waythat is a major hindrance in its life. Such a deformity may have some minor side benefit (a creature without a skeleton can seep through cracks, for example), but prevents the animal from ever being passed off as a member of its original species.''

===Greater Infernal Power===

''Major Supernatural Virtue, corrupted beasts only''
''Choosing this Virtue adds 5 to the Infernal Might of the corrupted beast and gives the creature an Infernal Power, which it may activate by spending points from its Might Pool. Design the effect as an Infernal Power (see Chapter 10: Maleficia), with a level of effect that cannot exceed the corrupted beast’s (Infernal''
''Might + 10). Such a Power typically costs its magnitude in Might Points to activate, and has an Initiative bonus equal to Quickness + magnitude. A given Power is  appropriate for this Virtue only if it requires a Penetration Total to work. (Otherwise, it is a Lesser Infernal Power.) To calculate a Penetration Total, see ArM5, page 191. Corrupted beasts may have this Virtue more than once, each for a different Power, and Infernal Might increases for each Power acquired.''

===Lesser Infernal Power===

''Minor Supernatural Virtue, corrupted beasts only''
''Choosing this Virtue adds 2 to the Infernal Might of the corrupted beast and gives the creature an Infernal Power, which either affects it constantly or may be activated by spending points from its Might Pool. Design the effect as an Infernal Power (see Chapter 10: Maleficia, making sure to adjust the level for constant effect or maintaining concentration if appropriate (and ignoring other effect modifications). The level of effect cannot exceed the corrupted beast’s Infernal Might. A Power granted by this Virtue typically costs 0–2 Might Points to activate and has an Initiative''

==Example Horrifying Appearances==

''The creature has a pair of huge but useless wings, which hang limply at the sides of its body. The creature’s skin is transparent, so that its organs can be seen pulsating within its flesh. The creature has a snake’s body instead of hindquarters, forcing it to move with a combined crawl and slither. The creature lacks an internal skeleton. It can force itself into its original form for short periods, but soon collapses into a puddle of hair, teeth, and claws, oozing slowly along the ground. There is a head at each end of the creature’s body, or in the center of its back.''

''bonus equal to magnitude. A given Power is only appropriate for this Virtue if it does not require a Penetration Total; if the Power would have to exceed the Magic Resistance of a target to operate (even if a given target might lack such), then it must be a Greater Infernal Power instead. Corrupted beasts may have this Virtue more than once, each for a different Power, and Infernal Might increases for each Power acquired.''

''vering heads protruding from its massive shoulders. The two heads are cursed with independent minds that hate each other, and each would like nothing more than to bite the other; it is only because the hound’s necks are too short that it cannot. The dog is covered in gray fur in the few areas that are not affected by mange, which has left patches of puffy, purulent red flesh.''
''This corrupted beast was created by a diabolist to be a guard for his sanctum. He controls it with an Infernal charm, but is fearful of the day that this charm fails, for he knows that the dog hates him.''

''with bloodshot eyes, fangs in its mouth, and hooves of iron.''
''This horse is one of three created by an Infernalist magus in a tribunal at the fringes of the Order by repeated applications of a tainted version of Steed of Vengeance (MuAn 35). There were many failures before he successfully created these three corrupted beasts. Because the untainted version of the spell is wellknown, he is able to use the steeds in front of other magi with impunity.''
