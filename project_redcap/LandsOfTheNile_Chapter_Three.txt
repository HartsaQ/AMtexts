''The following animals are found throughout Egypt, Nubia, and Ethiopia. These creatures are documented in the bestiaries of Mythic Europe. Region-specific beasts can be found in their respective chapters. Other animals native to the region can be found in Between Sand & Sea. Another notable animal found in this region is the lion: statistics for a mundane lion can be found in The Book of Mundane Beasts, a free supplement for Ars Magica Fifth Edition that can be found on Atlas Game’s website. A magical version of the lion is presented in Realms of Power: Magic, page 60, along with a description of the panther or pard (page 61), who also frequents these lands.''

==Asp (Aspis)==

''The asp or cobra is a fearsome serpent found throughout the lands of the Nile. It can grow to ten feet long, and spread an awe-inspiring hood from the sides of its head. Asp venom is so potent that the snake keeps its mouth wide open when moving, and the venom steams out wilting nearby vegetation. Asps are particularly vulnerable to Enchanting Music; anyone with this Virtue can automatically enchant them without a roll. To avoid this, if asps see anyone with a musical instrument they press one ear to the ground and plug the other with the tip of their tail. For the statistics of the asp, start with the statistics of the adder from the free online supplement Book of Mundane Beasts (or the Appendix of Realms of Power: Magic), and increase Size to –3 (which adds 2 to Strength and Damage, and subtracts 1 from Quickness, Initiative, and Defense). Asp venom is very potent; the Stamina roll to avoid its effects has an Ease Factor of 9, and failure results in an Incapaci''
''tating Wound. Medicine rather than Chirurgy is required to assist recovery from this wound.''

==Catoblepas==

''The catoblepas (plural catoblepones) is a bull-sized creature that lives around the upper reaches of the Nile Valley, in Alodia and Ethiopia. It is rumored that in the Slavelands they congregate in vast migratory herds. It has a downward-hanging face on its over-sized head; a fact for which one should be grateful, since its gaze is fatal. The creature is so slow that it takes a round for it to lift its head, and it must make eye contact to slay. The catoblepas’s eyes are so large that it is difficult to avoid its gaze, even in combat. Fortunately for magi, the Penetration of this power is weak. The breath of the catoblepas is noxious, and it exhales clouds of vapor upon vegetation, making them horribly poisonous before consuming them. Characters might first encounter a catoblepas while investigating why a crop has become toxic overnight. The scales that cover a catoblepas are impervious to metal and wood, making the creature difficult to kill. Despite its deadly abilities, the catoblepas is a relatively docile animal, although disinclined to move due to the ponderous weight of its head. It can barely stagger more than a few paces before needing rest and food; needless to say it can be a nuisance once it finds a patch of good forage.''

==Crocodile==

''The crocodile or corkendrile is a feared killer of the Nile River and its tributaries. The enemy it fears is the mongoose, who not only seeks out its nest to destroy its''
''young, but will even crawl down its throat and eat it from the inside out. The crocodile described here is a modest fifteen feet long; there are reports of specimens reaching thirty feet (Size +5) or more.''

==Elephant==

''An elephant’s nature is that once it falls over it cannot get back up again; they lean against trees rather than lie down to sleep. Cunning hunters in Africa chop part of the way through an elephant’s favorite leaning post, so that it breaks when he uses it. Elephants are preyed upon by dragons and by immense serpents that live near the Nile River, yet they are terrified by the sound of a pig squealing, which can do them no harm. The elephant is a creature that has no desire to copulate. If they wish to conceive, an elephant and his mate must both eat of the same mandragora root. The female remains pregnant for two years, and has just one baby at a time. The elephant can live for three hundred years.''

==Hippopotamus==

''These huge creatures are a familiar sight to the people who dwell near the Nile. They seem docile when wallowing in the mud at the river’s edge, but hippopotamuses are aggressive and territorial, and do not tolerate other users of the river. They reluctantly make way for any boat bigger than themselves, but smaller vessels are liable to be capsized by the sudden emergence of a submerged hippopotamus. They emerge from the river at night to graze, and fatalities can occur if the creatures believe that their retreat back to the river’s safety''

=An Ethiopian Bestiary=

''has been cut off. Hippopotamuses walk backwards when breaking into fields to feast on crops in order to fool those who would track them.''

==Hyena==

''In the thirteenth century hyenas (Arabic dhubba) are found throughout the Levant, North Africa, Iraq, Persia, and lands beyond. These striped hyenas can be trained and tamed like dogs, even to the extent of becoming part of a dog pack if raised with hounds. Although not sacred to the ancient Egyptians, hyenas were used in hunting desert game. Some greater African specimens (Size +1) may be significantly larger than the standard sized versions detailed here and their Middle Eastern cousins (also Size –1). These fell beasts are often ridden by jinn or witches. The hyena is also a common animal form for ghul to assume.''
''Hyena of Virtue (Crocotta)''
''The Hyena of Virtue, known as the crocotta or kynolykos (Greek: “dog-wolf”), hails from Ethiopia and is believed to be the product of a hyena and a lion. These spotted hyenas are larger (at least Size +1), appear to shift sexes readily (as per the Sex Shift Virtue) and are comparatively much stronger and faster (Strength +4, Quickness +3, and Tough Hide Quality) than their mundane cousins. Add the Improved Characteristics Virtue, the Tough Virtue and the Tainted by Evil Flaw. They are also both more violent (add the Aggressive Quality and increase their Brawl score to 5) and less cowardly (replace Cowardly with Fierce +3 Personality Trait). Unlike their lesser cousins, the crocotta has real Intelligence (Int +2) and a laughing humanlike cackle with improved powers of mimicry (equivalent to speaking Arabic 3) that they use to trick human prey.All crocotta possess the Greater Immunity: Steel Virtue and many have the ability to enthrall their victims as per the Entrancement Ability. Some crocotta can strike dogs dumb if their shadow falls across them, and can paralyse any creature they look at thrice. A stone found in the body of a Hyena of''

''successfully bitten a foe may roll in the following round. When a crocodile rolls, it can twists away a chunk of the flesh of its victim, doing +6 damage without an attack roll, although the victim gets a Soak roll ignoring Protection from armor, since the crocodile’s teeth have already penetrated. More often however, the death roll is not used to inflict damage. Rather, it is used to drag the victim beneath the surface of the water. The crocodile then uses its Amphibious Quality to wait for the victim to drown. If a character is being drowned by a crocodile, the character may attempt to break free of the crocodile’s jaws each round. This requires the character to overcome a successful Grapple attack with a Grapple Strength of 10. If the character does break free, the crocodile is likely to bite again. Natural Weapons: A crocodile’s jaws have the following combat characteristics: Init 0, Attack +4, Defense +1, Damage +3. This excludes the Crushing Jaws Quality (see later). Its scales are legendarily tough, so it has been assumed''
''to have Protection 5 in addition to its Virtues and Qualities. Appearance: Fifteen to eighteen feet long, this immense beast is covered in thick scales that can be colored in shades of yellow, green, and brown; indeed, its name is said to come from the yellow color of the crocus. However, these scales provide perfect camouflage both in the water and out.''
''A crocodile can hold its breath for half an hour if moderately active, and two hours if inactive. Crocodiles are camouflaged when in the water, and receive a +3 to all Stealth rolls made when stationary or moving slowly. They automatically win Initiative and receive a +3 to Attack totals on the first round of combat if they take their victim by surprise. A crocodile’s Crushing Jaws Quality adds +3 to damage; however, the muscles that open a crocodile’s jaws are quite weak and they can be held closed with a successful Grapple. This crocodile is more challenging than the one that first appeared in Magi of Hermes, page 11.''

''Virtue can be enriched to make a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm (Personal Power (Ward Against Faeries of the Desert)) or alternatively grants ability to see the future (Premonition and/or Visions). In some cultures it is the eyes of the crocotta grant similar powers. A charm made from the genitalia and anus grants the Venus’s Blessing Virtue to the wearer according to Persian sources.''

==Mongoose==

''The mongoose, or ichneumon, is the bane of all snakes. Egyptians encourage them to dwell in their houses and grain stores, for they are fearsome predators of mice and rats as well as all reptiles. Whenever they encounter an asp, their ferocity comes to the fore, and they leap into battle against the larger creature and attack''
''until it is dead. Pliny the Elder reports that the ichneumon rolls itself in mud that then dries to a stone-like consistency, protecting it against the fangs of the serpent. There is a type of mongoose called the enhydrus, which reserves its ferocity for crocodiles. It waits until the mighty creature falls asleep with its mouth open, and then crawls inside and starts to eat the crocodile from the inside outwards.''

==Monkeys==

''There are a number of different monkeys in the region described by this book, of which the most prominent is the baboon. All monkeys are group animals, and if threatened fight as a trained group in order to save themselves and each other. Only baboons attack using such strategies, and even use group fighting as a hunting strategy. Monkeys always give birth to twins, and the mother loves one (hugging it close to her chest) and neglects the other (making it ride on her back). However, when a predator threatens she discards the child she loves in order to climb to safety.''

==Ethiopian Pegasus==

''According to Pliny the Elder, one of the monstrosities found in “Ethiopia” was the Pegasus Aethiopicum. This creature was perhaps a descendent of the fabled Pegasus ridden by the ancient hero Bellerophon. That Pegasus was the child of Medusa and Poseidon, begotten illicitly in Athena’s Libyan temple where Medusa was a priestess, but not born until she was beheaded by Perseus. As Perseus flew to rescue Andromeda from the dragon Ceto (see Chapter 8: Ethiopia), further drops of blood flew out of Medusa’s head, and falling onto the sand they gave rise to more pegasi. The Ethiopian Pegasus is a winged horse, bearing a pair of long horns on its head. Apart from these distinctive un-horselike features, the beast should be considered to have the same statistics as a courser (see The Book of Mundane Beasts or Realms of Power: Magic, page 142); its horns have the following weapon statistics: Init +2, Atk +3, Def +2, Dam +3.''

==Ostrich==

''Ostriches are common in Nubia and Ethiopia, and a smaller variety can be found in North Africa, Egypt and Arabia. The statistics here reflect the larger African ostrich. Valued for their feathers, leather, and eggs, and less so for their meat, they roam the semi-arid plains in great flocks but avoid the deep desert. Ostrich hunting remains a favorite pastime''

Ostriches have a natural inclination to hide their heads in bushes as a response to any threats. However, they can be trained against this habit, and may be ridden as mounts by lightweight riders.''

==Serpent, Elephant-Eating==

''These immense serpents live in the ravines at the base of hills, and in deep caves that can take their bulk. When it is time for them to feed, they congregate at rivers where elephants are known to gather. Often, several serpents attack the same elephant, fighting as an untrained group; several can grapple at the same time, but only one can use the Constriction power. They are not averse to attacking other suitable prey. When attacking an elephant, the serpent attempts to lasso its victim’s legs in a knot of its tail and then suffocate it. If possible, a giant serpent attacks from ambush. It aims to subdue its prey as quickly as possible. It expends a Fatigue level on its initial bite attack, and again in its next action''

Once the serpent has successfully grappled an opponent (and begun constricting), on subsequent rounds it can continue constricting and still attack with its bite. These attacks may be directed at the grappled victim (in which case the Grapple Strength adds to the Attack Total), or at another opponent. The serpent can usually only constrict a single creature at a time. Swallow Whole (non-magical): The serpent can swallow whole any creature of Size –1 or smaller. If the creature has not first been subdued with a Constriction attack (see above) it can struggle to escape, but it continues to be affected by constriction while swallowed. It is impossible to breathe inside the serpent, requiring deprivation rolls (ArM5, page 180) even if the victim escapes the grapple. Three rounds after being swallowed, the victim reaches the stomach. The powerful acids inflict +9 damage every round, complete immersion quadruples this to +36''
''(ArM5, page 181). A character may be able to brace himself and avoid complete immersion: make a Strength + Athletics roll each round; Ease Factor 6 results in only half immersion (triple damage), Ease Factor 9 results in immersion of a limb (double damage), and Ease Factor 12 means just a splash (normal damage). The serpent cannot swallow a second creature until the previous one has reached the stomach. Appearance: A snake over 45 feet long, with a diameter of nearly two feet at its thickest point. They are mostly mottled brown in coloration, but have patches and swirls of olive green, black, and yellow.''
''These giant elephant eating snakes are capable of swallowing creatures up to Size +5, but it takes hours to accomplish this, gradually inching its articulated jaws around the dead creature’s body. The Swallow Whole power represents its ability to swallow smaller prey items alive. The serpents automatically win Initiative and receive a +3 to Attack totals on the first round of combat if they take their victim by surprise. They have a +3 to all Stealth rolls when they are remaining still, and a +3 to all Perception rolls involving their sense of smell.''
