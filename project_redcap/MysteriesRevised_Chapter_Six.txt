''From the earliest ages, man has sought wisdom in the stars and wondered what influence the planets have in shaping events on Earth. The most famous astrologers of the past were the Chaldeans, and Babylonian astrological lore was considered the epitome of the science. Astrologers point to the action of the tides and the turning of the seasons, which are clearly linked to astronomical phenomena, as proof of their science’s validity.''
''The Romans became great enthusiasts for astrology, which came to rival and ultimately supersede many earlier forms of divination owing to its claims to scientific precision; it was used both to predict the future and to find the best time for certain types of activity, and soon became an intrinsic part of many magical operations, as well as being much resorted to by private citizens. The influence of the stars encouraged fatalism, the belief that a person’s destiny was written in the stars, and that his own actions were unable to confound his eternal fate. Philosophies that encouraged courage and resignation in the face of this inevitability grew fashionable in the Roman Empire.''
''The Church fathers attacked astrology for three basic reasons. First, its practice bears traces of pagan superstition and star worship. Second, it denies the fundamental Christian principle of free will. If the stars control all human action, people are not responsible for their good or evil deeds, and the hope of salvation is meaningless. Third, astrology exposes the stargazer to the operation of hostile spirits.''
''St. Augustine makes the strongest assault on astrology. In City of God he brings together a number of ancient arguments''
''against astrology and underscores the science’s incompatibility with Christian beliefs. His sentiments are familiar to any scholar who studies the stars. Augustine decries the lack of accountability in a world where God rules the stars and the stars rule humanity. “How is any room left for God to pass judgment on the deeds of men,” he writes, “if they are subject to astrological forces, and God is Lord both of stars and men?” Further, the responsibility for human evil rests upon humanity itself and not upon God. Astrologers blaspheme by claiming God and the stars, as his agents, are the sources of human wickedness.''
''Most Christian philosophers, nevertheless, accept astrology’s place in medicine and science, following the famous motto, “The wise one will rule the stars.” Astral influence, they argue, can be overcome by the strength of will. Learning astrology, in other words, helps to defeat astrology.''
''Many astrologers are simply indifferent to their theological critics, and do not bother to refute what they see as irrelevant.''
''Scientific astrology was rare in Europe before the 12th century, but popular astrology, based on phases of the moon, was known from an early stage. This form of astrology used charts showing which days in the lunar cycle were good or bad for various activities. Scientific astrology, involving the drawing-up of charts and detailed examination of planetary influences was, however, practiced extensively by many magicians, and by court astrologers who were gaining influence all over Europe, often to the dismay of the other courtiers. A clever man could gain by this means an influence usually reserved''
''for powerful nobles and trusted retainers, and even barons often maintained a personal astrologer, while merchants frequently consulted with the astrologers and soothsayers who practiced in the growing towns and cities.''
''Astronomy is taught in the universities as part of the liberal arts, and so astrology could be included as part of the curriculum in this way. Regarding the influx of Arabic learning, Abu Ma’shar’s Greater Introduction to Astrology was translated into Latin in 1133, and Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos in 1138. One of the most popular works is the Centiloquium, a collection of aphorisms falsely ascribed to Ptolemy. Ulius Firmicus Maternus’ writings on astrology are also used extensively. Frederick II had his children’s horoscopes cast, and Michael Scot gave astrological advice to the king when he entered his service.''
''It was also considered that the influences of the heavens could also be artificially drawn down and utilized through the use of periapts — amulets inscribed with the names and sigils of the stars and planets. A very small minority of writers claimed this process worked merely through natural magic. One of the standard Arabic texts for this process was that of Thabit ibn Qurra (836-901) and his formula for ridding a place of scorpions. The best known work of astral magic is the Picatrix, translated into Spanish and Latin under Alfonso the Wise. In addition to the use of astrological talismans, including images, to achieve various effects, it also includes sections on substances with magical properties, and how to pray to the planets.''
''Astrology is seen as a reputable science in Mythic Europe, and while churchmen do, from time to time, denounce it,''

=Hermetic Astrology=

''it is generally considered acceptable and is tolerated, and indeed can be considered a mainstream form of learning and discourse.''
''While astrology is known throughout Mythic Europe, Hermetic Astrology deals with working the influence of the heavens, as they manifest on Earth, into Hermetic magic. Many systems of magic contain ways of dealing with the astral influences, but Hermetic magic is able to ignore them owing to Bonisagus’s breakthroughs. Astrological Mystery Cults often teach a Magical Focus or Potent Magic relating to their interests in Divination, covering various aspects of Intellego magics. Divination by astrology is dealt with in Chapter 7: Divination and Augury. The most basic principle of Hermetic Astrology is Planetary Magic, which is known throughout the Order and discussed in Chapter 4: Curious Common Magics.''
''The Ability Artes Liberales (Astronomy) is often simply abbreviated Astronomy, and is a key ability for the success of astrological magics.''
''Astrological correspondences, and the meanings of signs, planets, and houses, are explained in an appendix to this chapter.''

==Periapt — Minor Mystery Virtue==

''A periapt was originally a small amulet with astrological symbols, which contained a simple one-use enchantment; Hermetic theory has allowed magi to generalize this to make astrological amulets as any form of Hermetic charged device.''
''By creating a special Horoscope for the season, the magus is able to infer the correct aspects of the heavens to create amulets with greater efficiency than normal: the charges resulting equal those that the magus would produce if he already had a Lab Text for the enchantment.''

===Creating a Periapt===

''A magus with this Virtue may create a Periapt Horoscope for a proposed activity, and use this as a temporary, single-use''
''Lab Text for creating charged devices (ArM5, page 102). The magus must have a Lab Total that equals or exceeds the level of the proposed enchantment. In addition, the Effect level instilled using a Periapt Horoscope is limited to the enchanter’s Artes Liberales (Astronomy) times 5.''

===Number of Charges = Lab Total / 5===


===(rounded Up)===


===Maximum Effect Level = 5 X Artes===


===Liberales (Astronomy) Score===

''A magus may work on several periapts that share a single Technique and Form. A separate Horoscope is needed for each formula he wishes to enchant.''

===Creating a Periapt Horoscope===

''The Horoscope is prepared at the start of the season, on the day of the equinox or solstice. This takes one hour, and applies to that season only. To create the Periapt Horoscope, roll:''

===Stress Die + Intelligence + Astronomy===


===Vs. an Ease Factor of 9===

''If the roll fails, the magus knows that the Horoscope is faulty, and may consider a different activity instead of this enchantment. If the roll botches, the magus doesn’t realize the Horoscope is faulty and attempts faulty alignments: the entire season is wasted. If a magus works on multiple periapts, then a botch on any of the Horoscope rolls spoils the whole season.''

==Celestial Magic — Major Mystery Virtue==

''The astrologer uses his great knowledge of the movements of the heavens to determine the most effective times to perform magical operations in the lab, by calculating the best hours and periods to work, by modifying incantations, and by instilling astral influences from the ruling''
''signs, planets, and houses into his work to gain the greatest possible effect.''
''This Virtue includes and replaces the benefits of Planetary Magic, which is a required prerequisite. The benefits of Celestial Magic include:''
''Widens the scope of Laboratory Horoscopes (from Planetary Magic) New celestial Durations Determine a favorable hour of the day for spellcasting Creating astrologically linked enchantments''
''An Initiate sacrifices Planetary Magic in order to gain Celestial Magic, which counts as an Ordeal (Loss of a Virtue) for the Initiation.''

===Improved Laboratory Horoscopes===

''The magus may create a Laboratory Horoscope just as for Planetary Magic, but now may apply the bonus to any Laboratory activity. The magus maximizes the benign influences of the stars and planets by working at the correct times, and minimizes unfavorable aspects by avoiding certain associations or hours.''
''Decide in advance on an Astrological Modifier to the Lab Total, from +1 to +5. To gain this bonus, the magus must succeed in a roll of:''

===Stress Die + Intelligence + Astronomy===


===Vs. Three Times the Desired Bonus===

''If successful, add the Astrological Modifier to his Lab Total. If the roll fails, there is no effect other than losing the bonus; it is not possible to reroll this season. On a roll of zero, roll a number of botch dice equal to the desired bonus; any botch results in the entire season being wasted, as well as any vis expended in the project.''
''Example: Astra has Intelligence +3 and an Astronomy score of 6. She would like to improve her laboratory work in the coming season, and considers casting a Laboratory Horoscope for her work. She decides that she would like a bonus of +4 in her work, so the Ease Factor for her proposed Horoscope is 12. Her player rolls 7+3+6 = 16,''
''•''
''• •''
''•''
''succeeding easily. She adds 4 to her Lab Total this season.''
''Horoscope Bonus: When opening an invested device, subtract the Laboratory Horoscope bonus for the opening season from the number of pawns of vis required to open the device (minimum of one pawn). This does not reduce the number of enchantment spaces available. Distractions: As with Planetary Magic, if a maga commits her lab work to astrologically favorable hours, and then loses time from the laboratory and attempts to catch up by working harder for the rest of the season, she is forced to include work at unfavorable hours as well as favorable hours. Because of this, she loses the benefit of the Astrological Modifier if she is ever forced to miss a whole day away from the laboratory. Other than this, distractions are as stated on ArM5, page 103.''

===Astrological Durations===

''The astrologer can link spell duration to the rising and setting of constellations, and the times when the constellations and sun coincide. Although the true constellations and zodiacal signs vary in length along the zodiacal band, for convenience, astrologers assume that all signs have equal size.''
''An Astrological Minute for spells is the same as a Hermetic Diameter Duration — the time for the sun to move across its own diameter. Hermetic magic does not distinguish between the length of these two periods.''
''An Astrological Hour is the time for a sign (its constellation) to move from rising to centered over horizon, or centered to fully risen (12 signs, 24 hours per day).''
''An Astrological Day is marked by the sun returning to the same constellation. This is almost exactly one day of 24 hours.''
''An Astrological Sign (“month”) is marked by the sunrise moving through one full constellation. Assume a calendar month rather than calculating exact periods.''
''Using Astrological Durations requires a roll of Astronomy. Having aids or desiring extra precision can modify the basic Astronomy roll. The roll normally uses a''
''Stress Die, but the magus can take extra time and measurements and make a nonstress roll.''

===New Duration: Minutes = Diameter===

''The magus can have a spell last a certain number of Astrological Minutes then end. To calculate the duration correctly, he must succeed in a roll of:''

===Die Roll + Intelligence + Astronomy Vs.===


===6 + Number of Diameters Desired===


===New Duration: Hours = Sun===

''The maga can have a spell last a certain number of Astrological Hours then end (regardless of sunrise/sunset). To calculate the duration correctly, she must succeed in a roll of:''

===Die Roll + Intelligence + Astronomy Vs.===


===6 + Number of Hours Desired===


===New Duration: Days = Moon===

''The magus can have a spell last a number of Astrological Days then end (regardless of lunar phase). To calculate the duration correctly, he must succeed in a roll of:''

===Die Roll + Intelligence + Astronomy Vs.===


===6 + Number of Days Desired===


===New Duration: Signs = Year, Ritual===

''The maga can have a spell last a number of Astrological Signs. To calculate the duration correctly, she must succeed in a roll of:''

===Die Roll + Intelligence + Astronomy Vs.===


===6 + Number of Months Desired===

''The maximum duration is one year, regardless of all other factors.''
''If the magus fails the Astronomy roll to calculate an Astrological Duration, he has miscalculated, and the actual length of the spell effect is out by a number of time units up to the error in the roll. (This is a storyguide decision, as the magus won’t know until spell ends.) Botching the Duration calculation makes the spell botch.''
''Example: Erratus wishes a spell to last ten Hours, with an Ease Factor of 16, but only rolls 11. The actual spell effect lasts anywhere from five to 15 Hours, as determined by the storyguide.''

===Favorable Hour for Spellcasting===

''The maga can attempt to identify an hour of the day that will be favorable to her and her intentions and gain an Astrological bonus to spells cast during''

[|
''Astrological time varies from place to place, as the sun, stars, and heavens shine differently everywhere. Beyond modest limits, neither Daily Horoscopes nor astrological times can be applied consistently. However, the steady increment in time as the day progresses in a single place is a natural part of astrological calculations and is already included in calculations: a Daily Horoscope lasts for one day in the place it is calculated for.''
''For the purpose of Hermetic spells, conditions are essentially identical over an area extending approximately 500 paces in all directions from the point of measurement (an area approximately''
''100 standard Boundaries, or a Size of Boundary +2 magnitudes). A magus cannot increase the area of measurement, as it is the heavens’ own movements that bring about the limit.''
''This limits, for example, the spread of a Group Target (all members must be within 500 paces of the measurement point), and the Size of any Target (which must fit within the measurement radius). If a Hermetic Target spreads further than the measurement allows, then no spell or effect using Astrological Time can affect that Target. (The target may move out of the area once the spell has been cast.)''

==Limits on the Use of Astrological Time==


|]
''that hour. Only one hour in any day will favor the maga.''
''The maga must create a spellcasting Horoscope for herself, which takes one hour. Decide in advance on the Astrological Modifier you desire as a spellcasting bonus, from +1 to +5. To gain this bonus, you must succeed in a roll of''

===Stress Die + Intelligence + Astronomy===


===Vs. Three Times Desired Bonus===

''If successful, add the bonus to the casting scores of spells cast during the favorable hour.''
''The maga will not know the success of this until the hour begins (so you may choose to delay the roll until then). If the roll fails, the calculation was wrong and the influences invoked are of no benefit. If the roll botches, the maga determined the wrong factors and suffers a penalty equal to the intended bonus for the whole hour.''

===Astrologically Linked Enchantments===

''A maga may create enchantments that are astrologically linked to a particular target or time of the year.''
''Astrological link to a Target: Linking an enchantment to a single target requires a Nativity Horoscope for the target, and may also use an Arcane Connection if available. The enchantment is automatically restricted to acting on the single target, without the usual +3 Effect level cost for restricting Effect use, this is part of the astrological link.''
''The maga gains a bonus to her Lab Total for this effect. To calculate the bonus, add the bonus for a Nativity Horoscope (+2) and if she has an Arcane Connection, consult the Arcane Connection Bonus table on ArM5, page 84, and add the multiplier bonus.''
''Example: Notara wants to enchant her talisman to help make herself fly. Her talisman counts as an Indefinite Duration AC (bonus +4), and she has previously calculated her own Nativity Horoscope (bonus +2). She applies a bonus of +6 to her Lab Total. The effect is automatically limited to Notara only (at no cost to the Effect level).''
''Seasonal Enchantments: It is possible to create a device that is attuned to a particular astrological cycle: either one particular sign, such as Leo, or to a group of signs associated with one of the four elements.''

[|
''Option: Calculate a Daily Horoscope. As described in ArM5, page 84, this requires an Intelligence + Astronomy roll vs. an Ease Factor of 9, taking one hour to complete. Having a Daily Horoscope for the target location subtracts 3 from the Ease Factor of Astronomy rolls for duration calculation. The Horoscope is valid for spells cast over the course of that day, but only for the area it was created for (see Limits on the Use of Astrological Time for distance limits imposed by astrological time).''
''If the the roll fails, the magus realizes this and may ignore the Horoscope.;If the roll botches, the magus doesn’t realize until he uses the Horoscope in a spell, and that spell botches because of the miscalculation.''
''Option: Measure the exact astrological time. Using a spell such as Sight of the Astrological Hour subtracts 3 from the Ease Factor to calculate an Astrological Duration.''
''Option: Precision astrology. The maga can choose to specify exactly when the spell will end, to the nearest Astrological Minute (even up to months away). Precision astrology adds 3 to the Ease Factor of the roll to calculate the exact duration. She must also either calculate a Daily Horoscope for the day of the planned end of the spell, or consult a magical armillary sphere. The effect is largely cosmetic, but can be quite striking!''
''Option: Consult a magical armillary sphere. The calculations for Astrological Durations are complex and easy to mistake, requiring the magus to''
''juggle factors for both the current astrological time and the time when the spell will end. An enchanted armillary sphere (see below for description and construction) can be created that will adjust itself to show astrological time now and at the end of the spell, for both the caster and (the location of) the target of a spell, which greatly eases the calculations.''
''The Ease Factor of the Astrological Duration Astronomy roll is halved. The halving is done after all additions to and subtractions from the Ease Factor.''
''Option: Non-stress calculations. The magus must know the exact astrological time (see Sight of the Astrological Hour) and have already calculated a suitable Daily Horoscope or consult a magical armillary sphere. He needs to check his calculations by making observations of the changing conditions over the course of a full Diameter, that is two minutes.''
''If he does this, then although he may still make errors in the calculation, you can use a simple die and avoid disasters.''

''Options: Calculating an Astrological Duration The Time of the Favorable Hour''

[|
''Rather than consult genuine astrological tables to determine when a favorable hour would arise, the storyguide may use the following simple process: roll a simple die read as 0-9 and multiply by 10, and add another simple die (a number from 1 to 100), then divide by 4 (round up). Reroll results of 25 (or choose a number to suit). The hours of the day are most easily counted from midnight to midnight. If the hour indicated has already passed, then either the magus has missed the opportunity, or this indicates an hour after the next midnight.''

|]
''Elements form opposed pairs: fire vs. water and air vs. earth. If the maga applies a bonus in one element’s signs, the device receives an equal penalty in the opposing element’s signs.''
''The astrological cycle adjustment is the maga’s Artes Liberales (Astronomy) score at the time she opens the device for enchantment (or creates it, for lesser devices or charged items). The whole device has a single astrological cycle, governing all effects in the device, but the particular adjustment is chosen when the maga instills an Effect:''
''Penetration Bonus: Add the bonus or penalty to the Penetration score of the Effect. Frequency Bonus: Add (or subtract) the astrological cycle bonus or penalty (round up) to the Effect levels used in the Effect Frequency table, and note the adjusted uses per day. If this takes the frequency levels below 0 (one use per day), the effect cannot be used while the adjustment applies. There is no benefit to increasing the frequency above ten levels (Unlimited uses).''
''Astrologically enchanted devices are by their nature more potent, but tend to be limited by astrological factors.''
''Example: Notara creates a wand of Pilum of Fire. She attunes the wand to the cycle of elemental signs, and chooses the fire signs as the device’s cycle. Her Artes Liberales (Astronomy) score is 7, so during the signs of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, the wand has a +7 bonus, but during water signs (Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces), the wand has a –7 penalty.''
''Notara must choose whether the Pilum of Fire effect has a cyclic penetration or cycle use level. She chooses use level, and enchants the effect with a basic +3 levels for six uses per day. During the fire signs, this counts as +10 levels, or Unlimited use, but during water signs the wand is unusable. For the other half of the year, she may use it six times per day.''

===Spells To Determine Astrological Time===

''These spells do not require Astrological Virtues to learn or cast, but''

===•===


===•===

''the information is most useful to magi using Astrological Durations.''
''To cast a spell relying on a measured astrological time it is sufficient to measure the astrological time near the target, provided the measurement point and the target of subsequent spells are close enough. As such, these measurement spells are normally indirect and Aimed rather than Targeted (see ArM5, page 86).''
''New Intellego Vim Guidelines Level 5: Discern and measure a single''
''astrological factor in the environment. Discern and measure the astrological time in the environment. (The caster is learning the conditions at the target location, not at his own locale, so usually extend range.) Level 10: Discern and measure all astro''
''logical factors in the environment. This provides sufficient information to reset a magical armillary sphere to the conditions in a different environment.''

===Sense the Hour===

''InVi 10 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Measures the astrological time in the area around the magus. Knowing the hour exactly subtracts 3 from the Ease Factor of the Astronomy roll for an Astrological Duration spell.''
''Measuring the conditions at a single point is sufficient, as identical conditions (suitable for Astrological Durations) extend for some 500 paces away from the point (standard Boundary area x 100). Increasing the size of the spell Target serves no purpose, as the measurement area is limited by changes in the astrological conditions, rather than by the magus’s spell.''
''(Base 5, +1 Touch)''

===Sight of the Astrological Hour===

''InVi 20 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind Measures the astrological time in the area around a point the caster can see.''
''(Base 5, +3 Sight)''

===Divine Heaven’s Aspect===

''InVi 30 R: Arcane, D: Mom, T: Ind Reports all aspects of the astrological conditions (minute, hour, day, sign, planets) at a point that the caster can see, or to which he has an Arcane Connection. Identical conditions extend for some 500 paces away from this point (100 standard Boundaries).''
''(Base 10, +4 Arcane)''

==New Enchanted Device: Magical Armillary Sphere==

''An armillary sphere is a complex mechanical device that indicates time and the movements of the planets and stars. By making an accurate armillary sphere and marking it accurately with astrological signs, the maga can set the wheels to any configuration of the heavens, and read off from the wheels and dials the configuration of the heavens at an earlier or later time. The prediction of astrological conjunctions at times in the future is possible because the wheels of the heavens continue to cycle indefinitely and precisely. (The armillary sphere does not predict or break the Hermetic Limit of Time, it just mechanizes the calculations of the astrologer.)''
''By linking an enchantment moving the circles with a Know the Heavens effect, the magus obtains a device that both reports the current astrological conditions and translates between those and some other time. This is of some limited use in Horoscopes, which are mostly a matter of interpretation, but greatly assists in calculating and working with Astrological Durations.''

===Making an Armillary Sphere===

''A magical armillary sphere requires an actual functioning armillary sphere of considerable accuracy that is then animated by the invested effects. Making such an armillary sphere requires a precision physical mechanism: its markings must be''
''exact for the astrologer to be able to read it accurately (and safely use it in magic). The interplay of cycles and the precision markings makes the mechanism difficult to construct:''
''Firstly, it is necessary to design the armillary sphere to work on astrological principles. The designer (the magus) must succeed in a roll of:''

===Stress Die + Intelligence + Astronomy===


===Vs. an Ease Factor of 12===

''or the design itself is flawed. Then the magus must make his armillary sphere. This requires the magus crafting the device to succeed in a roll of:''

===Stress Die + Dexterity + Craft (Mechanisms Or Clocks) Vs. an Ease===


===Factor of 12===

''or the mechanism is faulty. He can use Craft (Blacksmith) instead of Craft (Mechanisms), but with –3 to the roll and +3 botch dice. The astronomer can employ another as the craftsman to make the mechanism, but must then supervise''
''him throughout the construction, offering advice and corrections throughout. This adds +3 to both design and craft Ease Factors.''

===Astronomy Vs. an Ease Factor of 15===


===Craft an Armillary Sphere Designed By Another: Stress Die + Dexterity + Craft===


===Mechanisms Vs. an Ease Factor of 15===

''The Ease Factors are reduced by 3 if copying an existing precision armillary sphere.''
''It takes a full season of mundane work to make an armillary sphere, during which the astrologer needs to test, diagnose, and determine adjustments to the growing mechanism, correcting anything that causes the alignment to slip. It takes a great deal of time because of a need to keep repeating astrological measurements as the heavens move and then rework parts of the mechanism.''
''If the astrologer is not the craftsman but only testing a mechanism he''
''designed, he may perform other activities — it is effectively a seven-day distraction.''

===Magical Duplication===

''Crafting a precision armillary sphere is sufficiently complex and time-consuming that many magi turn to magic to create one. An easy way to obtain a ready-built (mundane) mechanism is to magically duplicate an existing one.''

===Duplicate the Mechanism===

''Cr(In)Te 35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group, Ritual This spell creates an exact duplicate of an existing mechanism. An armillary sphere itself is complex and fiddly, but nonmagical. The precision of the mechanism is limited by the precision of the duplicated source.''
''Status-conscious magi may prefer the alternative Level 45 ritual Duplicate the Noble Mechanism, which creates a precious metal (silver or gold, or both) mechanism.''
''(Base 5 create metal, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +2 for finesse, +1 for Intellego requisite).''
''A similar spell without an Intellego requisite, Craft the Mechanism, can create a new mechanism, but is limited by the magus’s understanding of what he is creating and requires Finesse to match design to instant magic.''

===Craft the Mechanism===

''Cr(In)Te 35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group, Ritual To make an armillary sphere with Craft the Mechanism, the magus must design the device with an Intelligence + Astronomy or appropriate Craft Ability roll:''

===Stress Die + Intelligence + Astronomy Or Craft (Mechanisms Or Clocks) Vs. an===


===Ease Factor of 18===

''and then must guide the magic to the correct crafted form: Stress Die + Perception + Finesse vs. an Ease Factor of 18''
''If either roll fails, then mechanism is flawed and imprecise; if either roll botch''

''An armillary sphere, or spherical astrolabe, is a model of the celestial sphere, centered on the Earth. Its name come from armilla, a bracelet or circle, which is to say that its form is that of metal circles (graduated to mark signs and degrees) linking the celestial poles, equator, meridians, and parallels, and the circle of the Zodiac (also known as the ecliptic). The armillary sphere was devised by Eratosthenes in antiquity, and is mentioned in the writings of Ptolemy and other great authors on astronomy and astrology. The device indicates the motion of the stars around the Earth, and can be extended to show the planets.''
''For the practical-minded magus, the wonder of this device is that it may be adjusted to display any configuration of the heavens, and readings made from the graduated circles are available for astrological calculations. An enchanted armillary sphere can be made that con''
''tinually adjusts itself as the heavens shift, yet can be adjusted to indicate the heavens at any time past or present.''
''The planar astrolabe, or simply astrolabe, is a related device that collapses the design into a series of flat disks and has sights to measure the position of stars. It is used by navigators and astrologers alike to measure the stars. It is less suited to the special purposes of celestial magic than the armillary sphere; however, as a measuring device, the astrolabe is favored in Divination (Astrology).''

===Enchanting the Armillary Sphere===

''Once the mechanism is crafted, it is ready to be enchanted. The mechanism must be opened as an invested device, needing 15 pawns (base metal, x3 for skull sized), or 18 if constructed of silver, 30 for gold.''
''Two effects are now needed:''

===Know the Heavens===

''InVi 29 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Always on, T: Ind''
''The armillary sphere continually senses the astrological time and the influence of the planets around itself.''

''(Base 2, +2 metal, +2 group, +1 complexity, +10 levels unlimited uses, +3 levels linked to Know the Heavens)''
''The two effects combined consume seven spaces and seven pawns of vis, leaving spaces for other enchantments should the magus wish.''

===Consulting the Armillary Sphere===

''Consulting the armillary sphere before casting an Astrological Duration spell mechanizes the difficult calculations needed, providing instant access to current and predicted conditions as the magus juggles the conjunctions in his head and works the spell. This halves the Ease Factor of Astrological Duration calculations.''
''The magus can use the armillary sphere without adjustment if the target location shares the magus’s astrological time (all of the intended spell target is within 500 paces of the instrument). To use the magical armillary sphere for calculations based on a more distant location, he must know the conditions there (for example, through casting Divine''
''Heaven’s Aspect), and make an Intelligence + Astronomy roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to adjust the armillary sphere settings.''

''This takes but a single round; if the roll is failed, the magus may try again (if it’s botched, the spell botches too). When the magus finishes his readings and releases the armillary sphere adjustment wheels, the enchantments adjust the settings back to local time. Further readings require another spell and more adjustment.''

==The Magoi of the Star==

''Wise astrologers who see in their arts a means of defeating the destiny of the stars and practicing God-given free will.''

==The History of the Magoi of the Star==

''Since ancient Rome, scholars have argued about whether the influence of the planets is compatible with human free will. If the stars dictate our every action, and the astrologer can tell the course of a man’s life just by looking at his Nativity Horoscope, are we not bound by their influence? Can one punish a criminal when his actions were dictated by the planets at the time of his birth? Does the ability to foretell the future mean that our eventual salvation or damnation is already established?''
''The Magoi say no; they believe that Christian principles of free will are completely compatible with the influence of the stars, which are influences, not determinants. A man born under a well-aspected Mars may well be a great warrior; yet if he chooses to ignore the call to arms and become a farmer, the stars cannot make him a soldier. The Limit of Time is a''
''Divine limit according to these theorists, and only God can have true knowledge of the future. The stars dictate general patterns, and forces that act upon men, but do not actually force them to make certain decisions; the Magoi rigorously refute astral determinism and the resulting heresy of fatalism, where a man has no control over his destiny. Did not God who made humanity with the divine gift of free will not also set the stars in the sky? To assert that astrology is incompatible with free will is clearly nonsensical.''
''The Magoi are heavily influenced by the thinking of Origen, a theologian and biblical scholar of the early Church. During the persecution under Emperor Trajan Decius (250 AD), Origen was imprisoned and tortured but survived to die several years later. His tomb at Tyre is held in honor by the local church to this day and is a site of great importance to the Magoi of the Star, yet even more important to their minds are the relics of the three Persian magi in Cologne.''
''The Magoi of the Star hold that despite the fact the influence of the planets cannot directly dictate one’s future, their influence is still felt and strong. Many human weaknesses and mistakes result from the baleful influence of the planets, which cloud one’s reason and cause unfortunate choices. Only by understanding what the influences are, and by acting in full knowledge of their impact, can one truly exercise free will and reason and be freed completely from the dictates of the planets. Therefore they take an ironic''
''stance: They learn astrology so as to be able to use its secrets to counteract negative influences and make themselves free of the objects astrologers study.''
''They claim to be descended from the magi of the Bible who brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant Jesus, having followed a bright star. Avowedly Christian, they pay particular reverence to the Three Wise Men, Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, whose bodies lie in The Shrine of Kings at Cologne Cathedral, having been brought there from Milan in 1164 by Frederick I, and having originally been discovered by the Empress Helena on her pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The secrets of the magi of the Bible were those of the astrological sciences, and some say the Magoi of the Star are awaiting the Second Coming, and pay particular attention to the prophecy of the end times given in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation. They''
''are not holy magi, however, and many of their beliefs would be looked upon with deep suspicion by orthodox churchmen, as incompatible with the wisdom of the great Augustine.''

==The Magoi of the Star Today==

''The Magoi of the Star are the Order of Hermes’ greatest astrologers and experts on matters pertaining to astrological magic. While the group is loosely organized, every member is expected to make the pilgrimage to Cologne Cathedral at least once to celebrate Christmas Day, and many also brave the journey to Bethlehem. The cult’s festival is Christmas Day, December 25th, and individual members also celebrate their own birthdays with elaborate rites — both occasions are marked by lavish gift-giving to fellow Magoi of the Star. The cult has recently become concerned with prophecies of an Antichrist, and is fervently searching for information as to the veracity and meaning of these portents. Their divination and astrology allow an understanding of the present, but do not let them see into the future, and even the wisest diviner must know the right questions to ask.''

==Structure of the Magoi of the Star==

''The cult teaches its secrets by direct transmission from master to pupil, with little structure beyond the teacher-student relationship. When the master believes the pupil is ready, the pupil is Initiated to another secret. When a master decides a pupil has learned enough, the pupil goes forth to become a master. The group is rumored to have cult headquarters (in Bethlehem, Babylon, Cologne, and possibly other places besides) that contain great repositories of astrological lore and ancient magical books, but the truth of this is a closely guarded cult secret.''
''The cult is organized into seven separate degrees of Initiation.''

===Degree of Saturn===

''This is the first degree of Initiation, and members traditionally wear black gowns, emblazoned with stars and moon symbols for rites. To be Initiated requires a knowledge of Artes Liberales at 4 or greater, reflecting a sound knowledge of astronomy and the mathematical ability to construct astrological charts. The Initiate is taught how to overcome planetary influences, and how to use them to his advantage. The Virtue Initiated is Planetary Magic.''

===Degree of Jupiter===

''The second degree grants the Initiate the Minor Virtue Potent Magic in her own birth house (Chapter 6: Appendix — Astrological Correspondences, and Chapter 4: Curious Common Magics, Modified Hermetic Virtues and Flaws: Astrological Magical Foci and Potent Magic), as the Initiate learns how to use her knowledge of the astral influences to even greater effect. The robes for this degree are emblazoned with astrological symbols and are often a deep blue color.''

===Degree of Mars===

''The Initiate, resplendent in robes of red, is now required to actively serve the cult by watching for signs of the infernal, and by actively opposing the schemes of diabolists and other infernalists. As his knowledge deepens, the Initiate learns the Virtue Periapts. He is often taught the ability Medicine for a season, as he learns more about the four humors.''

===Degree of Venus===

''Wearing a copper circlet and an emerald robe, the Initiate is now responsible for actively working to gather information in line with the cult’s current interests, and must participate in the pilgrimage to Cologne for Christmas Day if she has not before now. The Initiate is taught the secrets of astrology now, namely the Major Virtue Celestial Magic.''

===Degree of Mercury===

''This degree requires the Initiate begin to teach on behalf on the cult, and to train new Initiates in the mystery. It is the degree where the Initiate also travels most, to Cologne, Bethlehem, and Babylon, seeking out astrological secrets and meeting with other leading astrologers, both from the Magoi of the Star and from other traditions. He is taught the Virtue Major Magical Focus, relating to''

==Doctrine of Origen==

''For Origen, there is no damnation of Hell; all things will eventually be saved and join God, in what is known as the Perfectibility of Man, a heretical doctrine. Evil is the result of the soul’s free will, not the result of matter. In fact, for Origen, the soul pre-exists birth, and it makes an evil choice of its own to be put into a body in the first place. The embodiment of souls is therefore a kind of fall from grace. Origen opposed the idea that a person’s entire life could be determined from a horoscope.''
''To admit the truth of horoscopes annihilates free will. According to Origen, the stars and planets are living, rational beings comprised of both matter and spirit. The stars possess free will and glow because they are filled with knowledge from the reflection of the everlasting light of God’s wisdom. The stars are even capable of sin. Origen interpreted a passage in Deuteronomy to mean that the stars have in general been assigned by God to all the nations beneath Heaven. He admits that the stars foretell many things, and puts special faith in comets as omens. Origen holds that the stars are merely signs instituted by God, not causes of the future. Divine foreknowledge does not impose necessity, and the wise individual is able to overcome the power of the stars’ influence on the Earth.''
''Despite his theological confusion on the issue of Hell, Origen is still greatly admired by the Church.''

''the Initiate’s Potent house (as taught in the Degree of Jupiter), unless he already has a Magical Focus, in which case he may be taught Potent Magic for his birth planet or sign. The robes for this degree are of orange or amber.''

===Wise One===

''Now considered a leading member of the cult, the true secrets of the cult philosophy and activities are finally revealed in full. Wearing a robe of silver bearing the symbol of the New Moon, this degree confers some of the great secrets of astrology on the Initiate, and she is taught the secrets of the Major Virtue Divination and Augury: Astrology (see Chapter 7).''

===The Hierophants===

''The greatest astrologers of all, the three Hierophants who lead the Magoi of the Star are said to know many Virtues concerning Astrological magic, and be able to Initiate a large number of astrological Virtues on those who attain this position of cult leadership. The three current Hierophants’ true identities are mysterious, and only when one of them dies or passes into Final Twilight will a new opening become available.''

==Appendix: Astrological Correspondences==

''The 12 great constellations (the signs of the Zodiac) and the seven planets revolve around the Earth in a complex sequence. (The magical armillary sphere, detailed earlier, can be used to track this sequence, and by the use of cunning mechanisms mimic here below the great engine of the heavens above.) Astrology studies the influence of the signs and the planets, and the complex calculations and charts known as a horoscope describe how''
''the heavens influence a person, place, or event.''
''As described in ArM5, page 84, a magus can calculate a Daily Horoscope for a person, if he knows the person’s location, by succeeding in an Intelligence + Artes Liberales (Astronomy) roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Creating a Daily Horoscope takes one hour. A magus can create a Nativity Horoscope if he knows the target’s time and place of birth, and succeeds in an''
''Intelligence + Artes Liberales (Astronomy) roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Creating a Nativity Horoscope takes a day’s work. Note: Most magi are careful to conceal and disguise information about their birth.''

''The 12 signs of the Zodiac govern the world below, influencing different aspects of the world. Each sign is also divided into three sub-periods called decans, revealing different aspects of the signs’ influence as the sun passed through each house:''

===The 12 Astrological Houses===

''At any time and place, one sign will be rising over the horizon in the east. The sign is known as the ascendant, and is the starting point of the horoscope. In the horoscope chart, the circle of the Zodiac is mapped into a circle of 12 divisions (known as houses) starting with the ascendant sign, and the remaining signs placed in the remaining houses in counter-clockwise order. Different signs reside in the houses depending on the time and place of the horoscope. The house a sign resides in influences how the sign influences the world. The 12 houses have their own influences, or provinces, as shown.''
