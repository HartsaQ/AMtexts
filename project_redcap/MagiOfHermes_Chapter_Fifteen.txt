''Concept: A traveling bard, whose magic enhances his music and makes his journeys easier, even as he’s plagued by a meddlesome faerie.''
''Yestin Ap Llewelyn of Jerbiton is an impressionable dreamer, an idealist always believing that something more adventurous lies just beyond his grasp. He travels widely and takes his music and magic all across Europe. He is a naturally upbeat man who enjoys the company of others. Feeling equally honored to play for prince, magus, or peasant alike, he is sure to strike up friendships wherever he goes. It may have been these qualities that drew the faerie spirit Taliesin to him, and it is certainly these qualities that Taliesin exploits to his own ends. Under Taliesin’s guidance, Yestin frequently finds himself embroiled in some mystery, seeking to put right the wrongs suffered by others. In return, Taliesin has promised to one day reveal the true secrets of Yestin’s bardic lineage. Yestin’s magic falls into three strands: magic to aid him in his travels, magic to support his music, and magic to help solve the riddles in which Taliesin involves him. Yestin maintains strong ties with his mater Ffanci ferch Fflam of Jerbiton.''

But his own magical studies have extended only so far as creating spells that allow him and his companions to more easily traverse regio boundaries.''

''Herbam Spells''

===The Magic Flute===

''CrHe 5 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind This spell conjures a carved wooden flute into the hands of the caster. The flute appears just as the caster wishes, although casting requisites are required for flutes decorated with materials belonging to forms other than Herbam, such as the animal horn often used for embellishments. Having only Concentration Duration, the flute is entirely magical and will disappear at the end of the spell’s duration, essentially when Yestin finishes playing it. Yestin benefits from his Performance Magic Virtue when casting this spell, as the act of playing the flute stands in for his concentration. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc)''

===Heal Thy Broken Voice===

''CrHe 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual This ritual spell mends a damaged wooden musical instrument. The instrument''
''is returned to the peak of its former condition; that is, the height of its playing life after the instrument had matured and settled, and before decay or accident had affected it. The instrument is also cleaned of all dirt by this spell, as that helps bring it closer to its ideal. Instruments that have more than one part, such as a fiddle and its original bow, are treated as the same item and are both repaired so long as all parts are present at the''
''ritual’s casting. A badly made instrument cannot be repaired beyond the height of its playing life, so it retains any flaws it had before it was damaged. An enchanted instrument can be made whole again, but any magical enchantments lost as a result of damage are not restored. This spell has a base level of 15 by analogy with the Creo Corpus guidelines, allowing the healing of “light” damage. Casting requisites are needed for instruments with any non-Herbam components (cat-gut, horse hair, metal pins, etc). (Base 15, +1 Touch)''

===Mend Thy Broken Strings===

''ReHe 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind With all the required parts and/or materials of a musical instrument present, the caster uses Rego magic to repair it, including re-stringing, straightening warped wood, or any other fix that could be applied by a craftsman. The spell cannot repair splintered or broken wood, but it can reassemble or replace old parts if new materials are available. The spell cannot create any required materials that are not present. This spell uses the Rego Craft Magic rules from Covenants, page 49, and so the results of the spell depend on the magus’s Finesse as described in the table.''
''Task Complexity	 Finesse Roll Clean instrument	 Trivial 3+ Re-tune a crwth Simple 6+ Re-string a fiddle	 Easy 9+ Straighten a bow	 Average 12+ Re-glue a frame Hard 15+''

''Ignem Spells''

===Let This Fire Sing You To Sleep===

''MuIg(Im) 25 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Part This spell affects a single fire, turning the very tips of the flames into pleasing music. The caster decides the kind of music he wishes to hear (a ballad, a whirly jig, etc.), and the spell accommodates. The music of the flames always incorporates a signature refrain, as though a sigil, with each casting. But the mood of that same refrain is adapted to the needs of the song. The flames play the same music all the while the fire burns, getting louder as the fire burns brighter, hotter, or larger, though the random nature of fire and differences in fuel mean that no two castings ever produce exactly the same performance. The spell ends when the flame is extinguished, its original source is fully destroyed or, for particularly long-burning fires, when the spell’s Sun Duration naturally expires. This spell cannot affect a fire that is already larger than a campfire or a fire in a hearth (essentially, any fire doing +5 damage), but a fire that grows larger than this retains the magic. Yestin originally designed this spell so that his fire, whether on the road or in his sanctum, could gently sing him to sleep. But the more he explored this new spell, the more he found new uses for it. It wasn’t just music that the flames could produce, but also speech (though limited in the range of words and voice to little more than those the caster imagines as he casts the spell) or other natural and unnatural sounds. These sounds always adopt the rhythm of the spell’s original melody, though. If left to sing (or talk) of its own volition, with no guidance from the caster, the fire sounds as''

''New Guideline: CrHe 15''
''Restore a manufactured wooden item that has been damaged to the peak of its capabilities. This spell can also restore decay, but the damage must be light.''

|}
''though it is forming words, but this is an illusion; the sounds form true words by accident if at all. Yestin has used this spell in his sanctum to experiment with different harmonies, and has on occasion established choirs of candles each quietly singing a different refrain or a different note. The effect can be mesmerizing. A Finesse Stress roll (Mastery of the spell reduces this to a simple roll) determines how pleasant the sound is, but the size of the fire determines how loud it is.''
''Size of Fire Equivalent Sound A candle flame A whisper A burning torch A conversation A campfire A song or heated discussion''
''This spell has the side effect of reducing the intensity of the target fire by 1 as flame is turned to sound. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

===Let the Sun Not Bother Me This Day===

''PeIg 10 R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell cools the caster to a comfortable level, no matter how hot the sun is or how long he stays out in it. As Yestin puts it, “the day becomes as pleasant as a spring afternoon, and loses the wrath of summer’s heat”. The target is still affected by the light of the sun, but its warmth is regulated. All other sources of heat affect the caster naturally. This spell ends either when it reaches its natural duration, when the caster moves into a fully enclosed room (or cavern system or basement), or in the event of an eclipse; it ends when he goes anywhere that sunlight cannot reach him. Petalichus the Weaver of Verditius bought a copy of this spell from Yestin when the bard travelled to the Tribunal of Thebes one year. The Verditius claimed to be interested “from a research point of view.” Unknown to Yestin, Petalichus ultimately used the spell in a long-running feud with Solar Magnus of Tytalus, a feud that ended in Stonehenge with the death of Solar Magnus. (Base 4, +2 Sun)''
''Imaginem Spells''

===Confound the Rival Singer===

''MuIm 5 R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind A somewhat mischievous spell, Yestin devised this in order to give himself an unfair advantage over his mundane rivals. The target of the spell is a singer’s voice (or the sound produced by a single musical instrument), and the spell allows the caster to pull that voice in all manner of directions. For example, it pulls notes higher, pushes them lower, draws them out longer, or cuts them off sharply. As the caster must anticipate the music or song as it is being performed, the spell requires a Finesse roll to affect the sound to a greater or lesser degree. On a high Finesse roll (9 or higher), the caster is able to change words within the song, or change entire chords within the music. At the lowest level, the caster is able to at least change some of the music to bad notes or add a croak in the voice.''
''Finesse Roll: 3+ Effect: Causes occasional breaks in the voice or the random bad or missed note.''
''Finesse Roll: 6+ Effect: The caster can choose to manipulate the performance such that it appears to simply be a good player on a bad night. The target voice might sound strained or croaky, and instruments may sound in need of tuning.''
''Finesse Roll: 9+ Effect: The caster can make the singer sound tone deaf, flattening a performance or pitching the music off key.''
''Finesse Roll: 12+ Effect: The caster achieves a fine level of control, and can even change words within a song to any other words of his choosing.''
''If the caster is familiar with the song or the piece of music, he may add his Music score to his Finesse roll as there is less need to anticipate the performance. It  may be possible to apply the spell to the spoken word, perhaps to an orator or a tutor as he addresses an audience, although Yestin has not yet experimented with this. (Base 1, +3 Sight, +1 Conc)''
''Mentem Spells''

===The Welcome Stranger===

''CrMe 15 R: Eye, D: Diameter, T: Ind This spell inserts a recollection of the caster into the target’s memory. The memory itself soon fades, but its fleeting presence is usually enough to reassure the target that he has met the caster before. The nature and context of the memory is determined when the spell is cast. Even fond or favorable memories are not enough to counteract the effects of The Gift, but the guidelines in ArM5, page 76, give an idea how the memory of an established relationship influences behavior. In later years, Yestin mastered this spell such that he can cast it both quietly and without the normal Hermetic gestures. (Base 5, +1 Eye, +1 Diameter)''

===Orpheus’ Ballad===

''CrMe 20 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group The spell creates a momentary flash of intense unnatural fear, despair, and woe in the minds of the assailants, attacking their estimation (Art & Academe, page 32). Each target in turn, starting from the target closest to the caster, attempts a Brave Personality Roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or flees the scene. This roll is modified by –1 for each other member of the group who fails his roll; the more who flee, the less resolve the others have. The magic of the spell is carried on the caster’s own scream, and extends out as far as the caster’s voice would normally carry at a high volume (in excess of 50 paces). The magic of the spell affects the group of individuals in front of and closest to the caster. The individuals must still constitute a group as per ArM5, page 113. Yestin devised the spell after he was set upon by brigands along the road from Winchester to the Isle of Oxney near Rye. He was lucky to escape their clutches after their first meeting, and ensured that he was prepared for their next. The spell is named for all the grief suffered by Orpheus, who lost so much on leaving the underworld. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +2 Group)''

===To Sing of Good Meat and Drink===

''CrMe 25 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Room Yestin invented this spell in order to reward innkeepers and taverners who showed generosity to him as he explored Stonehenge and beyond. He often weaves this spell into his evening’s performance, using his Performance Magic to hide the casting within his music. It has the effect of making those in the room somewhat thirsty and hungry. Those with a Compulsion (Personality Flaw) for eating and/or drinking are powerless to resist and must eat or drink as soon as they can. Others need to make a Personality Check against an Ease Factor of 6 to resist the temptation, assuming they wish to resist it. The effect is largely gentle and is designed to go unnoticed, beyond the takings over the bar seeing a marked increase. Yestin always uses forceless casting to ensure the spell has no Penetration, and so will not affect magi. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Conc, +2 Room)''

===Lay Your Burdens On Me===

''ReMe 20 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell brings the target’s secrets bubbling to the top of his consciousness, playing on his mind and making him more inclined to disclose them. For the purposes of this spell, secrets are those things that gnaw at the target’s conscience in the face of questioning — those things that the target would normally strive to keep hidden because of guilt or shame or fear. Secrets kept for noble reasons are not affected by this spell, which was a conscious design decision made by Yestin. This spell does not make the target susceptible to questioning on other matters, and so cannot be used to assist directed interrogation. At the end of the spell’s duration, the target must make a personality roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If the target succeeds, she maintains control over her secret and keeps it hidden. The troupe should agree which Personality trait the target uses in the roll. For each subsequent day that the spell is cast on the target, the Ease Factor increases by 1. Virtues and Flaws may modify''
''the roll and/or the Ease Factor, with the Storyguide’s agreement. If the personality check fails, the target falls prey to his conscience and seeks someone to confide in. That person may not necessarily be the caster of the spell, and will most likely be someone the target feels he can trust. The Infernal and the Dominion have a strong impact on this spell, dealing as they do with the moral aspects of human life. If the target spends time in the Dominion, the light of the Lord helps to release the truth and the level of the aura is subtracted from the target’s roll. The aura’s Temper (see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 38) also has an effect with Brave, Wise, Strong, or Just Tempers, increasing the aura’s effect by 1. If the target spends the duration of the spell within an Infernal aura, the corrupting influence of the aura reinforces the target’s resolve to keep the secret. The level of the aura is added to the target’s roll. The Storyguide may impose a further bonus to the roll based on any Tarnish or Corruption of the Infernal aura (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 13). Yestin invented this spell as a means to more easily solve those mysteries that the spirit Taliesin led him into; mysteries often solved by knowing what those involved wished to hide. (Base 5, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)''
''Terram Spells''

===The Wisdom of Sleep===

''InTe(Vi) 25 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The caster sleeps with the target object beneath his pillow, and his dreams then inform him of all mundane properties of that object. The magic is of Momentary Duration, but the sleeping mind is more able to assimilate the huge amount of information that might be called up, weaving it into the caster’s dreams throughout the night. Note that this spell does not allow the caster to actually talk with the object or divine any secrets that the object may store in whatever passes for its intelligence. This spell uses Terram in its all-encompassing form referencing all solid objects, and requires casting requisites appropriate for the target object.''
''The Vim requisite allows the spell to inform the caster of any active or any recent magical effects on the object. This spell is restricted to effects originating from the Magic Realm. Enchantments inherent to the object are not learned beyond a knowledge that some form of enchantment exists. Yestin’s version of this spell sees him conversing with the object within his dreams, wherein the object adopts a persona (or rather, Yestin’s dream ascribes a personality to the object). Multiple castings of this spell on multiple objects are possible, though the caster’s pillow as well as his dreams may become a little crowded. The quirkiness of the spell effect is due to experimentation. Yestin had intended for a more conventional spell, but he found towards the end of his experiments that the spell’s incantation wasn’t complete until the caster fell asleep. His Laboratory Text for this spell carries the same flaw. It’s possible that practitioners and researchers of Dream Magic may be interested in Yestin’s text for this spell, as it may further their own magical aims. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Vim Requisite)''

===The Well-trodden Path===

''ReTe 10 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Part As the caster walks, this spell shifts the earth underfoot allowing him to travel over rutted paths and uneven roads as though they were flat and even. The earth returns to its prior position after the target of the spell has passed. The spell ends when the caster comes to a stop, such as to rest, or crosses terrain unaffected by this spell, such as a wooden bridge or a ford. This spell has little effect on soft or muddy paths, as the earth must still be able to bear the target’s weight. The spell is potent enough to move stones and cobbles in the road. A traveler using this spell does not suffer undue delay for traveling over poor roads. Traveling at speed to cover more ground in the day still costs the stated Long-Term Fatigue level. City & Guild, page 85, provides more detail on travel speeds. Targets affected by this spell use speeds close to the top end of the applicable travel speeds. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +1 Part, +1 stone)''

===Nature’s Kindest Seat===

''ReTe 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group This spell conjures a group of seats from the ground, centered on the point the user touches. The number of chairs the spell produces can be controlled by the caster, summoning up to ten. The chairs rise from the ground and each molds itself to the nearest person as he sits back. Each chair is always at least passably comfortable, but notably more so when cast in a meadow with lush grass. Each chair sinks slowly back into the ground, leaving no trace, as the spell nears the end of its duration. The spell only works on sand or soil, a limitation Yestin aims to fix some time in the future. Yestin decided that, to better capture an audience and draw them into the music, there was nothing like a little peripheral magic to increase anticipation. Yestin has never been shy about using his magic. Yestin’s sigil manifesting in this spell can occasionally take his audience by surprise, as at first nothing seems to happen … and then the chairs spring from the ground. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 Complexity)''
''Vim Spells''

===a Song of All These Faerie Places===

''In(Cr)Vi(Im) 25 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group When the caster stands at a place where the boundary between levels of a faerie regio can be crossed easily, he is able to sing a song or play music that describes the scene on the other side of the regio boundary. As the song sings of each feature on the other side of the boundary, they become clearer in the visual illusion. They then fade slightly as the song moves onto the next feature. For example, where the first line of the song describes the lush grass, in the higher level the grass becomes visible through the boundary, bright and clear. As the next line describes the dry stone wall surrounding the meadow, the wall appears in the illusion but the grass becomes more misty and distant. Those able to see the illusion are also able to pass through from one regio level to''
''the next, as they can see the necessary method. If crossing the regio boundary requires other conditions (help from a resident or a particular date, for example), the spell does not work. As the caster must be standing exactly at the point where the regio layers meet and form a boundary, this spell can rarely be used to actually discern the location of that boundary. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group, +1 Creo requisite, +1 Imaginem requisite)''

===a Song of All These Infernal Places===

''In(Cr)Vi(Im) 25 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group As A Song of All These Faerie Places but affecting Infernal regio boundaries. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group, +1 Creo requisite, +1 Imaginem requisite)''

===a Song of All These Magical Places===

''In(Cr)Vi(Im) 25 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group As A Song of All These Faerie Places but affecting Magic regio boundaries. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group, +1 Creo requisite, +1 Imaginem requisite)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Yestin has created the following items.''
''Cloak of Wilderness Refuge''
''As Yestin aged, he began to enjoy sleeping out under the stars less and less. It wasn’t so much the effort of carrying a tent around with him that he objected to, but rather having to put it up. This lesser enchanted woollen cloak is the result.''

===an Instant Roof===

''MuAn 15 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen +0, 1/day When triggered, the cloak expands and reforms into a large tent complete with tentpoles (formed from the polished bone toggle used to fasten the cloak) to keep it rigid. The tent is large enough to allow three to camp inside in relative comfort. The effect is triggered and canceled by a train of tonguetwisting words in Welsh. (Base 5, +1 Conc; +5 item maintains concentration)''
''Song Stones''
''These small stones are charged items that store a song or music within themselves, which can then be released later. Yestin usually paints his song-stones in bright colors, and tends to give them freely to friends as amusements. The spirit Taliesin once led Yestin to Phessalia of Voluntas, where he saw a Laboratory Text for enchanting stones or beads such that they could display an image when called upon. Though he could not obtain a copy of that text, he took the idea away with him. Phessalia herself enchanted beads with pictures that projected themselves onto a wall. She apparently made little use of them beyond ensuring she had sufficient ammunition to embarrass those close to her. It had always been Yestin’s dream to follow the ancient bardic lineage he felt himself part of, and enchant ephemeral things like his music. These stones, with their magical songs bound by an arcane symbol, seemed to him a first step on a longer journey. Shortly after he first invented these, his travels became more directed as he searched for the ancient druidic and bardic magic that would support his new research.''

===Store the Song in Stone===

''CrIm 3 R: Per, D: Diameter, T: Ind Charged Item, 0 Penetration, 1/day This spell captures a song or other music sung while a small stone is enchanted, and imprisons it within. The song is of a quality equal to the creator’s Communication''
''+ Music total, and is always of a tone and content chosen by the creator. The creator can freely change the “voice” that sings with each stone, but must make a Finesse roll as described in ArM5, page 143, to determine how accurately he can mimic a known voice other than his own. When the stone is asked to sing or to speak its message, the song is freed and its music can be heard. Once the song is released, it becomes ephemeral and cannot be recaptured unless by some other magic. The stone becomes just another stone. (Base 1, +1 Diameter, +1 intelligible speech)''
''The Spear of Lleu''
''With his advancing years, Yestin became less trusting of his brothers across the Order and took to employing a bodyguard to whom he entrusted this spear. He commissioned the Spear of Lleu from a Verditius working on the Isle of Oxney, a man rumored to have visited the forge of Wayland Smith himself.''

===Neither Rock Nor Steel===

''PeTe 26 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part Pen +22, 1/day This Perdo Terram effect is able to destroy rock or metal on contact, and is what gives the weapon its name. According to legend, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, seeking revenge on Gronw Pebr for attempting to kill him with a spear, allowed Gronw to hold a great rock between him and Lleu’s spear. But so hard did Lleu throw his spear that it tore through the rock and killed Gronw where he stood. The effect is triggered by being plunged into metal armor. The target armor is instantly weakened, rusting and fracturing in the blink of an eye, and the spear pierces the armor and ignores its contribution to Soak. Against subsequent attacks, the armor has its Soak bonus reduced to half. The Target for this spell is Part, allowing it to affect a quantity of material equivalent to Individual, even where the whole is larger than a standard Individual — a great giant’s stone armor for instance. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +2 Base Metal; +11 Penetration)''

===The Telling Blow===

''PeCo 34 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen +22, 6/day Also enchanted into the Spear of Lleu, this effect inflicts a Heavy Wound on a human or humanoid target of up to Size +1. It is triggered when the blade comes into contact with a target and the haft is twisted in the wielder’s hands. The blade does not have to draw blood, meaning that great care must be taken when carrying this weapon. (base 15, +1 Touch; +3 6/day, +11 Penetration)''
''Talisman: Crwth of Yestin''
''Yestin’s talisman is his crwth and bow, a form of welsh harp played either with a bow or by plucking the strings. It was inevitable that his treasured crwth would become his talisman. A gift from his mater, the crwth has been with him since before his Gauntlet and its music has been a constant companion. Its attunements are as per the lyre and rowan wood. These are all Yestin currently knows of, but he is keen to find out whether the crwth contains more magical sympathies that are currently hidden from him. He may one day seek out a specialist in the field so he can further attune his talisman.''
''Attunements +3 create sounds +5 affect music +4 protection against malicious magic +1 Vim''

===a Song To Banish the Darkness===

''ReVi 41 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room Pen +22, 1/day When so instructed, the crwth plays a warding melody that fills the room and prevents creatures of the Infernal from entering. The effective level of the ward is 20, and it uses a Penetration of 22. Creatures within the room when the melody plays are not expelled from the room, but nor can they willingly leave.''
''The song is incidental to the effect, and Yestin is able to quiet the song by concentrating. This does not end the effect, and the music can be restarted again by concentrating. The crwth maintains concentration on the effect, and “sings the song” independently of any other music it produces. (Base 20, –1 Conc, +2 Room; +5 item maintains concentration, +11 Penetration)''

===a Song To Banish the Impish===

''ReVi 41 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room Pen +22, 1/day As A Song to Banish the Darkness, but works on creatures aligned to the Faerie Realm. (Base 20, –1 Conc, +2 Room; +5 levels item maintains concentration, +11 Penetration)''

===a Song To Banish the Mystical===

''ReVi 41 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room Pen +22, 1/day As A Song to Banish the Darkness, but works on creatures aligned to the Magic Realm. (Base 20, –1 Conc, +2 Room; +5 item maintains concentration, +11 penetration)''

===Your Voice and Mine===

''CrIm 15 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen +0, 12/day This effect is restricted such that only Yestin is able to trigger it. This effect allows the crwth to join its voice with Yestin’s. The crwth sings in harmony with Yestin, as Yestin himself plays and sings. The effect is designed to produce intelligible words. These usually follow Yestin’s own words''
''but on some occasions, and for reasons Yestin does not know, the crwth changes words and tone and emphasis. These changes are always in keeping with the song, and serve to enhance the performance rather than detract from it. The best explanation Yestin has heard for this phenomenon is that perhaps a Twilight experience also affected the crwth. Any magus able to explain why the crwth sings so independently would have Yestin’s thanks, and may perhaps gain a deeper insight into the nature of enchanted devices. Adelbert the Tyrolean, a Bonisagus of some standing at Yestin’s covenant, suggested that a supernatural agent may have been present in Yestin’s laboratory when the effect was instilled, and that perhaps this caused the Warped effect. Yestin is unsure how much the Tyrolean suspects about Taliesin, but is disinclined to have others disturb his laboratory in search of evidence of faerie involvement. (Base 1, +1 Conc, +1 intelligible speech; +4 12/day, +5 item maintains concentration, +3 effect restricted to Yestin)''
