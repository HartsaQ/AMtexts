''Concept: A magus who lives at sea, constantly testing his magic against the raw fury of the elements, and searching beneath its waters for ancient magical sites.''
''Maris of Tytalus has lived in solitude for most of his Hermetic life, sailing the Paregro Mare from his island sanctuary of Slvolder located in the Oresund Straight. Maris felt cheated by the covenant lifestyle the Order encouraged, and the intentional and unintentional assistance it provided. As a Calliclean Tytalus, he felt the assistance provided by the Nomos undermined the great conflict. To grow as a magus, Maris felt he needed a rival that wasn’t as flexible, fragile, or arbitrary as Nomi. As soon as he was able, Maris decided to leave the Nomos for a more worthy adversary, Natura. Looking to test himself against the worst nature could throw at him, Maris vowed never to accept aid from another individual until he had dominated his rival, Natura. Maris now''
''lives alone on the Baltic Sea, fending for himself without friend or teacher. When Maris is ashore, he spends most of his time in his lab, developing ways of easing his life on the ocean and overcoming the challenges Natura presents him with. While on the seas, Maris gathers supplies, tends to underwater gardens, and trawls the seas for ancient magical sites long lost under the waves where other magi are unable, or unwilling, to explore.''

''Ormurin Langi''
''Ormurin Langi or “The Long Serpent” is an old ballad about King Olaf Tryggvason, who violently brought Christianity to Norway. In the tale, King Tryggvason’s fleet is attacked by a massive force from his enemies, the Swedish and Norwegian kings. Tryggvason’s armada, although outnumbered, violently opposes and eventually repulses the two opposing fleets. However, Tryggvason’s flagship, the Long Serpent, is critically damaged in a third attack by his countryman, Eiríkr Hákonarson. Knowing that his ship is doomed, Tryggvason and his crew jump overboard into the frigid waters never to be seen again. This great battle is said to have taken place in the Oresund Straight, near the isle of Slvolder. The isle, however, was lost to history. Until, that is, Maris stumbled across it during a particularly nasty''
''storm that was unaffected by his magical protections. Located in a magical regio, the island of Slvolder is shrouded in mist, only opening when someone near is truly in peril of being lost to the sea. There is no other known way of accessing the island. Taking advantage of the magical aura the isle possessed, Maris set up a permanent lab on Slvolder to use as a base of operations. The nature of Slvolder’s regio proves to be quite an asset to Maris’ cause, preventing him from returning unless he is truly failing in his rivalry with Natura. Each time Maris returns to Slvolder, he has learned a valuable lesson, and can use the island’s resources to overcome the challenges he failed. The day Maris can no longer return to Slvolder, he will consider his vow fulfilled.''

Activities in the last 15 Years: It didn’t take long after his full initiation into the Order for Maris’ philosophies to come to light. After only five years of living the covenant lifestyle, Maris decided to leave and forge his own way. After spending five years out at sea alone, the Paregro Mare was beached during a horrendous storm that seemed to have a life of its own. Maris had washed up on the shores of Slvolder, exhausted and near death. Here he lived for another five years until he thought he had perfected his Arts enough to tempt Natura once again. During this time, he crafted for himself a longevity ritual, with a score of 8. (For experience purposes, time spent on the boat is split between exposure and practice of relevant abilities; time spent on the island is used for lab work, studying vis, etc.)''

''New Spells''
''Maris has developed these spells during his self-imposed isolation.''
''Animal Spells''

===Securing the Harvest===

''ReAn 4 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle This ward prevents any mundane pest from entering and absconding with the food growing within the protective boundary of the circle. If Maris finds that the ward has been bypassed and the food tampered with, it is an indication that something far more interesting than vermin has been in the area. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''
''Aquam Spells''

===Sense the Tide’s Boundaries===

''InAq 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind As Eyes of the Bat, but senses the displacement of water to see in the ocean’s depths. Since this spell isn’t bound by the limitations of sight, it is often preferred when scouring the ocean depths where light does not reach. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Size)''

===Captured By Höðr’s Shackles===

''ReAq 20 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Part Instantaneously, a submerged target is imprisoned in a thick casing of ice. Due to ice’s natural buoyancy, Maris often uses this spell to float something of value to the surface. If used against an opponent, the ice suffocates an individual, as well as causing +3 damage per round from cold. Note that the spell does not create ice; it only works on targets already immersed in water. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +1 Size)''

===Swallowed By the Mist===

''ReAq 20 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part This spell turns the targeted section of water to mist, causing swimmers and ships alike to plummet to the ground while the mist rises up, and then the sea crashes down around them. Successfully targeting this attack requires a Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 (6 if the target is smaller than a rowboat, as there is more leeway in the transformed area). Observers of this spell will often just see a large cloud of mist rise around the target, and the ship will simply be gone. (Base 3, + 2 Voice, +1 Part, +2 Size)''
''Herbam Spells''

===Grow the Bountiful Feast===

''CrHe 4 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle This spell ensures that all plants within''
''the circle grow healthily, and produce a good crop. The plants still mature normally, but when it comes time to harvest, all will produce the maximum amount of crops, of the finest quality the plant can produce. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''

===Plant the Bountiful Feast===

''CrHe 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group, Ritual This ritual creates a number of edible or food-producing plants. The plants appear fully mature, but still need time to produce a crop. Maris’ version of this spell produces Irish moss. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 Size, ritual)''
''Ignem Spells''

===Repel Winter’s Clutches===

''CrIg 5 R: Touch, D Conc, T: Ind Rapidly warms the target with an internal heat. This can be used to quickly defrost an object, or, if applied quickly enough, to save an individual from freezing to death. When using this spell in conjunction with treating hypothermia, the Medicine roll receives a bonus of +5. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc)''
''Terram Spells''

===Form the Hermetic Boundary===

''CrTe 25 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind Forms a large, stone circle where cast. The circle, which is nine paces across, rises out of the ground to produce a level, stone surface that is a foot high, and several inches thick. Maris likes to use this spell as a base to set up underwater gardens, which are an invaluable source of food. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Size)''
''Magi of Hermes Enchanted Items''
''Maris has designed the following items.''
''Ever-Tempting Trap''
''Every sailor knows the fickleness of the sea. One day fish are leaping into your nets, while the next the ocean is as barren as any desert. These traps help keep the holds full, but even with magical assistance, you can’t catch fish that aren’t there. Each trap must be tailored to a particular kind of prey; Maris has made one for cod. When using the appropriate trap to catch the right prey, the Ever-Tempting Trap gives a bonus of +5 to fishing checks.''

===Sight of Wounded Prey===

''CrIm 9 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind This effect creates the illusion of a certain bait inside the trap, allowing it to be used continually without needing to restock or bait going bad. The bait both appears real and puts out the proper scent. Any predator looking to feed will be almost assuredly be attracted to this item. The scent must be of a particular bait, and will only attract prey normally attracted to that scent. (Base 3, +2 Sun; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
''Eyeglass of Nereus''
''This rusty eyepiece is essential to navigating the dreadful weather conditions of the northern seas, as well as getting the drop on a foe in a well-placed fog.''

===True Sight of the Air===

''InAu 25 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Vision As True Sight of the Air (ArM5, page 127).''
''(Effect: Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +4 Vision; +5 24/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''

===Eyes of the Eagle===

''InIm 35 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Vision As Eyes of the Eagle (ArM5, page 145). (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +4 Vision; +5 24/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''
''Foul Weather’s Bane''
''Living in the Baltic Sea is dreadful and dangerous. This cloak makes life a little more bearable. Keeping the wearer warm and dry, this cloak gives a +5 modifier to soak versus exposure. Also, the cloak will not freeze, nor will ice build up upon the cloak or the wearer.''

===Cloak of the Duck’s Feathers===

''ReAq 9 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind As Cloak of the Duck’s Feathers (ArM5, page 124). (Base 2, +2 Sun, +1 Touch; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''

===Comfort the Weary Traveler===

''CrIg 9 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Warms the wearer, shielding him from winter’s harshest weather. Base 2, +2 Sun, +1 Touch; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
''Gorget of Salty Breath''
''This gorget allows the wearer to function normally underwater. Water turns to breathable air, the body strengthens to withstand the crushing weight of the deep, and the voice of the wearer will be carried far and wide.''

===Lungs of the Fish===

''MuAq(Au) 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part As Lungs of the Fish (ArM5, page 122). However, this still does not allow you enough air to fully vocalize the required words to cast spells underwater. See Voices in the Ocean side bar. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''

===Surviving the Deep===

''MuCo 30 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This effect strengthens the body, increasing its mass and allowing it to resist the great pressures of the deep ocean, as well as providing a +3 to soak. See the Voices in the Ocean sidebar. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===The Kraken’s Song===

''MuIm 8 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This simple effect changes any vocalizations made by the caster into a loud highpitched click, which allows the vocalizations of his Voice-Ranged spells to carry through the water. See Voices in the Ocean side bar. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
''The Nailed Down Chamber Pot''
''This unassuming chamber pot, nailed to the deck of the Paregro Mare (to avoid any “accidents” on the rolling seas), is probably the most-used item on the ship.''

===Remove the Unsightly Mess===

''PeCo(Aq) 20 Pen +0, unlimited uses R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind All human waste, and all associated un''
''pleasantness, vanishes upon entering the chamber pot. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Aquam Req; +10 unlimited uses)''
''Neptune’s Anchors''
''This is a series of small weights attached to a long length of rope and dragged behind the Paregro Mare. Using a system akin to modern trawl fishing, Maris scours the seas for sources of magical power. When the Paregro Mare comes near one of these underwater sites, the rope pulls tight as the anchor points the way. With a successful Intelligence + Navigation roll against an Ease Factor of 9, the user can nail down the location of a discovered site with enough accuracy to make a dive.''

===Guide the Seeker===

''ReHe 16 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind This effect pulls the rope towards the sensed vis, much like a magnet. The taut guide rope may be then followed to the source of the vis. (Base 3; +3 linked trigger, +10 unlimited uses/day)''

===Seek the Enchanted Waters===

''InVi 19 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Vision, D: Sun, T: Ind This effect detects nearby vis sources. (Base 1, +4 Vision, +2 Sun, +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
''Naiad’s Cask''
''With this device, fresh water is just an arm’s length away. After being filled with sea water, the Naiad’s Cask will dispense clean, fresh drinking water.''

===Cleanse Gaia’s Tears===

''PeTe(Aq) 20 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind''
''All salt within the container is destroyed, even if in solution, leaving drinkable fresh water. Any other impurities will remain. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Mineral, +1 Complex; +5 24/day)''
''Roll of Endless Rope''
''This incredibly useful device manifests itself as a long piece of vine, wrapped around a wooden spindle. When the end of the plant is tugged, ten feet of vine unwraps itself from the spindle. This vine is strong and sturdy as a good piece of rope, but the vine is not permanent, and all rigging generally must be replaced every duration. The grown vine may be cut off and used without destroying the device, as long as the original amount of vine remains intact (five feet coiled around the spindle).''

===Concoct Cordage===

''CrHe 15 Pen +0, unlimited uses R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind The attached vine grows an additional ten feet per activation. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +3 Moon; +10 unlimited uses)''
''Shroud of the Healed Body''
''Sickness and injury are ever-present risks on a ship, and with a one-man crew, a very serious threat. This shroud, emblazoned with the cross of St. John, keeps a man in health, and helps heal him when sick or injured.''

===Hospitaller’s Vigil===

''CrCo 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind If the Shroud of the Healed Body is worn for the duration of a wound or sickness, the wearer adds +12 to his recovery checks. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
''Tryggvason’s Chart''
''This large circle of cured leather is attached to the Paregro Mare’s navigation console. Attached to the map is a weighted leader line that’s thrown off the back of the ship. On the map appears a real-time depiction of the surrounding ocean and all the information a sailor could need, including tides, depth information, and other ships. As long as the notation this map provides is understood by the sailor, he gets an additional +5 to his Navigation rolls.''

===Reveal the Ocean’s Secrets===

''InAq 19 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part Reveal the Ocean’s Secrets senses the motion, speed, and boundaries of the ocean up to 1500 feet in all directions. Tides, currents, obstacles, depth, and other such information are constantly gathered by this spell. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part, +2 Size, +1 Complexity; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''

''Voices in the Ocean''
''Humans are not aquatic creatures by nature, and Hermetic magic was certainly not designed with submerged use in mind. There are several fundamental differences between casting a spell underwater and casting a spell in the open air. Unless aided by magical means, no words and only subtle gestures may be used to cast spells while submerged, accruing the normal casting penalties. Note that sound has a difficult time leaving the water, and Voice-Range spells cast while submerged can only affect targets in, or touching the''
''surface of, the water. Drowning is not the only threat an adventurous magus needs to worry about. The great weight of the ocean can crush unsuspecting magi. After each 10 meters of descent, a character looses one tenth of his current depth minus soak (extra soak from armor does not apply) in Fatigue Levels. Example: Hydas is diving toward a library, lost to the deep centuries ago. At a depth of 50 meters, Hydas looses 5 – 3 (Hydas’ soak) = 2 Fatigue Levels. If Hydas descends another ten meters, he will lose three more Fatigue Levels, and be in real trouble.''

===Visualize the Water’s Flow===

''CrIm 11 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This effect produces an image of the information gathered by Reveal the Ocean’s Secrets in the form of a constantly updating, highly detailed map. The map uses a form of notation developed by Maris, and is not easily understood by those who are not taught their meanings. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set, +3 linked trigger)''
''Talisman: Paregro Mare''
''Built by Maris’ own hand, the Paregro Mare’s design is based on an amalgam of the Knarr-type long ship, and the later Buss-type vessel. The ship itself is oar-less, foregoing the shallow draft in favor of a lower deck, like the Buss. Supporting only a single mast with one sail, the Paregro Mare has room for about 30 tons of cargo and can reach up to 10 knots under favorable conditions. It holds a cramped sanctum below deck, and Maris has practically lived on this vessel ever since leaving the Novgorod Tribunal. Enchanted as his talisman soon after its completion, the Paregro Mare has had several effects instilled within it, as well as having had several enchanted devices attached to it that allow it to be sailed by Maris alone, and to withstand the worst man or nature can throw at it.''
''Attunements +4 Affect Currents +4 Affect Dead Wood +4 Aquam +4 Banish Weather Phenomenon +4 Create/Control Winds +7 Protection from Storms''
''Save Our Ship''
''PeAq 27 Pen +0, 3/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Room When Save Our Ship takes effect, all water in the hold of the ship is destroyed. This''
''leaves everything in the hold slightly dehydrated, and destroys any drinking water, wine, or other liquids stored within. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Room; +2 3/day)''
''Eye of the Storm''
''ReAq 8 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind All waves, crests, or other masses of water (mundane or otherwise) break and part around the Paregro Mare. While sailing the Paregro Mare, the Ease Factor for sailing rolls will not be increased due to rough seas or stormy weather. However, sailing through strong winds will increase the Ease Factor as normal. This effect also makes it extremely difficult to swamp the boat. (Base 2, +2 Sun; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
''Ward the Drowning Waves''
''ReAq 33 Pen +0, 6/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room Upon activation, Ward the Drowning Waves expels all water from the lower hold of the ship and keeps it out. This serves as a temporary fix long enough to conduct some quick repairs. (Base 5, +1 Touch. +1 Conc, +2 Room; +3 6/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''
''Control the Reckless Vessel''
''ReAq(Au) 35 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind This effect fills the Paregro Mare’s sails with a stiff breeze, as well as controlling the currents around the hull of the boat to drive the Paregro Mare with a speed and agility unknown to other boats of this type. This effect can be maintained while Maris is elsewhere, although it will only keep its last heading and speed. Controlling the winds and the seas allows the Paregro Mare to accomplish feats most other sailors can only dream of. The Paregro Mare can even maintain course''
''without Maris needing to work the deck, allowing him to attend to other matters. If the rudder is pulled out of the water, the ship maintains its position, allowing it to “anchor” even in waters that are too deep for conventional equipment. Control the Reckless Vessel gives a bonus of +7 to any sailing checks made on the Paregro Mare. Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Size, + 1 Req.; +5 24/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''
''Hull of Unbreakable Iron''
''MuHe (Te) 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind The Paregro Mare’s hull has been enchanted to be as hard as metal. The thick timbers of the hull provide protection from accidental collisions, punctures, and damage of all types. The Paregro Mare’s hull is immune to ramming, and if another captain is foolish enough to try, he will successfully wreck his own ship if he fails the contested Int + Profession roll by more than his own Profession skill. (Base 4, +2 Sun, +2 Size; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
''Helios’ Companionship''
''CrIg 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Per, D: Sun, T: Room The lower deck of the Paregro Mare has been enchanted to produce enough light to brighten the hold to the equivalent of torchlight, and to heat it to be as warm as a pleasant summer’s eve. Not only is this extremely convenient as well as comfortable, if you are using the optional rules from Covenants this grants the laboratory the Free Supernatural Virtue: Magical Lighting (Superior) and the Free Supernatural Virtue: Magical Heating (Superior) (pages 118-119). Base 3, +2 Sun; +2 Room, +1 Heat; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/set)''
