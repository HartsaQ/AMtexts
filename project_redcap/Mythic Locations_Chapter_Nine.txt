
=The Faerie Toy Market on Devil’s Lane=

''Devil’s Lane that trades in magical toys. Devil’s Lane is a small faerie regio which has multiple urban entrances throughout Mythic Europe. A pair of Merinita magi have made their covenant within the market and the player characters may visit the market to buy or commission toys, or to take advantage of the regio’s many entrances to travel to a distant Tribunal. The player characters might also join, or usurp, the Merinita covenant.''

==A Trip to the Toy Market==

''These story seeds introduce the toy market to the player characters.''

==Story Seed: A Tempting Portal==

''The player characters stumble upon the threshold of the narrow, refuse choked alleyway that leads to the Devil’s Lane regio when visiting a city for other reasons. The regio entrance is warded (see The Alley Wards), so player character grogs may be able to see the regio entrance, but be unable to enter.''

==Story Seed: The Baron’s Gift==

''The player characters (or their agents) are present at a birthday feast held in the baron’s court. A young faerie-blooded knight, Sir Callum, presents an extravagant magical toy (The Rain Parasol, see Toys, later) as a gift. The court''
''gossip is that Sir Callum purchased the gift at a toy market in the nearby city. Curious player characters can investigate the source of the gift.''

==Story Seed: Toys that Break the Code==

''A Quaesitorial investigation comes to the covenant. Many magical items are apparently circulating in a city near the covenant, and the Quaesitors are concerned that magi are responsible and that the items will draw undue attention to the Order of Hermes. The Quaesitors initially treat the player characters as suspects due to the covenant’s proximity to the city, but once the Quaesitors have recovered some of the items (perhaps with the player characters’ assistance), it is obvious that the items are faerie in origin. In fact, a faerie-blooded merchant is buying the toys from Devil’s Lane, and then selling them on in the main street. However, the player characters may still be suspected of involvement. The player characters could try to locate the source of the faerie items to prove their innocence, or might merely be interested, like the Quaesitors, in where the faerie items are coming from. Alternatively, the player characters could be the Quaesitors investigating another covenant.''

==Story Seed: Toy Courier==

''A Redcap stays at the covenant whilst couriering a toy between the faerie toy market and another covenant. He does not reveal the details (price or function) of the toy, but he is perfectly happy to discuss the''
''toy market itself. The Redcap can guide the player characters to Devil’s Lane.''

==Story Seed: To Hell and Beyond==

''Player characters searching for an entrance to hell learn a story of a princess whose sorcerer-father was imprisoned in hell by the devil. The princess mingled her blood with that of a faerie queen and used a portal in Devil’s Lane to travel to hell and negotiate with the devil for the return of her father. The story is light on details, but the player characters may suspect that this story refers to the location of the Devil’s Lane Merinita covenant (see What is Known insert) and decide to investigate further. Player characters searching for a hell entrance might include infernalists, demonhunters, and characters seeking to recover souls (or artifacts) from hell. Magi might also seek an entrance to hell in order to close it. Player characters seeking an entrance to the Faerie Realm might uncover similar stories about accessing the Faerie Realm from Devil’s Lane.''

==The Streets==

''The faerie toy market follows a central twisting lane (Devil’s Lane) from which, like spokes, lead a number of narrow alleys. Each alley is an entrance to the regio. Faerie merchants ply their wares in stalls and stores along Devil’s Lane. The streets are usually bustling with hundreds of roughly humanoid faeries. The entire market is a Faerie regio (aura level 6).''

==Mythic Locations Devil’s Lane==

''The heart of the faerie market is Devil’s Lane. This street, cobbled with oily black stones, snakes back and forth upon itself, and is lined with rickety timber and redbrick twostory buildings. Many of the buildings have balconies, brightly-dyed canvas awnings, or protruding upper floors that extend out over the street to almost touch their opposite neighbors. Thus, in places, Devil’s Lane is more of a dark tunnel than an open street. The length of Devil’s Lane is about 150 paces, but due to its zigzag geometry little more than 10 paces can be seen at once, and it is about three paces wide. However, many parts are constricted due to spilling street stalls. In these occluded segments only a narrow path, less than one pace wide, is navigable. Devil’s Lane has two ends. One is called Upside and the other Downside, and, due to the zigzag geometry, the two ends meet. Devil’s Lane is thus a loop and a character who walks to the furthest extent of Upside''
''finds himself at the beginning of Downside (and vice versa).''

==The Alleyways==

''Extending out of Devil’s Lane are a dozen narrow, brick alleyways, each named after a city (apart from one nameless alley). The alleyways are one pace wide and 20 paces long. On the wall of each alleyway is a slate board that lists the guild rules in Latin (see Market Guild). The alleyways are the regio entrances (and exits) and each leads to its eponymous city. The market faeries refer to the mundane areas linked to the regio as “city-side,” or in the specific case “London-side,” “Paris-side,” and so forth. The terms “lane-side,” “Devil’sside,” “the market” and “Devil’s Lane” are all used to refer to the market regio.''
''The Alley Wards''
''The city-side alleyway entrances are warded against humans who do not have faerie blood. These wards manifest in different ways city-side (and also change from time to time): sometimes the alleyway is impossibly narrow, or barred with gates, or invisible, or''

[|

==Flying Down Devil’s Lane==

''Characters with the capability may fly within Devil’s Lane. However, there is a thick dome of turbulent gray-black cloud hovering about 100 paces above Devil’s Lane, which extends down to touch the buildings at the edge of the lane. The swirling dome of cloud-cover is impenetrable, thus it is impossible to fly in or out of the regio, except through the normal alleyways. Sometimes the clouds loose a barrage of rain or hail, but usually the lane is dry illuminated by a flat diffuse light emanating from somewhere overhead. The cloud cover persists into the night, so that it is impossible to see stars above Devil’s Lane. Characters with powerful Perdo Auram effects may be able to, at least briefly, clear the sky above Devil’s Lane. If so, the storyguide needs to consider whether there is an aerial regio entrance, and where it leads to.''

==Story Seed: Civic Reconstruction==

''Cologne and Constantinople alleyways are inaccessible because reconstruction in the respective cities has destroyed the regio entrances city-side. The members of the market guild council are aware that this is the cause and might commission the player characters to solve the problem (with payment in vis). However, the guild councilors are canny and do not immediately offer a commission to curious characters. The councilors surmise that magi sufficiently curious to ask about the bricked up alleyways may well try to fix the entrances on their own initiative (at no cost to the guild). Mundane construction (or disasters like fires and earthquakes) may render other regio entrances unusable. If this occurs to the entrance that the player characters use, the characters could be stranded either city-side or lane-side.''

==What is Known About The Faerie Toy Market? Characters with Area Lore: City Abilities (for the cities that contain entrances to Devil’s Lane), or Faerie Lore may know of Devil’s Lane and the Faerie Toy Market. Characters with Organization Lore: Order of Hermes, or Area Lore: Tribunal Abilities may know of the Merinita covenant at the market.==

''Known by All''
''Nothing is universally known about the toy market.''
''Widely Known''
''The existence of the Devil’s Lane faerie toy market is obscure but mundane knowledge in the cities that contain entrances to it. Many characters with Area Lore: City Abilities know of the faerie toy market and also know that Devil’s Lane is very difficult to find. Most who know this tale actually dismiss it as a mere (untrue) faerie tale. Within the Order of Hermes it is widely known that there is a Merinita cov''
''enant called Devil’s Lane built within a Faerie regio that also contains a faerie toy market. Merinita and Redcap magi have a +1 bonus to this roll.''
''Uncommon Knowledge''
''A few with the Area Lore: City Ability have knowledge of the location of the local entrance to Devil’s Lane and also the knowledge that it is only accessible to those of faerie blood. Many within the Order of Hermes know that there are multiple urban entrances to the toyshop regio. The Redcaps have documents that describe the entrances to the toy market regio. Quaesitors have a +3 bonus to this roll and Redcaps have a +6 bonus.''
''Lost Secrets''
''A few magi know that Devil’s Lane is a bridge between hell and the faerie realm. Merinita and infernalist magi both have a +3 bonus to this roll''

|]
''high above street level. Nothing prevents travel from Devil’s Lane to city-side. The alley wards have no Penetration, and thus do not keep out most magi (or others with Magic Resistance). The wards also do not keep out mundane or magical animals (including familiars). To Hermetic Intellego Vim investigation the wards are constant, faerie effects of magnitude four, analogous to Corpus, and can be dispelled. However, if dispelled the wards reappear at the next dawn or dusk (whichever is next). It is not clear whether specific faeries cast the wards or they are a “natural” feature of the regio.''

==The Rat Pack==

''The streets of Devil’s Lane teem with a large tribe of vicious faerie blooded rats. There are thousands of rats in the rat pack; some originate from city-side, but many rat generations have been born within Devil’s Lane too.''
''The rat pack is led by Mengalaz, the familiar of the Merinita magus Bartholomew, who lives in Devil’s Lane. The rat pack collectively acts as a garbage and sewage system that consumes anything organic left lying in the street within a few hours. This includes corpses, and Unconscious or Incapacitated characters. The rats may also swarm to attack (and eat) any creature of Size –3 or smaller (a cat, baby, or smaller), particularly if that creature is either alone or part of a small group of like-size creatures. The rat pack may thus be a real danger to the familiars of visiting magi. Inorganic refuse (or characters) may be nibbled upon, but are not consumed. When swarming to attack, the rats form into groups. One is a trained group of 6 rats led by Mengalaz; the group bonus is +18. The remaining rats form up into untrained groups each numbering 6 rats. There are at least 4 untrained groups, and there could be dozens, depending on the number of rats immediately available. If the target of an attack is a group too, then all the rat pack groups attack the group trying to split it into smaller groups (see Splitting Groups, ArM5 page 175). Once the opposing group has been split Mengalaz’s trained rat group tries to overwhelm the most vulnerable member of the split group, leaving the large groups to hold of the other opponents. If a rat is killed or incapacitated, the surviving members of his group attempt, in the group’s next turn, to disengage (see Disengaging, ArM5 page 173). If successful, the rats''
''flee, scurrying into the drains and refuse of Devil’s Lane. If the disengage attempt fails the group continues fighting. If engaged in combat by foes larger than Size –3 the rat pack immediately breaks and flees down filthy drains, and scuttles into narrow nooks. Apart from spells (or other supernatural powers), there is little that can stop the rats from fleeing.''

==The Merchants==

''Dozens of faerie merchants sell toys from cramped and crowded stores at the market. Most merchants are nearly human faeries, some are mortals with faerie blood, and a few''

==Story Seed: At The End of Upside==

''Those who know the correct way of walking can enter the Faerie Realm by walking along Devil’s Lane to the end of Upside. Player characters (Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 15) may notice that some faeries appear at Upside; in addition, characters with Second Sight (or Piercing the Faerie Veil) can see that Upside is an entrance to the faerie realm. However, even characters who can see the regio boundary must be guided through it by a native inhabitant of the Faerie Realm.''

==Story Seed: From Downside==

''Walking down Devil’s Lane to the end of Downside is a method of traveling to and from Hell. This is the origin of the lane’s name and a legend claims Devil’s Lane is Satan’s personal bridge to the Faerie Realm. Why Satan would need a bridge to the Faerie Realm is unexplained, in legend. The truth is that, normally, there is no hell-gate at the end of Downside, but on Walpurgis Night (30 April) an entrance to Hell, the Infernal Realm, briefly appears. This entrance is only open for a single round but is accessible to anybody. Player characters who have a reason to travel to Hell may try this method. A character ob''
''viously needs a different strategy to leave Hell (if he intends to), or be prepared to wait in Hell until the entrance opens again. Although it is only open for a moment, hundreds of minor demons (usually in immaterial form) also take the opportunity to sally forth from Hell when the hell-gate opens. The Devil’s Lane faeries greatly fear the screeching demons and thus spend Walpurgis night huddled behind shuttered windows and bolted doors. In fact, the demons usually ignore the faeries (who have no souls) and rapidly make their way down the alleyways out into city-side.''

==A Street Directory==

''The following alleyways lead from Devil’s Lane:''
''• Acre Avenue • Barcelona Street • Bologna Way • Bordeaux Street • Cairo Way • Cologne Avenue • Constantinople Street • Florence Avenue • London Street • Paris Way • Prague Street • No-Name Street''
''Cologne and Constantinople are unusual because the ends of these alleyways are bricked up (see Story Seed: Civic Reconstruction). No-Name Street is also bricked up and seemingly inaccessible. If asked, the faeries do not know where No-Name Street used to lead (or even whether it ever led anywhere at all). In your saga, the troupe should feel free to replace alleyways (or add new ones) to ensure that the toy market is as accessible (or inaccessible) as you want it to be.''

|]
''are exotic creatures like centaurs. The wares are a combination of mere glamour and enchanted items like the magic toys (which are also glamour, detailed in The Toys); some even sell mundane wares. The main currency of exchange is vis (discussed later). If you have access to it, any faerie creature from Realms of Power: Faerie may be used as a merchant; if the character lacks it give him a Bargain Pretense of 3 to 7, depending on how competent a merchant he is (not all the merchants are competent!). Game statistics are also given for a typical merchant, Walter the Book Merchant ― vary his statistics as required to represent other merchants.''

==Market Guild==

''The faerie merchants belong to a guild, which sets and enforces the market rules (see insert). The market rules are written in Latin''
''on slate boards mounted on the (lane-side) walls of each of the alleyways that lead into Devil’s lane. If the slate boards are stolen or defaced they are replaced within a day. Removal of the written rules does not have any impact on their validity. Punishments that the council can set include: warding Devil’s Lane against individual persons, seven years labor in the faerie queen’s salt mine, vis fines, and the first born child of mortals. The guild council can vote to change or add to these rules, of course.''
''Councilors''
''The guild council has five members. Votes are carried by a simple majority and quorum is three councilors. Any councilor may call the council to order. The magus Bartholomew is an additional, sixth, non-voting member of the council. The current guild councilors are:''

[|

==Market Rules==

''• Anyone may purchase from the market. • All merchants must be members of the guild in good standing, as determined by the guild council. • All merchants must be resident on Devil’s Lane. • Only guild members and worker elves may reside on Devil’s Lane. • The magus Bartholomew and the maga Julia may reside on Devil’s Lane. • Trading hours are from dawn until midnight. • The satyrs of the Black Forest are forever denied entry to Devil’s Lane. • The rats must not be fed. • All debts must be paid within a year and a day. • The workshops (and the worker elves) must not be interfered with. • Felix the wolf is the legitimate enforcer of guild rules.''

|]
''The Three Sisters are beautiful, deceptively young, and seemingly naive merchant sisters who hold the office of councilor between them (that is, the sisters share a single vote). The sisters, whose names are Lo’relyn, Fi’noa, and De’dee, mostly sell Rain Parasols (see The Toys). Count Thorstein is a flamboyant centaur merchant whose main interests are beards and manes. He sports a variety of dashing styles himself, and is very interested in the beards (or manes) that other characters wear. The count sells hats but spends most of his day trotting up and down Devil’s Lane inspecting facial grooming. Guild-Master Wendell is the self-appointed leader of the merchant guild. He is a grey bearded man in his fifties, always dressed in official guild regalia modeled on the guilds of Cologne. Wendell is very serious and pedantic about meetings and procedures. He sells wands such as those listed in The Toys. Guild-Mistress Greta is a pleasant and kindly middle-aged woman. She is not actually a faerie, but a faerie-blooded folk witch who lives on Devil’s Lane and sells her own potions at the market (see Hedge Magic: Revised Edition, Folk Witch Chapter). The rest of Greta’s coven lives city-side (in Bologna and Florence) and uses the Devil’s Lane regio to travel to visit each other. Felix the Wolf is not a merchant (although''
''he is a guild member). He is a large, sleek black wolf who silently slinks up and down Devil’s Lane policing the guild rules. If you need game statistics for Felix use Tarlan the Wolf (ArM5, page 195).''

==Buying Toys==

''The faerie merchants sell toys for the number of pawns of vis required to create it plus one pawn. Items that are sixth magnitude or higher effects cost an addition pawn of vis again. Charged items cost a minimum of one pawn of vis per charge. Mundane items cost 1 pawn of vis. These prices are the merchants’ bottom line, but usually the faerie merchants claim that the price is twice this, and are willing to negotiate down to the bottom line. Of course, if the player characters pay without attempting to negotiate the merchants are happy. The merchants do not flatly name a price in vis, but rather request an unusual payment such as children born under particular auspices, the longest piece of rope in the kingdom, or the first sheaf of wheat. The merchants specify these payments because they contain vis (usually faerie tainted) equal to the price of the item. However, the merchants are prepared to negotiate for other similar payments as long as the vis total is correct. The merchants notice, and do not accept a payment, if the player characters''
''transfer the vis from the specified payment before passing it over. See Covenants Chapter 6 and Realms of Power: Faerie pages 18–19, for more ideas of vis sources that the faeries might suggest. The merchants do not care what Form the vis is, and accept vis tainted by any realm.''

==Commissioning Toys If the player characters wish to commission a toy (rather than buy something premade), then the bottom-line price is twice the vis cost and this must be of an appropriate Art type to create the item. The initial price is four times the vis cost. The price for commissioned items must be paid upfront. See What Can Be Made? for further information.==


==Limited Life-Time==

''The toys are faerie glamour that the faeries “pretend” operate like Hermetic effects. As the toys are glamour, eventually the faerie magic fades and the toy ceases to work. All the toys, therefore, only last for seven years after purchase. Even those toys which are presented as charged items must be used within this time-frame. If questioned about this the merchants’ mutter something about a “limited warrant of effect.”''

==The Toys==

''The following toys are indicative of the what is available from the merchants. The troupe should feel free to devise more toys. The base price is given for each toy. The default offer price is twice this. Generally a single merchant sells only one type of toy and usually has multiple versions of his toys for sale. Most types of toys are sold by several merchants.''

Walter spends all of his time in his candle-lit shop, which is filled with books and stacks of parchment, and he is weary of his customers, who are mostly frightened student scribes wandering Devil’s Lane. Walter does indeed sell completed exercise slates. These are glamour that last for a year and a day (cost is 1 pawn of vis), but are otherwise completed exercise slates as advertised. Walter also sells mundane books (actually glamour facsimiles that last for seven years) (1 pawn of vis for tractatus and 1 pawn of vis per level for summae) and he sells copies of The Book of Beasts, see The Toys. The glamour facsimiles of mundane books that Walter sells cannot really be read, but the reader thinks they can. Treat any Season spent studying a glamour book as a Season of practice (with a Source Quality of 5).

==Story Seed: Negotiating with the Workshop==

''The player characters may try to negotiate directly with the workshop foremen elves. Negotiations need to be kept secret from the merchant faeries, who consider this an infringement of the market guild rules. The foremen elves don’t want vis, but instead try to negotiate some of the following conditions for themselves and the workers. Each of these demands requires a story (an advantage for both the faeries and your troupe):''
''a holiday of one season per year, amenities constructed within the workshop (such as baths, a theater, or catering),''
''freedom to regularly leave the workshop and explore city-side, pay in gold nuggets, more hats, mortal wives for the worker elves, recovery and return of items that “should not have been sold,” and are now held by other magi, mortal kings, or powerful supernatural creatures, replacement of older worker elves with mortal children (who change and become worker elves), rescuing friends of the worker elves from slavery in a faerie mine.''

''Faerie Sight. See description with Walter the Book Merchant. Equipment: Elaborate hat, apron stuffed with tools. Vis: 1 pawn of vis in heart. Appearance: There are hundreds of worker elves, and each is a short cheerful, rosy cheeked fellow, wearing a many pocketed leather apron filled with tools (hammers, files, nails). Each worker elf is identical. To tell each other apart, the elves wear elaborate brightly colored hats as a kind of heraldry. Each hat has a unique color combination, some are also hung with bells, and others have dragons, leaves, or hammers embroidered on them. Unfortunately, while the elaborate hats allow the elves to tell each other apart, it is very difficult for other characters to rely on the hats to distinguish the worker elves. This is because the elves swap hats with each other every hour according to an obscure timetable. The elves can keep track of these changes, because each elf knows which hat he is wearing, and thus can infer which hat every other elf is wearing. Note that the elves cannot speak but can understand human languages.''

==Leaden, Iron, and Tin Cords==

''These special familiar cords are created between faerie familiars and their master (in addition to the normal gold, silver, and bronze cords; see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 90). Briefly, the special faerie cords are required to balance the normal familiar cords and have the following negative effects (on both the magus and the familiar):''
''Leaden Cord: The magus rolls this number of additional botch dice when casting within a Divine aura or when touching a holy relic. Also subtract the cord value from rolled attempts to resist Divine influence. Iron Cord: If the magus is touching iron, subtract the cord value from all rolls made, and reduce his Soak by this value if hit by an iron weapon. Also add this number of additional botch dice when casting within an Infernal aura. Tin Cord: If the magus is not within a supernatural aura (of any sort) subtract the value of the cord from all Personality Trait, healing, deprivation, and aging rolls, and from his Soak total.''

==The Workshops==

''Spread beneath Devil’s Lane is a dark labyrinth of candle-lit basements. In the cluttered and noisy underground rooms teams of worker elves toil night and day to create the magic toys. Some of the basements are also infested with the rat pack (see earlier). The workshops are not a secret and any merchants questioned say that this is where the toys come from. The player characters may independently notice the sound of hammers and the flicker of candles seeping through trapdoors and under sunken, secluded doorways. The entrance ways to the workshops are not guarded, but are locked. However, the locks can be picked, broken, or opened with magic. Negotiating the maze of tiny passages, stairways, and elevators that connect the workshops is highly confusing and characters who are larger than Size +1 are''
''too big to enter the basements at all. The merchants deal with four foremen elves, who between them command hundreds of worker elves. Why the foremen obey the merchants, and why the workers obey the foremen is unclear. If asked, the faeries explain “it is just the way things are.”''

==What Can Be Made?==

''Each faerie merchant can commission in one season work equivalent to that done with a Lab Total of 100. Player characters can also negotiate for up to this amount of workshop access. Unused magnitudes from one season cannot be “saved” and used in a subsequent season. Several characters can individually negotiate for workshop access, but characters cannot combine their negotiated access, for example, to work on a project requiring a Lab Total of 200. The worker elves can nor''
''mally only work within the regio, and other characters cannot assist the elves. The troupe may need to set a limit to the total number of projects if large numbers of player characters attempt to simultaneously negotiate access. The faerie workshops can duplicate any standard Hermetic item creation project. This includes enchanted and charged items, investing effects into invested items, and preparing invested items for enchantment (see ArM5, page 96). The workshops can create items that produce any standard Hermetic effect and can use any standard effect modifications (see ArM5, page 99). In addition to the normal Hermetic Ranges, Durations and Targets, the workshop elves can also create items that use the special faerie magic parameters (see ArM5, page 92). The workshop elves cannot create, attune, or enchant a Talisman. Note: The toys are not actually Hermetic items. The toys are faerie glamour (see The Toys, in this chapter) that imitate Hermetic magic. The Hermetic item rules are used as convenient game mechanics to gauge what can be made.''

==Story Seed: Taking On a Rat==

''Mengalaz suspects that Julia will be the only available Merinitia magus to bind him when Bartholomew dies. He tries to prevent her from binding another creature as familiar (because he knows that a magus can only have a single familiar at a time). If he cannot prevent Julia binding a familiar Mengalaz tries to kill this other familiar. If a Merinita (especially one without a familiar) visits Devil’s Lane, Mengalaz encourages the Merinita to stay (as a back-up for Julia).''

''ing opposite Florence Avenue on Devil’s Lane. The covenant was founded by Bartholomew immediately after his Gauntlet, and Hermetic rumor is that his mother was a faerie toy merchant. Whether true or not, his mother does not currently reside at the market. The other inhabitant of the covenant is Julia, a young maga trained by Bartholomew. There are no coven-folk; the magi rely on the faerie market for all their needs and have come to arrangements for the provisions they require. Bartholomew has a rat familiar, Mengalaz, who leads the rat pack that swarms up and down Devil’s Lane. The Merinita do not involve themselves much in either Tribunal or House politics, and are very unclear about which Tribunal they actually belong to. Jurisdiction over the covenant is complex as the regio has entrances in several Tribunals.''

==Julia’s Laboratory==

''The ground floor of the covenant is the Hermetic laboratory of the Merinita maga Julia. Julia’s laboratory is clearly marked as her sanctum, and it is a dark and spooky chamber filled with the bleached bones and skulls of animals, mythic beasts, and even people. Julia was once Bartholomew’s apprentice, and after a brief sojourn city-side returned in 1215. Julia had a twin sister named Leda who was abducted by faeries when the sisters were aged five, and Julia’s main goal is to recover her sister. Earlier Julia thought that her sister was killed by the faeries (hence her interest in necromantic magic), but Julia now thinks her sister is alive. Julia (wrongly) believes that the elderly Bartholomew somehow mediates the relationship between the underground el''
''vish workshops and the faerie merchants. As Bartholomew seems decrepit and near death Julia intends to inherit this control when he dies, and then hold this control to ransom, to force the faeries to return her lost sister Leda. Upon his death, capturing and studying Bartholomew’s lab notes is her first priority. Julia’s magic is characterized by death and her sigil is a sound like the ominous tapping of a death-watch beetle.''

==Bartholomew’s Laboratory==

''At the back of Julia’s Laboratory is a stone spiral stairway that twists upwards for an unexpectedly long way. In fact, climbing the stairway leads to another tiny faerie regio (with a Faerie aura of 8). The regio contains Bartholomew’s laboratory.''

The chairs themselves are huddled around a small table, piled high with stacks of old cups of herbal teas. Many, long since past, futures can be read in the desiccated leaves. One corner contains a workbench covered in a colorful coiling intestine of bubbling glassware, and another workbench overflows with carefully drawn horoscopes.

Up in the darkness of the ceiling, near where the rats nest, is a small balcony that leads outside. This is another entrance to the Bartholomew’s laboratory regio, but Bartholomew has forgotten about it. The balcony can be reached from the buildings that neighbor the covenant in Devil’s Lane.

Mengalaz is the familiar of Bartholomew and although he once loved his master, Mengalaz treats the doddering old fool that Bartholomew has become with contempt. He knows that when Bartholomew dies he will also begin to fade and die. Mengalaz’s plan to survive this event is to become the familiar of whomever replaces Bartholomew as the master of the Merinita covenant. To bind Mengalaz as a familiar a magus needs to be able to bind faeries (so, normally, must be a Merinita magus) but due to Mengalaz’s small size only needs to be able to generate a relevant Lab Total of 20 or more (see ArM5, page 104 and Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 89). Mengalaz has sufficient Magic Theory to be aware of these requirements.''

''The bond between Bartholomew and his rat familiar Mengalaz has a +1 Gold Cord, a +2 Silver Cord, a +3 Bronze Cord, a +3 Leaden Cord, a +1 Iron Cord, and a +2 Tin Cord. The powers Shared Senses, Shared Powers, Shared Fatigue, and Location are enchanted into the bond.''
