''human shape looks like a powerfully built man. He uses this form when making initial contact with his victims. In this form, he has sometimes claimed that his family comes from Sicily, and one entrance to the regio in which he makes is home is found there.''
''Architectus commands a host of lesser creatures, and uses them to build roads and bridges overnight. Architectus often builds a structure after making a deal with a mortal. As an example, he often agrees that in exchange for his labor, he will take the first being to cross a bridge. He is usually cheated of his fee by mortal cunning. Architectus welcomes this process, for over time, each bridge or road harms those who live near it. Villages previously separated by ravines are able to raid each other’s flocks. Traders develop routes through the area, and bring wealth and vice. Generals use them to move their armies, and their foraging soldiers ravage the countryside. This harm usually consumes the person who made the initial agreement with Architectus. Myths about how Architectus was tricked into building a road or bridge never include this detail.''
''Architectus seems, to his victims, to be a Fury. He has the ability to halt his Berserker Rage at will, and his preference for schemes requiring decades to develop makes him difficult to classify. He often pretends that daylight, or the cock’s crow, repels him, but they do not. He finds sunlight unpleasant, but can tolerate it if necessary. His servants find sunlight painful, but are more frightened of his whip than the sun, and so can be forced to work during the day in exceptional cases.''

==Aethnici==

''Architectus raises children, partially as a hobby, but also as an extension of his grand schemes. He finds an orphaned girl with a strong Supernatural Talent and raises her as his own daughter in an Infernal regio. The girl always meets a heroic boy from the mundane world, always steals the whip that she thinks commands Architectus’s horde of demons, and always arranges for her swain to escape with her. She uses the horde, controlled by the whip, to build a great castle and fill its treasury with gold stolen as a dowry, and then tricks her wrathful father into acquiescence.''
''Architectus’s “daughters” always seem to attract heroes from small domains assailed by a slightly more powerful neighbor. The addition of a new fortress, and a pile of gold, always extends the war, by giving the advantage to the girl’s adopted nation, but only to a slight degree. The castles and palaces built by Architectus’s daughters are focuses of tragedy, and he maintains an interest in his grandchildren, since his daughters often pass on a few of their tricks to their descendants. This makes them vulnerable to further corruption.''

''Hulikang is a Merry Devil who specializes in destroying public celebrations, particularly those involving athletic contests. During the early part of the cel''
''ebration, he encourages intoxication and rivalries in the crowd. Once the crowd has been prepared, he frightens them, in the hope that they will become a violent mob. He is particularly skilled at disrupting sporting events between rival villages. Hulikang often works with a partner, a female demon who names herself Nike after the ancient Greek goddess of victory. When operating as a pair, each claims the portion of the crowd supporting one team in a competition, and tries to outdo the violence the other provokes. He is also the captain of a sports team consisting entirely of demons, called the Red Devils.''

''Mahonin is a demon who deludes his victims into believing that all kinds of inedible objects are luxurious food items. His hosts may be seen consuming filth from the night soil like it is the most delicious soup, or eating broken glass with relish while blood pours down their faces. Forcing his energumen to consume fennel seeds usually drives this demon away.''

===Morrighu, the Screech-hag===

''Order: Aerial Powers''
''Order: Tempters The larvae of blowflies were named after these demons, rather than the other way around; the term “maggoty” is used to indicate someone who is deluded by the fantasies of one of these demons. Maggots are tiny demons, no bigger than a grain of wheat, and appear like grotesque apes with the wings of flies. They eat into the brains of their victims and bring about fantasy, madness, and dementia. Often, several of these demons simultaneously possess the same victim, each inducing a different Delusion (see Powers), and each must be exorcised separately. Maggots are also called by the Greek name astasian (meaning “unfixed”), as they swarm in the air like mosquitoes and are under the command of Beelzebub. They are particularly useful to diabolists in matters involving secret communication.''
''An example of a maggot is Mahonin. Infernal Might: 5 (Animal) Weakness: Abhorrent Material (fennel) Powers: Possession, variable points, Init +2,''
''Mentem: See Chapter 4: Infernal Legions, Demonic Powers. Maggots''
''rarely have sufficient Might Pool to control their energumens effectively, but possession by a maggot is akin to acquiring the Delusion Flaw, as they may use their Envisioning Power to induce waking dreams without expending Might. Each maggot possessing a person inflicts a different Delusion.''

==Story Seed: Hulikang==

''A vis source takes the form of a yearly sporting contest between the covenant and a team of faeries. The winner of the contest receives the prize of vis. However, Hulikang has discovered the vis source, and if he is successful in influencing the winning team to violence, the prize becomes vis infesta (see Chapter 1: The Infernal Realm, Infernal Vis) instead. This situation can last for years before the characters realize that a demon is involved.''

''Morrighu is a demon of warfare. In former times she was more powerful, and she claims she was a mighty goddess of Faerie who received worship in return for victory. Now she is forced to perform her services for those infernalists who know about her, for she is a useful spirit to have on one’s side, even though she is no great warrior herself. Note that Morrighu may not actually be the remnant of a pagan goddess, as she claims.''

''Order: Tempters The Mazzikim (singular mazzik) are the harmers of man, demons of the wilderness who lie in wait to waylay the innocent. Some of the spirits that the Islamic people call “jinn” — specifically the group known as shaitans — are undoubtedly of this family of demons, as they share many qualities in common with the mazzikim. However, most jinn are more similar to faeries than to demons, and one should take care before considering them all to be evil. Many travelers or merchants take a member of the clergy with them just to be on the safe side. Mazzikim are far from limited to the lands of the Arabs, however, and may be found lurking anywhere forsaken by man. Their shape is that of a wild animal standing''
''upon two legs, with a naked human chest and arms.''

==Mazzikim==

''Order: Vessels of Iniquity Merry devils are a family of demons that encourage humans, particularly young men, to seek pleasure without regard for the consequences. Some prefer to afflict a single victim at a time, using a mixture of intoxicants and illusions to encourage the young man to perform increasingly depraved acts. Others goad bands of revelers into bacchanalian mobs.''
''When they unveil their true form, those who witness it are driven into acts of debauchery and excess.''
''An example is Merry Devil is Hulikang Infernal Might: 20 (Mentem)''
''Weakness: Protected Group (the solemn) Powers: Pleasant Clouds in the Mind, 1 points, Init 0,''
''Mentem: The Merry Devil uses this Power to create an illusion within the mind of his victim. Each use allows the demon to cloud one real object or person in illusion. For example, the demon may use this Power twice on two victims so that they do not recognize each other. The victims may be goaded into inappropriate activities, like violence or coitus. This Power is also used to make men think that urine is beer, or that a pig is a willing, young woman.''

''Rahab is known as sar shel yam (“prince of the primordial sea”) to the Hebrews. As an angel he was the authority of the world’s oceans, but had a nature that was as wild and rebellious as the element he represented. He refused to separate the upper and lower waters at the time of Creation, and was thus cast down by God and became a demon. When Moses was leading the Hebrew people from the tyranny of the Pharaoh of Egypt, it was Rahab whom Moses commanded to part the Red Sea. However, the power of Moses was insufficient for the mighty demon, so God struck down Rahab again and parted the sea himself. Rahab’s Infernal Might has never recovered from this miracle, which effectively demoted him from a Prince to a Lord, although he retains his former reputation.''
