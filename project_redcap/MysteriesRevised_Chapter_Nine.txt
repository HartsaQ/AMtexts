''Name magic, or theurgy, is the magical school that deals with the names of spirits, and how to invoke names in magic. Such practices are actively pagan, and would be subject to obvious persecution were the Church to discover them, so such practices are performed in secret, and the cults that teach name magic are necessarily among the more secretive Mystery Cults.''
''The belief in the magical power of names is a very ancient one, as is the belief that knowing a person’s or entity’s true name gives a magus power over it. The idea that magical names of power and secret signs and symbols (or synthemata) could be used to conjure beings, or to allow safe progression past the magical guardians of the afterlife, was very important in Gnostic thought and its influence is still felt in the magical thinking of the 13th century.''
''Regarding the invocation of spirits or angels, this appears in the case of Aldebert, a heretical preacher in north''
''ern France in the 740s, who composed a prayer to the angels Uriel, Raguel, Tubuel, Michael, Adinus, Tubuas, Sabaoc, and Simiel. These latter appear Gnostic — Sabaoc obviously deriving from Sabaoth. In addition to this, Simiel was identified with Samael, Satan.''
''High magic was greatly in vogue during the reign of Louis the Pious in the ninth century, when every lord had an astrologer, and in the tenth, when Gerbert of Aurillac, who studied in Spain, was suspected of being a magician after his elevation to the papal see as Sylvester II. In the Church canons collected by Dionysus Exiguus, revised by Pope Hadrian I (772795) and incorporated into Carolingian law, the use of the names of angels other than those mentioned in Scripture is explicitly banned.''
''The material in most grimoires is largely drawn from Greek and Egyptian magical texts dating from c. 100-400 AD. The greatest grimoire, the Key of''
''Solomon, may date to the first century AD., when a book of incantations for summoning demons attributed to Solomon existed, although the text may not have been identical; it is the key grimoire in the middle ages.''
''Such practices continue throughout the period, and the knowledge of Gnostic magical philosophies still persists at a time when the Graeco-Roman Mystery Cults are long forgotten.''
''The Hermetic understanding of the magical law of names derives heavily from the Gnostic cults that flourished in the first four centuries of the Christian era. Many of these cults dealt with the accession of the soul through the magical underworlds after death, and the correct names and titles of the spirits that could be encountered there. Initiates learned long lists of these names that would expedite their progress.''
''Yet these names did not just provide protection after death; as a name was''

''Daimons are ancient, named, individual spirits: the spirits of heroes and of ancient pagan deities, or the powerful spirits of sacred groves. Unlike simpler spirits, a Daimon can manifest in several places simultaneously, projecting only an Aspect of itself.''
''Magi do not summon or bind the Daimon itself: the pact spell below summons an Aspect of the Daimon. It is difficult to effectively threaten a spirit that sends no more than an Aspect, as the spirit can discard the Aspect at any time with no real loss to itself. Even if the summoner magically binds the Aspect, it''
''will just fade away to nothingness if the Daimon wishes. (See also Theurgic Spirit Familiar, The Daimonic Aspect.)''
''Summoning Daimons is typically difficult, and based on remnants of non-Hermetic magic. It involves long invocations, typically in praise of the spirit to be summoned, and invoking and imploring other spirits, and as such the Church would frown most heavily on it. St. Augustine, in The City of God,distinguishes between dulia, or praise and honor accorded to a man or power in accordance with their proper dignity, such as the veneration due to a saint, and''
''latria, praise and honor that should only be accorded to God. Magi who deal with spirits and adjure them by name are often accused of surpassing dulia, and straying into worship of these Daimons — a terrible sin.''
''A magus must know something of a Daimon in order to create a spell to summon it (see Appendix E: Mysterious Beings for sample Daimons), or have a Lab Text for the Invocation. Unlike spell spirits, only specific Daimons exist, and lab work alone is not enough to invent a spell.''

''power, they allowed the Daimons to be conjured, and gave influence and the power to command them in this life.''
''This Mystery School differs from that of Hermetic spirit magic, for spirit magic deals with relatively minor unnamed (to the knowledge of men) spirits, which it uses simply as a power to allow the sustenance and empowering of the magi’s magic. Name magic instead deals with the making of deals and bargains with potent magical entities.''

==Names of Power — Minor Hermetic Mystery Virtue==

''The maga may invoke names of the great powers (angels, planets, pagan gods, faerie lords, and such) in her magic, even if she cannot summon and bind them directly. Hermetic magi can learn to use''
''the names of the great powers as metamagic — Muto Vim acting on other spells. Most great powers have many names, each applying to different Aspects of magic, and a maga can learn each of them separately.''
''All uses of Names of Power require that the maga speak the names out loud in a firm (or loud) voice, so that the powers’ attention is drawn to her. She may not use quiet or silent casting combined with Names of Power.''
''In game terms, a Name of Power is learned as a Muto Vim spell that provides a magical bonus equal to the Name’s spell magnitude. Once learned, the Name of Power may be used in other specific magical methods, requiring other Mystery Virtues — it is no use on its own; however, with those Virtues, Names of Power are of great value.''

===Hermetic Theurgy and Names of Power===

''If a maga is inventing a Hermetic theurgy (see the Hermetic Theurgy Virtue, below) Invoke spell in the laboratory, and knows a Name of Power whose scope matches either the Invocation pro''
''cess itself, or the effect the summoned spirit produces, then she can work the Name of Power into the Invoke spell.''
''Add the Name of Power bonus to the Lab Total for inventing this spell, and also to the Casting Score when casting this spell. The total value of all Names of Power combined in a spell cannot exceed her Magic Theory when she invents the spell.''
''If she designs Names of Power into an Invoke spell, then in order to cast the spell she must speak the names out loud in a firm voice (and cannot use quiet or silent casting), although this takes no longer than normal casting of the Invoke spell.''

==Synthemata==

''The ancients described synthemata as “divine names,” which cannot, in fact, be true, as the pagan spirits are not part of the Divine realm; being pagan spirits they are Faerie or Magical beings. However, synthemata do exist, and Hermetic magi understand them as signs, symbols, or passwords that link the magician to the spirit. Many theurgic spells include these magical words in the formula of incantation, they are required as part of the formula, but do not bring special benefit to most magi.''
''Some magi have the ability to work the correct synthematas into their magic as an intense and powerful channel to a spirit, so that they may command them through this channel. Virtues to work such magic are described in Hermetic Synthemata and Synthemata Magic.''

==Spirits and Realms==

''As mentioned in Chapter 8: Spirit Magic, some relations with spirits require the magus to share types of magic with the spirit. All magi can work with spirits with Magic Might. Faerie Magic allows the magus close links to Faerie spirits, invoked to cast spells, or as a Faerie spirit familiar. Diabolic practices let the magus work with Infernal spirits, and Divine magic (see Realms of Power: The Divine) may let him form links to Divine spirits.''

''Learning this spell embodies the maga’s special understanding of a single aspect of the magic of one of the great powers.''
''This knowledge provides a bonus to other magical activities, with a scope and bonus similar to those found in the Shape and Material Bonus table. A specific name spell provides one bonus only (even if the example in the Shape and Material Bonus table has several factors). A maga may invent multiple spells for a given name, to allow different scopes or multiple bonuses.''
''The scope and bonus values possible for a power should be agreed with the troupe, and should be consistent with the mythological nature of the power whose name is invoked.''

''The caster may apply the bonus to the Casting Score of any spell (Spontaneous, Formulaic, or Ritual) that matches the scope of the Names used. (Since the meta-magic affects the magus’s Casting Score, not the cast spell, it can be combined with Spontaneous Magic.)''
''Invocation Magic requires the magus to cast Names of Power as spells, using a''
''firm or loud voice so that the powers hear his call. (The caster cannot use quiet or silent casting for Names of Power.)''
''A magus can combine Invocation Magic bonuses with theurgic spellcasting and consummate talisman effects.''

===Consummate Talisman and Names of Power===

''Those who practice the magical beliefs of Gnosticism are concerned with the magic of synthemata, and the school associated with learning these true names and using these names and pursuing a magical religion, is also known as Hermetic theurgy. The Divine aura’s interference with magic has led to many radical ideas among the Order’s theurgists, and some believe the Divine aura to be the product of the Demiurge, God’s intermediary, but different schools of theurgy see the Demiurge in different roles.''
''Most monotheistic theurgists believe in one, good Demiurge. For them, the Divine aura is a product of mortals living lives without the spiritual rites of theurgy. By living lives devoted more to bodily needs than spiritual, mortals wrap their surroundings in the Demiurge’s terrestrial influence. Monotheistic theurgists pray to the Demiurge and even to the pagan gods in much the same way as medieval Christians pray to saints, and see these beings as heralds or intermediaries between humanity and God.''
''Some monotheistic theurgists believe in various Gnostic principles. For them, the Demiurge is an evil spirit blocking the path to the true god. The Demiurge creates Divine and Infernal auras to thwart humanity’s attempts at true salvation, which is attained not by conventional religious means but by''
''magical mastery of secret knowledge and hidden rites.''
''Many pagan polytheists, on the other hand, simply see the Divine as one power amongst many that has risen to dominance. For them, the Divine auras are nothing more than the flexing might of a powerful god named Jehovah, who has become so powerful that he has claimed to be the only true god. Such polytheists are fond of citing the opening verses of Psalm 82 and other early traditions that seem to imply the Jewish and Christian god as merely the most potent of the deities, but not the only deity.''
''The idea of attaining salvation by practicing rites and magical secrets takes many forms, but one of the most common is the psychopompic tradition, where the emphasis is on the process that follows bodily death. There are believed to be a number of realms through which the soul must traverse, and there one faces a succession of spiritual guardians who block the way. By knowing the right secrets, passwords, and signs, one can command the attention of these guardians and gain passage so that the soul may continue its ascent to its final reward. The magician uses his life to gain the knowledge of spiritual beings, secret signs or passwords to influence them (synthemata), and other potent spiritual knowledge to prepare for this post-mortem ascent;''
''initiation into a series of secrets is central to these practices.''
''Hermetic theorists who subscribe to these beliefs differ wildly in their theologies, but many believe that by attaining the correct magical knowledge one can escape the judgment of God and Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory, and on death that the soul of the Initiate travels instead to the realm of Magic, which is where the guardians await. Others accept that the final path will be through the Divine realm, or even the Infernal, but believe the magical secrets learned, rather than morality or the sacraments of the Church, will be the ultimate influence on the destination of the Initiate’s soul.''
''Finally, and most intriguingly, there are those seek the greatest secret of all, that of apotheosis. They wish to transcend mortality and become as gods, just as many heroes in classical myth were able to eventually cast off their flesh and become deities. Whether this is actually possible, or just a terrible snare of the Devil to lure souls to damnation, is a matter of considerable dispute, but rumors persist that magicians have, in fact, accomplished this, and by being worshiped and venerated, and through the rigorous pursuit of their own way, have finally, after demanding rites, been able to ascend to godhood. If it can be done, few have achieved it, and they are not sharing the secret.''

''To benefit from Name of Power effects, the magus chooses one or more Name effects instilled in his talisman, casts the spell in a firm or loud voice and includes the triggering names in the spellcasting. He may apply a Name of Power effect to the Casting Score of any spell (Spontaneous, Formulaic, or Ritual) that matches the scope of the Name of Power.

==Invocation Magic — Major Mystery Virtue==

''The magus knows how to work Names of Power into the casting of other spells. This Virtue requires the Virtue Names of Power as a prerequisite.''
''If the magus knows a Name of Power that governs the area of the spell he''
''wishes to cast, then he may cast the Name of Power as a Muto Vim spell, targeting himself. The spell adds its bonus to his Casting Score for one other spellcasting, begun immediately after he finishes uttering the Names of Power.''
''A magus can utter (cast) several Names of Power in sequence, and they add to a maximum bonus from all names equal to his Magic Theory score.''

===Invocation Magic Bonus = Total of Name of Power Spell Bonuses, Limited===


===By Magic Theory===

''It takes the normal spellcasting time to invoke each Name of Power preceding the main spell, so the overall casting may take several rounds. To invoke a Name of Power in this manner, the caster must use a firm (or loud) voice: otherwise he will not attract the attention of the names. If he uses Loud Voice, or Exaggerated Gestures, the normal +1 bonus is doubled (only for casting the Name of Power itself).''
''The magus can boost his casting score for any spell (Spontaneous, Formulaic, or Ritual) that matches the scope of the Name of Power, as the spell twists his own magic.''
''If the magus botches while working Invocation Magic, the consequences can be dire — the Muto Vim botch targets his magic, and may have any conceivable effect (ArM5, page 159), including drawing hostile attention from the power''
''invoked, affecting the magus’s Magic Resistance or Casting Score, or (for really bad botches) his Gift itself. The severity (number of botch zeroes) determines what is affected and how badly. Botch effects are separate from any Warping Points or Twilight effects.''

==Hermetic Theurgy — Minor Hermetic Mystery Virtue==

''This Virtue teaches a magus how to invent spells that form a pact with a spirit. Each Invoke spell relates to a specific, named spirit: indeed, a magus can invent two spells identical in all respects other than the name of the specific spirit summoned. If a magus invents his own spell from a theurgic Lab Text, then his spell invokes the same spirit as the original; a Lab Text he writes also summons that same spirit. (This may cause conflicts if two magi summon the same spirit.)''
''The base level of all Invoke spells is the Might of the spirit called; the base level is usually all that is needed to summon the spirit. The Range, Duration and Target of an Invoke spell govern the Invocation only, not any spell or effect performed by the spirit. The Target is the individual spirit, which has no size.''
''An Invoke spell cannot be instilled as a device effect, even if the device can speak, since the magus must first seal a pact with the spirit, and devices cannot have such a pact.''
''Invoke the Spirit of (spell) and Invoke the Spirit of (Form) call specific spirits to perform spellcasting for the magus. He summons the spirit and instructs it as to the casting required, which takes extra time but allows him to vary the spell (in the manner of Flexible Formulaic Magic). The spirit casts the spell as a power, so no die roll is involved and the spirit cannot botch the spell. There are many minor spirits in Mythic Europe, and the laboratory work to invent the spell is enough to discover the name of a spirit that suits the magus’s need.''
''Like most beings, a spirit can only be in one place at a time, which may cause''

''Most spell spirits have limited intelligence, just a spark of magic: They are not usually great conversationalists. While in attendance on one who has Invoked them, they can be seen by those who can see invisible spirits (e.g., with Second Sight). Others can attack the spirit, or attempt to force it to submit to their will. The spirit resists others with its Might, and spells or powers that try to command or subvert the spirit must also exceed the level of the Invoke spell that commands it.''
''In game terms, the laboratory spell design work allows the magus to choose an arbitrary spell and invent a spell to''
''summon a spirit to match it, rather than finding a spirit and determining what spell it can cast. It is not clear whether the spirit knew the spell beforehand, or the magus’s spell research in some way taught the spirit. (Since the spirit’s power directly reflects Hermetic magic in both strengths and weaknesses, some argue that the theurgist must teach the spirit; however, theurgists deny this, and claim that they simply summon spirits.)''
''If the magus has links to other realms, such as the Virtue Faerie Magic, then he may invent spells to summon spirits of those realms; otherwise the spirit will have Magic Might.''

''Invoke the Pact of (Daimon) calls a specific Daimon, an intelligent, powerful spirit, that will send one of its Aspects to attend the summoner. Daimons may know many things, and usually perform some favored service for their summoner, or the summoner can bargain for other services.''

''If the magus knows Names of Power governing Invocation or the magic of the invoked spirit, he may add their bonuses to his Lab Total and Casting Score, to a limit of his Magic Theory score. If a magus works Names of Power into his Lab Total, they become a fixed part of the spell design, and he must utter them out loud, in a firm voice — so that the names’ attention is gained — as he casts the Invocation spell. Those around him may react to the names even if they do not react to the Invocation spell itself.''

''This generic spell represents a pact with a single named spirit that can perform the equivalent of a single Hermetic Formulaic (non-Ritual) spell as a spell-like spirit power. The spirit can vary the spell when cast, as if it had Flexible Formulaic Magic, but must be instructed to cast the''
''spell (which takes time). The spirit creates the spell effect as a power (no die roll), so it cannot botch.''
''A magus do not need to know the name of the spirit before he starts — his laboratory research guides him through the spirits to find one that answers his call. Once the research is complete, the name is fixed, and only this spirit will answer this Invocation spell. If a Lab Text is used, the Lab Text determines the named spirit. The name of the spell spirit serves as an indefinite duration Arcane Connection allowing the magus to summon the spirit and to use sympathetic magic on it (ArM5, page 84).''
''Invoke spells are Mystery magic and use the Arts of the spell the magus wishes the spirit to cast, unlike other normal summoning magics. If the spell-like power the magus desires has requisites, the Invoke spell has the same requisites. The magus does not need to know the normal Hermetic spell to invent a spell to summon a spirit that will invoke the spell for him (nor is a Lab Text for the other spell of any assistance, although a Lab Text for an Invoke spell can be used).''
''The Might of the spirit must equal or exceed the level of the spell-like power, and spirit Might determines the base level of the Invoke spell. The magus may extend the Duration of the Invoke spell, and this determines how long the spirit will wait for instruction — Momentary Duration requires that the caster immediately instruct the spirit.''
''Penetration for the spirit is determined like an enchanted device effect: it has a base of zero (that is, Might – Spell level), but when devising the Invoke spell the magus may increase Penetration like a device effect: each Invoke spell level added gives a +2 Penetration bonus.''

He may then instruct it to perform its spell-like power: this takes an extra round (or two if he has the Slow Caster Flaw), but he may also instruct it to vary the power, as if the spirit had the Virtue Flexible Formulaic Magic (it may increase or decrease one only of Range, Duration, and Target by one step, within the limits of Formulaic (non-Ritual) magic). Casting success and Penetration are determined according to the increased or decreased spell level.''
''The spirit will cast the spell once, then depart until next summoned. The spirit uses its own (Might + aura modifiers) as the Casting Score; it succeeds so long as the Casting Total is at least (adjusted spell level –10). If the magus summoned the spirit in advance, it still takes time to instruct it to perform, and the spirit’s Casting Score is adjusted by the aura when it evokes the final effect.''

''Gunnar recognizes that taking time to summon Akkala and then instruct him may take longer than he can afford, so he decides to make this a Sun duration summons: once summoned Akkala will remain until sunset (or sunrise), or until instructed to cast Pilum of Fire.''
''Gunnar’s spell is Invoke the Spirit Akkala for a Day, CrIg 30, R: Arcane, D: Sun, T: Ind. When he has invented the spell, he performs it in his laboratory. Akkala agrees to serve in future. Gunnar may now Invoke Akkala at the start of a day, then later ask Akkala to use his Might of 20 to inflict a Pilum of Fire on an indicated target.''
''When instructed to cast Pilum of Fire, Akkala can be instructed to increase Range to Sight, or reduce it to Touch, or create a blast that will burn on for two minutes (Diameter). If Gunnar and Akkala are in a level 4 Faerie aura, which adds 2 to the Casting Score of a Magical spirit, Akkala’s Casting Total is 22. Boosting the spell to Sight range adds 5 levels, so Akkala’s Casting Total exceeds level – 10. If, say, the spell’s Penetration Total is 22 (Casting Total) –25 (modified spell level), or a total of –3 successful if the building targeted has no Magic Resistance.''
''If Gunnar survives an encounter requiring such firepower, he may summon Akkala again, also to remain until sunset.''
''Example: Gunnar also decides that he would like to have more Penetration in his spirit’s spells, and works again in the laboratory to find another spirit of Pilum of Fire. (He now knows a similar spell — to summon Akkala — for a +7 bonus.) He searches for a new spirit to answer this call (as it is his habit to keep Akkala in attendance each day). He creates an Invoke the Spirit Nissila spell, with basic Might 20, Momentary Duration and 15 levels added for Penetration — an impressive +30 bonus.''
''Gunnar finds himself faced with an angry hedge wizard in town (Divine aura 3). He uses his new spell (losing fatigue, as he only just manages the Invocation spell). Nissila has a Casting Total of 20 –(3x3) or 11, which is just enough. The Pilum of Fire Penetration Total is 11 – 20 + 30 = +23. Gunnar is thankful for this new Invoke spell!''

''This spell represents the formation of a pact with a powerful named Daimon. The Ritual nature of the spell conveys part of the vis spent as a gift to the Daimon. Daimons are difficult to summon, but with this spell a maga can call the Daimon repeatedly until it hears her call and sends an Aspect of itself to answer her. This does not command the Daimon, but most will perform a specific service when summoned. (See Appendix E: Mysterious Beings for examples of Daimon spirits and typical services.) Many Daimons will perform unusual services, beyond simple spellcasting, and often beyond the limits of''

''The part of the Daimon that a maga sees before her when she creates such a pact is not the whole of such a powerful spirit, but just a part, or Aspect, sent to answer her call. A maga cannot bind an Aspect — it will just fade away, discarded by the parent spirit; she can only bind the Daimon itself if she can find the core spirit in the realm where it resides.''
''A maga may (should!) invent the Ritual at a level greater than the Daimon’s Might. When she casts the ritual, she must overcome the Daimon’s Magic Resistance for it to hear her call. If she succeeds, she accumulates points equal to (spell level – Daimon Might).''

===Level – Daimon’s Might===

''When the maga has accumulated points equal to its Might, the spirit sends an Aspect to answer her call. A maga can re-invent a spell to summon the same Daimon, with a higher spell level (and a similar spell bonus to invent the new spell). A spell of twice the Daimon’s Might can summon the Daimon in one casting, if the maga can overcome Magic Resistance.''

===Summoning Success: Accumulated Summoning Points = Daimon’s Might===

''It is possible to cast Invoke the Pact of (Daimon) without the Virtue Hermetic Theurgy, but the magus is limited as follows:''
''He cannot create his own Invoke spell from scratch, but must have a Lab Text for the spell (or a teacher) In order to accumulate Summoning Points between castings, he needs Hermetic Theurgy. Without Hermetic Theurgy, a magus may cast the spell, but the spirit will only attend the magus if the single casting is powerful enough to summon it. (It is common, but not mandatory, for non-theurgist magi to cast this ritual in a group, with the aid of Wizard’s Communion.)''

==Theurgic Spirit Familiar — Minor Hermetic Mystery Virtue==

''This is essentially identical to the Virtue Spirit Familiar described in Chapter 8: Spirit Magic, except insofar as Theurgic Spirit Familiar is part of the school of name magic rather than spirit magic. Also, if powerful enough, a maga may seek to ally with a Daimon spirit as her familiar.''
''If a maga binds a Daimon, she only binds a single Aspect of the Daimon, not the entire spirit — others may still summon Aspects of the Daimon, and the''
''greater part of the spirit will not usually inform her of this (as it does not concern its relationship with her). Her Daimon Aspect does retain the ability to manifest in more than one place, and it can use this in cooperation with the maga. Note that, while a single Aspect attends the maga, her bond is with the Daimon itself, and the attending Aspect may be reunited with the Daimon, which sends another Aspect to fulfil the bond.''

===Finding and Binding a Daimon===

''A magus who seeks a Daimon familiar must research a likely Daimon, deter''

[|
''Daimons and similar unique powerful spirits have a special power of creating an Aspect. The Aspect is a fraction of the whole spirit sent into the mortal world to interact temporarily with others, while the core of the spirit remains in its place of power, such as the Hall of Heroes.''
''Each Aspect is like an independent spirit that can be created or allowed to lapse in an instant. Each starts without wounds, and with its own pool of Might points (Daimons are untiring spirits, and do not have fatigue levels). The Daimon may have powers that are limited in uses per day (for example, an ascended magus’s talisman enchantments), and each Aspect counts these separately. An Aspect does not recover wounds or Might points used while on Earth, rather it is eventually dispelled and later replaced by another Aspect.''
''There is no fixed limit to the endurance of an Aspect, but they only remain while they are conscious and have Might remaining.''
''An Aspect is normally a disembodied spirit, but can create a earthly, bodily form at will. While disembodied they are like ghosts (see Chapter 8: Hermetic Spirit Magic: Ghosts in Ars Magica). While embodied they can suffer wounds but are untiring; if this body is slain, the Aspect returns to its parent Daimon.''
''There are limits to this: An Aspect cannot be summoned into a place where there is already an aspect of the same Daimon, nor where there has been an Aspect in the past day. A Daimon’s Aspect, conjured elsewhere and moving through the world, will not willingly enter a place where there is or has been another Aspect within a day. The size of “place” that prevents an Aspect is not well defined, but is at least several miles across: this is in part to keep stories simple by avoiding “collisions.” This also prevents an Aspect from leaving and returning within a day.''
''In addition, no permanent changes can be made to any Aspect, as they never last. The most that can be done is to seal a pact with the Daimon to provide an Aspect to attend the magus; this is what a Daimon bound as theurgic spirit familiar provides.''
''If the Daimon is encountered in its place of power, outside the world, then this is its one true form, and no Aspect of it may appear in that place – except when returning to the place to merge with the true spirit. Daimons frequently encounter other Daimons and spirits in their true places, but almost never encounter mortals. It may even be that the Hall of Heroes is beyond the Lunar Sphere, which might explain why magi cannot find it.''

==The Daimonic Aspect==


|]
''mine its abilities as they are understood by magi (including determining whether they are in sympathy with his magic), learn as much as he can of its name, history, past life (if any), its beliefs and habits — and whether it is likely to respond well to the suggestion of bonding itself to a magus. (As a rule of thumb, if the (Technique + Form) proposed for the bond is less than 2 x Might, it is likely to reject the magus as not worthy.) (Consult Appendix C: Mysterious Beings for examples of Daimon powers and characteristics.)''
''If the magus judges it a good match, then he may invent a version of the Invoke the Pact of (Daimon) ritual to summon this Daimon, and offer himself to it as ally. (Noting that use of Hermetic synthemata to compel attendance will not generate a favorable opinion.) Unlike the lesser spirits, summoning a Daimon is an acceptable means to initiate contact — indeed, essentially the only means.''
''If the magus has judged the Daimon well, and impresses it, then it may agree to join him; if he misjudges, annoys, or irritates it, it may take affront at his suggestion and even attack; or if generous, it may decline his offer but consider the normal pact service for the magus.''
''If it agrees, then the magus must begin by sacrificing a number of pawns of vis to the Daimon equal to its Might/5 (round up) and it will then accompany him to his laboratory, if he is not already there.''

==Ascendancy to the Hall of Heroes — Major Hermetic Mystery Virtue==

''This Virtue teaches a Mystery path enabling the magus to ascend to the Hall of Heroes and join the pagan gods; a process known as apotheosis. The Virtue requires the Hermetic Theurgy Virtue as a prerequisite.''
''It is favored as a path to immortality by pagan-oriented name magic Mystery Cults, and by the Gnostic Philosophers of Rome. Apotheosis was a common motif in Greco-Roman legend, and Simon Magus, father of Gnosticism, professed to believe he had attained godhood.''
''This is in some ways perhaps the hardest method of reaching immortality, as it cannot be followed by the lone magus, but requires co-operative effort. By means of this Virtue, a hierarch may devise two ritual spells to enable his ascension to the heavens, or at least to the remnant pagan pantheon (or, as the cruder, secular Hermetics might say, into the pages of the Daimonic bestiary). These two ritual spells are non-Hermetic Mystery Rituals — for game mechanic purposes they are designed and cast as spells, but they are non-Hermetic magic.''
''The spells are designed specifically for one magus, so no Warping is inflicted for a high-level effect.''
''The Initiated hierarch gains the knowledge to devise the ritual for his own ascension, but cannot cast it himself — rather he requires a group of celebrants (cultists) who provide the magical energy to the hierarch to allow for his apotheosis through their faithful devotion and worship.''

===Ascendant Form of the Intendant Hierarch===

''(Te)(Fo) Gen R: Per, D: Sun (Special), T: Ind, Mystery Ritual''
''This is specified and researched as a Ritual spell, but is really a rite of the Mystery.''
''The hierarch constructs a prototype ascendant form for himself, embodying''
''all that is best in his magic. The hierarch temporarily takes on an aura of power and perfection. While the ritual effect lasts, the hierarch’s followers cast Transformation of the Ascendant Hierarch, in the hope that their hierarch will make progress to perfection. During the ritual’s effect, all of the hierarch’s abilities (except his future Magic Might) are manifest in their strongest form, although the hierarch is carried away by his own immanent glory and cannot usefully act other than to accept ritual offerings.''
''The Mystery rite requires the intendant hierarch prove himself and his celebrants’ worth: the celebrants must prove their worth by overcoming the intendant hierarch’s Magic Resistance with their own Ritual spell. No short-cuts are permitted, so the magus must have performed his full Parma Magica, and manifest (not suppress) his full Magic Resistance.''

[|

==Immortal Magi as Familiars==

''The Mystery Ascendancy to the Hall of Heroes transforms a magus into an immortal Daimon spirit. It would then be possible for a living magus, perhaps a follower of the cult that assisted in the ascendancy of the Daimonic magus, to ally an Aspect of the Daimonic magus as his own spirit familiar.''
''This would be an interesting way to draw an ascended immortal into stories in an on-going saga.''

==The Hall of Heroes==

''Little is known by mortals of the Hall of Heroes. In Christian times, most people, including magi, would deny that any such thing remained at all. (Many Hermetic magi prefer to stress the secular nature of their learning, and describe Daimonic spirits as “just part of the spirit bestiary.”) Nevertheless, Daimonic spirits appear to exist, and there are significant numbers of them, even just counting those known to Hermetic magi. Pagan magi claim that the pantheon of gods still exists, if mostly cut off, with access to and by worshippers today confined to the sacred groves, which often exist in magical regios.''
''The new spiritual magus may encounter other Daimonic spirits; some may prove to be allies if approached favorably, others may be hostile (or part of enemy groupings in the Hall of Heroes). Spiritual allies may guide the new magus, or even assist him. They may perhaps be bargained with for assistance, as all the remnants of the old pantheons desire the “worship,” observance, prayers, and offerings of mortals.''

|]
''The Technique and Form of this Ritual are the hierarch’s best Arts, and the level of the Ritual must equal or exceed their total, and a minimum level of 40. When the whole process is complete, the ascended hierarch will have a Might of (this Ritual’s level/2).''
''Once begun, the ascendant form continues until the Transformation of the Ascendant Hierarch has been performed, after which either the magus ascends as a Daimon, or both spells end. The Transformation Ritual must be completed before sunrise or sunset.''
''(Special Mystery)''

===Transformation of the Ascendant Hierarch===

''CrVi Gen R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind, Mystery Ordeal Ritual''
''Transformation of the Ascendant Hierarch is cast on a magus who has already cast Ascendant Form of the Intendant Hierarch upon himself. The level of this ritual must exceed that of the Ascendant Form ritual, and the caster must overcome the target’s Magic Resistance (which cannot be suppressed — see that spell description). (It is normal for a group of celebrants to use Wizard’s Communion to aid their Penetration).''
''The target (the hierarch) is tested by the ritual, and appears wreathed in lambent flame and golden nimbus for the duration of the spell. He is also subject to intense agony as the spell courses through his body, but he must endure this in order to ascend. The hierarch makes a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9, or passes out (although he still benefits from the ritual unless he botches the Stamina roll). When the Transformation spell ends, the Ascendant Form ends too.''
''(Special Mystery)''
''Given the constraints of the rituals, it is likely that the hierarch will work with a group of magi in the laboratory so that a celebrant invents (and learns) the Transformation Ritual and can cast it on the hierarch. The hierarch invents his own Ascendant Form Ritual (but may accept the celebrants’ assistance in the laboratory).''
''The cultists can then cast the Transformation as a group, relying on spells such as Wizard’s Communion to boost their Penetration and overcome the Magic Resistance of their ascendant hierarch.''

===The Cumulative Transformation Process===

''If the Transformation Ritual overcomes the hierarch’s Magic Resistance, accumulate transformation points equal to Transformation spell level – Ascendant Form level. The base total of points needed is the level of the Ascendant Form spell. In addition, points are needed to perfect any failings the hierarch suffers from:''
''Count the pyramid point cost of any negative characteristics the hierarch has and multiply by three (ignore positive characteristics). Add five times Decrepitude score. Total the number of Virtues (Major Virtue = 3 points, Minor Virtue = 1 point); total the number of Flaws (Major Flaw = 3 points, Minor Flaw = 1 point). If Virtues equal or exceed Flaws, the magus is satisfactory but gains no bonus; if Flaws exceed Virtues, then additional Transformation points are needed, equal to five times total Flaw points.''
''•''
''• •''

===Count Major Flaws and Virtues As 3===


===Point Each, Minor As 1 Point Each.===


===Flaws Are Excessive If Flaws Exceed===


===Virtues.===

''Transformation Needed = Ascendant''
''Form Level + 3 x cost of Negative Characteristics + 5 x Decrepitude + 5 x''

===Flaw Points If Excessive===

''Transformation Points = Transformation''
''Level – Ascendant Form Spell Level''
''When accumulated points equal the total needed, the ritual cycle is complete, and the hierarch ascends, becoming a being of pure Might — a Daimon.''
''Example: Gloria has been selected by her cult as a perfect maga, and the cult desires to see her ascend to godhood, to join the Hall of Heroes. She has best scores of Rego 34 and Animal 32, and devises a level 66 Ascendant Form ritual for herself. She and her followers work together to devise a Creo Vim 75 Transformation ritual, working as a group so that Servus (her most senior follower) invents the spell for himself with the assistance of the others.''
''Gloria has suffered a number of aging failures and has 16 aging points (Decrepitude 2), and has Qik –1, Str –2, Per –1. (Her other Characteristics are positive or zero.). She began her career with an equal balance of Virtues and Flaws, but has gained four Minor Virtues and Ascendancy to the Hall of Heroes (a Major Virtue); and suffered two Minor Ordeal Flaws, and two Twilight-driven Minor Flaws.''
''She needs a transformation total of 66 (her Ascendant Form level) + 3 x (1+1+3) (pyramid cost of negative characteristics –1, –1, –2) + 5 x 2 (decrepitude 2) = 91.''
''She has 17 Virtue points (10+4+3) and only 14 Flaws (10+2+2): her Virtue exceeds her Flaws, so there is no effect.''
''The total transformation needs 91 points, Her followers grant her 75 – 66 = 9 points each time they succeed in their ritual, so it will take 11 ritual ceremonies to perfect her form.''

===Ascension===

''The magus becomes a pure, perfected, unchanging immortal, divorced and cut off from the mundane world. The new spirit may be seen in the heavens as''

[|

==Familiars and the Ascendant Magus==

''If a magus has a spirit familiar, then it automatically stays with him, and requires no extra vis to do so, as it is already a free spirit.''
''Otherwise, the familiar faces a choice when its master ascends: it may remain in life and lose him, or join him in ascendancy by sharing the ritual Ordeal, provided additional pawns of raw vis equal to the Familiar Bond Score/5 (round up) are expended in the Ritual. (The mystery allows for this — see also Appendix A: Immortal Magi, Becoming Immortal with a Familiar.)''
''Ascended heroes with companion familiar spirits form some of the famous heroic pairs in the Hall of Heroes.''

|]
''a nova stella, or new star. When he first ascends, he shines brightly, to announce his presence to the world, but over time his brilliance may fade to reflect his relative status among the other heroes. It is said that the greatest heroes and gods from the time of myths ascended to form entire constellations, but no new constellations have arisen in known time.''
''Such ascended spirits form some of the heroes in the Daimonic bestiary: It is now possible to summon the magus.''
''The magus’s talisman, if he has one, becomes a part of his immortal being, a source of power from which he can invoke effects — just as he could in life. (This is true whether the talisman is a normal object, or his spirit or body — see Chapter 8: Hermetic Spirit Magic, Inscription on the Soul and Spirit vs. Body Enchantments.)''
''The magus’s mortal body is left behind as a useless empty shell. Any enchantments still on the body are dispelled and any remnant vis is consumed by the ascending spirit. The body remains an Arcane Connection to the Daimon spirit. Most cultists take some small portion, such as a bone, as a relic to use when''
''summoning their Daimonic leader; but they often destroy the larger part of the body lest it fall into enemy hands.''

===The Daimonic Magus===

''As a Daimon, a magus has the Daimonic power to manifest Aspects in multiple locations simultaneously (see The Daimonic Aspect).''
''The Daimonic magus is immune to aging and Warping. He has the immortal benefit of resistance to, and undoing of change (see Appendix A: Immortal Magi). However, the Daimonic magus has surrendered all earthly ties, including laboratory use, and cannot use the talisman enchantments of Appendix A to study and improve. This might seem to mean that the Daimon magus cannot learn as he cannot change, but players should not''

[|
''The normal Daimonic summoning spell is more of a contractual bargain than initially appears, as the Daimon gains spiritual strength that can be used for learning, and in return a summoned Daimon performs an agreed-upon service. This may explain why Daimons are generally agreeable when summoned, in contrast to other summoned beings, who generally resent the summons.''
''A player-character Daimonic magus may be summoned by an Invoke Pact spell devised for his spirit. This provides''
''him with the pact benefits in return for his providing a magical service, just as with a normal Daimon spirit. Players may well find that gaming out such services provides a new and different story theme for the troupe.''
''The Daimon gains a benefit equal to the Invocation spell level/5 (round up) — this is the same as the vis cost of the Invocation Ritual spell. The spirit gains the benefit when the Invocation points total equals his Might, and he is called to appear.''

==Invoke the Pact of (Daimon)==


|]
''despair for their favorite characters, for the cultist magi left behind may perform rituals to aid the spirit, granting further powers and abilities.''
''A Daimon is an untiring spirit, with no Fatigue levels. (In this, it is similar to a faerie.) Mundane activities that might tire a mortal being do not tire a Daimon. For magical activities that call for the expenditure of Fatigue, the Daimon expends 5 Might for each Fatigue level normally expended. This includes casting Spontaneous Magic, Formulaic spells where Casting Total is below spell level, Ritual spells, and Virtues like Life-Boost and Life-Linked Spontaneous Magic.''
''If the loss of Might to replace Fatigue takes an Aspect to 0 Might or below, it fades away and returns to the parent Daimon. (The spell succeeds or not according to the normal rules for Fatigue loss; in most cases the effect is produced and then the magus loses Fatigue or Might.)''

===Learning and Improving As a Daimonic Spirit===

''Daimon Points provide a ways for cults to help their favored spirits grow. The player of the Daimonic spirit may accumulate Daimon Points for her character, and use these points as below. She may save and accumulate points until needed.''
''The Daimonic pact spell Invoke the Pact of (Daimon) grants spiritual strength, expressed in game terms as:''

===Daimon Points = (Spell Level) / 5===

''Daimon Points may be spent as follows:''
''Study: 1 Daimon Point can be used to “fix” a study experience point, so that it is not lost. This takes place in a second season, the season after the season of study. If not fixed, excess study points are lost at the end of the second season. 1 Daimon Point can be used to “fix” a magnitude of spell learned so that it is not lost. This takes place in a second season, the season after the''

===•===


===•===

''season the spell was learned. If not fully fixed, the spell is lost at the end of the second season. Increase Might: 5 Daimon Points can be used to increase Might Score by 1 point. Increase Characteristic: 10 times the character purchase cost of a Characteristic increases a Characteristic by 1 point. (Improving negative characteristics take as many points as they gave originally, so to increase a –3 Quickness to –2 takes (3 x 10) or 30 points.) There is no practical limit to the characteristics of Daimons, other than the enthusiasm of their followers. Learn from Other Spirits: Daimon Points can be bargained and traded with allied Daimonic spirits: typically a spirit will teach a spell or spell-like power to another in return for Daimon Points. Half the points are lost in the transfer, so the teacher charges (spell magnitude) Daimon Points, and but this costs the pupil twice (spell magnitude). The teaching takes a season, taught as a spell, and the magus spirit must then spend a second season to “fix” the spell (as above).''
''Clearly Daimons need to accumulate a number of ritual summons benefits before embarking on some of these processes.''
''(Note that disembodied “pagan gods” are not normally found studying by turning the pages of books in libraries, or slaving over grimoires and glassware in a laboratory — they have other calls on their time. Learning by practice, or teaching from other spirits is the normal method, if such can be considered normal.)''

==Hermetic Synthemata — Minor Hermetic Mystery Virtue==

''There are many meanings and powers attributed to the name of a being. The ancients attribute special names, symbols, signs, and passwords they called synthe''

===•===


===•===


===•===

''mata to each mystical being or power. Hermetic magi with this Virtue have learned how to use synthemata as a key to overwhelm Magic Resistance. Any being with a Might score has synthemata.''
''Synthemata are especially useful in summoning Daimons, as the Daimon summoning spells must exceed the Might of the spirit to accumulate binding points, but must also overcome Magic Resistance. Synthemata let the magus do this (although the Daimon will be ill-disposed toward him if he does).''
''A synthemata formula is unique to one being, and increases Penetration so that the magus with this spell may inflict any spell he desires upon his victim. The victim, in turn, is made aware if the spell is cast in its presence, so merely casting the spell acts as a lever to demand cooperation.''

===Synthemata of (X)===

''MuVi Gen R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind, Mystery The spell is unique to one named being, and the spell level must equal or exceed its Might. The synthemata spell affects the caster so that the caster adds the synthemata level to the Penetration Total of any spell cast (or begun) immediately after the synthemata spell.''
''(Base named being’s Might)''
''Momentary Duration works for a spell cast immediately after the synthemata spell, but magi often research a spell with extended Duration, allowing a delayed or multiple casting.''

===The Lasting Synthemata of (X)===

''MuVi Gen R: Per, D: Diameter, T: Ind, Mystery The spell is unique to one named being, and the (spell level – 5) must equal or exceed its Might. The synthemata spell affects the caster so that the caster adds the synthemata (level – 5) to the Penetration Total of any spell cast (or begun) after the synthemata, until the end of the synthemata spell.''
''Diameter duration synthemata are especially popular, as the synthemata can be used several times without concentration. In addition, while the synthemata spell is in effect, the being is aware of''
''the spell and its threat, and usually very much inclined to negotiate if the caster allows it to.''
''(Base named being’s Magic Resistance, +1 Diameter)''

===Researching Synthemata===

''Synthemata are very difficult to research, and most easily learned from Lab Texts.''
''The base level of the spell must equal or exceed the Might of the target being; if a magus does not know its Might, then he must guess. In addition, the magus uses (Realm) Lore instead of Magic Theory in his Lab Total for this research.''

===Lab Total = Muto + Vim + Intelligence + (Realm) Lore +===


===Aura + Bonuses===

''A magus may use sympathetic magic factors to add to the Lab Total. Calculate the “multiplier” (as on ArM5, page 84) that would be given by the Arcane Connection, secret name, Horoscope, etc. and add this value as a bonus to the Lab Total.''
''Unfortunately, many powerful beings have means to hide their synthemata from magi (known as name hiding) that are reflected in an adjustment to the spell design difficulty (although not the level of the actual spell produced). The magus devises the spell as normal, subtracting spell level and accumulating points to reach the spell level when the spell is complete. However, name hiding is subtracted from the normal points per season:''

===Spell Points Accumulated = (Lab Total===


===– Spell Level – Name Hiding)===

''The value of name hiding varies, but if a spirit hides its name, the name hiding is usually around (Might/2) points.''

===Typical Name Hiding = (Might / 2)===

''Curiously, some beings have a negative name hiding. Middleand low-rank demons are rumored to make their names especially easy to discover, as commanding them into unspeakable acts is exactly what they desire.''
''Each season, the magus accumulates the adjusted points total. When he believes he has enough points to have''
''completed the spell, he may try it. Or he may continue to accumulate points until he feels more confident that the spell will work — little annoys a summoned being more than a failed attempt at inflicting synthemata on it (only inflicting real synthemata, but then they have no power over the caster). Note that a magus will know when he ought to have completed the spell with no hiding.''
''The completed spell, when it works, boosts the magus’s Penetration against the named target being by the spell’s base level. This ensures that even Spontaneous Magic spells should penetrate the being’s Magic Resistance. If the magus casts synthemata in the presence of the being, it effectively''
''inflicts a 0-level full-Penetration effect on the being which, as it penetrates, informs them that his has its synthemata.''

===Grimoires===

''Clearly the spell design process is long and uncertain, For this reason, magi''
''place great value upon grimoires (Lab Texts for synthemata spells).''

===Revealing Synthemata===

''Most spirits do not know their own synthemata, either through ignorance or through choice. The result of this is that a magus cannot normally expect to command a spirit to reveal its own synthemata. However, powerful spirits may have spirits that they themselves command, and they often do so by knowing the synthemata of those spirits. If a magus successfully commands a powerful spirit, it might reveal one or more of those synthemata.''
''If a spirit reveals synthemata to a magus, the magus may ignore name hiding when researching those synthemata in the laboratory, thus making the process much faster and removing the uncertainty.''
''As a guideline, assume a powerful spirit may know synthemata of other spirits whose Might Scores add up to no more than its own Might, and no individual higher than its own Might/2. Especially powerful spirits know synthemata of spirits who in turn know those of lesser spirits.''

==Synthemata Magia — Major Supernatural Mystery Ability==

''This is a non-Hermetic method, the predecessor of Hermetic Synthemata research, but still of considerable value to Hermetic magi. The Hermetic method''
''is slow, but very powerful, while the nonHermetic method is much weaker, but might let a magus intuit synthemata at a glance.''
''The Virtue uses the (Realm) Lore Abilities.''

===Intuit Synthemata===

''If the magus is in the presence of a being or spirit with a Might Score, then even a brief interaction with the being may let him intuit the synthemata. If the being lacks a Might Score, then the magus cannot use this talent against it. He intuits synthemata if he succeeds at a roll of Perception + (Realm) Lore against an Ease Factor of the being’s Might + name hiding. For intuit synthemata, both the magus’s roll and the Ease Factor are adjusted according to the local aura:''

===Stress Die + Perception + (Realm) Lore===


===+ Magus’s Aura Modifier Vs. Might + Spirit’s Aura Modifier + Name Hiding===

''If the magus fails this roll, he cannot intuit the spirit’s synthemata. He may not try again until his abilities improve — that is, his (Per + (Realm) Lore + any Virtue bonuses) increases to a higher score.''
''If you botch the roll, the spirit is immediately made aware of his attempt, and is likely to be hostile. If you roll more than one zero in the botch roll, the magus inadvertently creates a temporary channel''
''to the spirit that it may use to bypass the magus’s Magic Resistance.''
''If the magus succeeds, he has deduced a magical synthemata. He cannot teach this intuited synthemata — it is a unique link between him, his magic, and the being whose synthemata it is.''
''Learning the synthemata grants the magus (and only the magus) access to a Muto Vim guideline to boost Casting Score against the named being:''
''Muto Vim General: Add spell level to the caster’s''
''Casting Score for spells cast while this spell lasts. Momentary duration is sufficient to affect spells cast in the next round.''
''The magus may cast synthemata as a spontaneous spell, or invent a Formulaic spell. Unlike Hermetic Synthemata, there are no special laboratory requirements: there is no minimum level, Magic Theory is used (not Realm Lore), and name hiding is ignored (as he already knows the name). Lab Texts for such a spell are no use to others — they embody the unique, personal link that the magus gained above.''

===The Hedge Lord’s Synthemata of (X)===

''MuVi Gen R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind The spell adds its (level–5) to the caster’s Casting Score against the named being for two minutes.''
''(Unique guideline, +1 Diam)''

===Researching Synthemata===

''A magus may also try to research the synthemata of a being he has previously encountered in person. He can do so even if he failed to intuit its synthemata.''
''By fasting and invocation, over the course of an entire season, the magus attempt to research the synthemata. He learns the synthemata on a success in a roll of Perception + (Realm) Lore + aura modifier against an Ease Factor of the being’s Might + name hiding (no aura modifier):''

===Stress Die + Perception + (Realm) Lore===


===+ Aura Modifier + Bonuses Vs. Might +===


===Name Hiding===

''If the magus has a sympathetic or Arcane Connection to the being, he may use this in a similar manner to those with Hermetic synthemata: calculate the “multiplier” as in ArM5, page 84, and add the score as a bonus to the synthemata research roll.''
''Failing this roll does not prevent future attempts. Botching the roll may still attract the attention of the being, but hopefully the covenant’s Aegis of the Hearth can ward out the offended spirit.''
