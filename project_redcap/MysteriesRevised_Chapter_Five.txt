''In the 13th century, the practice of alchemy is a new science that is proving popular all over Europe, following the introduction of the alchemical principles from the Arabic world in the mid-12th century. The alchemists seek to learn the innate properties of materials, and by their experiments to refine substances and seek new discoveries, such as dyes, alloys, and useful chemicals or drugs. There are alchemists in most large European cities and it is a growing and fashionable area of study. The secret of turning lead in to gold is the ultimate goal of much mundane alchemy, but even unGifted alchemists''
''also seek spiritual perfection, and the science draws upon what is believed to be an ancient secret of mystical initiates.''
''Hermetic Alchemy is a specialized branch of this knowledge that adapts the insights of the alchemical science and applies them to the Hermetic Art, in particular to the transmutation of vis. The basic principle of this then-secret Art was rediscovered by Jahm of Alexandria, an Ex Miscellanea magus, in the tenth century, and he first adapted the alchemical sciences to Hermetic usage in a series of magical breakthroughs that also resulted in the discovery of Philosophic Alchemy.''

''Alchemy is an ancient tradition. The earliest known Greek alchemical text, dating from the first century, is the Pysika kai Mystika by PseudoDemocritus. Synesius states that the work was originally in four books about the manufacture of gold, silver, gems, and purple. These, together with the school of Mary the Jewess (who was credited with inventing an efficient still, the water bath and the kerotakis), form the early basis for alchemical thought, although the ultimate origin of PseudoDemocritus’ alchemical tradition was probably Bolos of Mendes who lived two centuries before Christ.''
''This tradition was later amalgamated with Gnostic concepts, such as the Ouroboros, in the Gold-Making of Cleopatra, and the Dialogue of Cleopatra, which describe the working of metals in terms of the death and resurrection of the soul, and the late third century Visions of Zosimos. In Zosimos, the alchemical process is identified with Jesus Christ, who, as''
''the Son of God, became one with Adam, in order to restore him to his place among the Men of Light.''
''The Greek works were translated into Arabic in the ninth century and the theory expanded by Jabir Ibn Hayyan, who stressed the role of mercury, and the qualities of hot, cold, moist, and dry, which were to become the cornerstone of alchemical theory. The simile of marriage for a chemical process first appears in the Turba Philosoporum, a translation of an Arabic work that may have been written as early as 900 AD. Rhases, the great physician, also wrote on alchemical theory, discussing the production of an elixir through a process of coagulation.''
''Avicenna in his work De Congelatione, however, denied the possibility of real transmutation, although he did believe alchemists could make effective imitations. This influenced Albertus Magnus, Vincent of Beauvais and Ramon Lull. However, another work attributed to Avicenna, De Anima in Arte Alchimiae, sup''
''ported transformation, thus enabling the alchemists to dismiss De Congelatione as a blind.''
''Thus, when alchemy entered Europe in the 12th century, the sulfur-mercury theory of metals, the elixir, the color sequence produced during the process, the ferment, the separation and conjunction of elements or qualities, the process of distillation and the analogies of marriage, death, and birth and their mystical interpretation, were all present in Morienus Romanus’ Liber de Compositione Alchemiae, the first Arabic alchemical work to be translated into Latin, by Robert of Chester in 1144. This was followed by Gerard of Cremona’s translation of De Aluminibus et Salibus, attributed to Rhases, and the Aristoteles de Perfecto Magisterio. In the 13th century Vincent of Beauvais, Aquinas, Ramon Lull, and Roger Bacon all discussed alchemy in their encyclopedic works, and after their deaths alchemical works attributed to them began to appear.''

''Material Bonuses for the activity (see below).''

===Alchemical Vis Extraction Lab Total = Creo + Vim + Intelligence + Magic Theory + Aura Modifier + Shape and===


===Material Bonuses===


===Vim Vis Extracted = One-tenth (Round===


===Up) of Vis Extraction Lab Total===

''A Verditius magus may also add his Craft Ability and incorporate Verditius Runes (Philosophiae).''

===Form-specific Vis===

''A magus using Hermetic Alchemy may choose to extract Form-specific vis, but the process is less efficient than extracting Vim vis, and the yield is halved. Technique vis cannot be extracted by this method.''
''To extract Form vis, the magus chooses the shape and material of the object receiving the vis to be appropriate to the desired Form, and the Creo Vim Lab Total is limited by a requisite of the Form desired.''

===Form-specific Vis Extraction Lab Total===


==== Creo + Vim (Form Requisite) + Intelligence + Magic Theory + Aura Modifier + Shape and Material Bonuses===


===Form Vis Extracted = One-twentieth (Round Up) of Vis Extraction Lab Total===


===Choosing Appropriate Shape and Material Factors===

''To determine whether a Shape and Material table Bonus applies for vis extraction, look for a single invested effect that might in principle be instilled in this device and that uses the Form desired. (The object is not being enchanted or opened for enchantment at this stage, but see Philosophic Alchemy).''
''Any component that would add a bonus to this guideline effect can be used to benefit the Lab Total for this extraction. The object can take the form of a compound device (ArM5, page 97) with multiple components, but the total Shape and Material Bonus is limited by the magus’s Magic Theory score.''
''Example: Rufus wishes to extract Vim vis. He considers that Demon’s Eternal Oblivion would be a Vim effect if enchanted, and so a piece of red coral (+10 vs. demons) is appropriate. He has Intelligence +3, Creo 15, Vim 7, Magic Theory 7 and the aura is 5. His Magic Theory is less that the possible bonus from red coral, so limits it. His Lab Total is: Creo 15 + Vim 7 + Int +3 + Magic Theory 7 + aura 5 + bonus (limited by Magic Theory) 7 = 44. Rufus extracts five pawns of Vim''
''vis. (He would only have extracted four pawns without Hermetic Alchemy.)''
''Later he decides he would really like some Ignem vis, but lacks a ready source, so decides to extract some from the aura. He posits a Ward Against Heat and Flames effect, and puts together a piece of fired clay (+4 contain or protect from fire) with a lead seal (+4 wards). The bonus from these is +8, which again exceeds his Magic Theory. His Ignem score is 19, which is greater than his Vim, so his Lab Total is again 44. Extracting Form-specific vis halves the yield to (44/20) rounded up, so he extracts three pawns of Ignem vis.''

==Philosophic Alchemy — Minor and Major Mystery Virtue==

''Philosophic Alchemy builds on Hermetic Alchemy and lets the magus settle the alchemical object into the process so that it digests and ferments on its own, and extract Vim or Form-specific vis from the aura (by Hermetic Alchemy) with little attention from the magus. (This Virtue requires Hermetic Alchemy as a prerequisite.)''
''Alternatively, the magus may process the object to create ready-opened enchantment spaces instead of raw vis. The decision whether to extract vis or create ready-opened spaces is made at the start of the process.''

''An assortment of the following equipment can be found in any Hermetic Alchemist’s lab.''
''Flasks: Ceramic, crystal, or glass con''
''tainers in a variety of shapes, sizes, and thicknesses. Still Heads: Flask lids, with glass pipes''
''leading to other flasks. Cucurbit: A flask with a still head''
''attached. Alembic: A distilling device that looks''
''like a flask with a narrow-necked opening leading down from the top. Pelican: A still with two necks that''
''allow a distilled substance to be returned to its original nature, ready''
''for re-distillation and subsequent further refinement. Philosopher’s Egg: A special retort''
''(similar to an alembic) into which substances are distilled. Eventually the Philosopher’s Stone will be “hatched” from this “egg.” Kerotakis: A closed vessel in which''
''materials such as thick leaves of metal are exposed to vapors in order to distill essences. Funnels: Made of glass, with a selec''
''tion of cloth and charcoal filters. Mortars and Pestles: Made of stone''
''or ceramic, designed for grinding down ingredients. Crystallizing Dishes: Shallow dishes''
''allowing for rapid evaporation.''

''Hermetic Alchemy fills an object with several pawns of vis, but magi often find it useful to have individual pawns of raw vis in separate objects, handy for use when needed. The following spell divides raw vis among several objects.''

===Divide the Gathered Essence===

''ReVi 25 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group Transfers the raw vis from an item into one or more containers. The maga may freely choose how the vis is to be divided.''
''(Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Group)''

|}
''If a maga already has Minor Philosophic Alchemy when she seeks to Initiate the Major Virtue, the new Virtue replaces the old. The “loss” of the Minor Virtue counts as an Ordeal Flaw (loss of a Virtue) for the Initiation.''
''Minor Philosophic Alchemy requires a year (four continuous seasons) of fermentation and digestion before the vis extraction is complete and the vis may be used. Major Philosophic Alchemy allows a more efficient digestion to be established, which is completed in a single season.''

===Automatic Extraction of Vis===

''The magus prepares an object just as he would to extract with Hermetic Alchemy, with the same bonuses, and the same amounts of vis extracted. However, he understands how the process may be settled and left to itself, and may perform other laboratory activities, treating the vis extraction as a seven-day distraction from other lab work. (He can do other things while in the laboratory, such as study from books or vis, even though these are not laboratory activities.) Since the vis extraction proceeds largely by itself, he is not restricted to another activity of the same kind, Technique, and Form. However, he cannot run another vis extraction, not even one that does not use the Virtues of Hermetic Alchemy.''
''He must attend daily to the extraction, so whatever activities he plans must revolve around being in the laboratory. Any distractions from the laboratory are applied to the vis extraction Lab Total as well as any study or lab work running in parallel; if the distractions exceed 20 days, the digestion is spoiled and must be abandoned (ArM5, page 103). (Add the seven-day distraction (for attention to vis extraction) to the other activity only.)''
''Example: Parella starts a Major Philosophic Alchemy vis extraction in her laboratory. She has a Creo Vim Lab Total of 62, plus a bonus 9 (limited by her Magic Theory 9) for the Shape and Material of the device, and hopes to get (71/10 rounded up) eight pawns of Vim vis. She''
''also has a Perdo Mentem Lab Total of 63, and wants to invent a level 30 spell, which she can do in one season while also tending the digesting vis extraction.''
''However, a party of covenant grogs has an unfortunate accident and needs rescuing, and she''
''is called away from her lab for 11 days. This is a 12-point penalty to vis extraction, reducing her Creo Vim Lab Total to 49, so only five pawns of vis are extracted at the end of the season.''
''The 11 days’ absence adds to the seven days’ distraction from spell research (for attending to the vis extraction) and her Perdo Mentem Lab Total is penalized by 18 days or 26 points. Her spell Lab Total is now 63 – 26 = 37. She does not complete the spell, but only accumulates (37 – 30) = 7 points toward inventing it, and threatens to turn the grogs into toads.''

===Time Needed for Automatic Extraction of Vis===

''Minor Philosophic Alchemy requires the process to continue for a complete year. For each of the four seasons, record the Lab Total (less any distractions). At the end of the year, the vis extracted is determined by the lowest of the four Lab Totals. If any season is lost (more than 20 days out of the lab), then the whole extraction is lost, and should be aban''
''doned. (A new extraction can be started in the next season.)''
''A magus may only manage a single vis extraction in any season, whether using alchemical or standard methods. He cannot run two separate laboratories simultaneously and still maintain the magical harmonies necessary for lab work.''
''The magus may not safely experiment while an extraction is digest''
''ing, as the distortions in the aura''
''destabilize the extraction and it''
''will fail.''

===Ready-opened Devices===

''Philosophic Alchemy can produce a device with alreadyopened enchantment spaces. Opening a device for enchantment uses Vim vis, so a Creo Vim vis extraction Lab Total is used. The number of spaces open is equal to the number of pawns of Vim vis that would have been extracted into it as automatic vis extraction. (No vis can be extracted: It is as if Vim vis was extracted and opened into the device at the same time.)''
''An item opened by Philosophic Alchemy is ready for enchantment, or may be opened normally in the season immediately following the alchemical process. The magus opening the device normally need not be an alchemist. A magus may count the already-open spaces either as a bonus on top of what the device could normally contain, or as reducing the pawns of vis required to open the device.''
''Example: Parella repeats her vis extraction in a later season, without distraction, but chooses to settle the object to create open enchantment spaces. Her Lab Total + bonus is 71, so (71/10 rounded up) eight open spaces are created.''
''She is using a small piece of red coral (semiprecious gem, x2 size) that requires 24 pawns of Vim vis to open. Since she has a Magic Theory of 9 she can handle 18 pawns of vis, which is normally not enough to open such a device. However, since eight spaces are already open, she chooses to reduce the vis requirement instead of creating bonus spaces: she only needs 16 pawns of vis — well within her capacity.''
''The Mysteries Revised Edition The Lesser Elixir — Minor Mystery Virtue''
''Alchemists quest for eternal life. Some believe that if only they can create the perfect Longevity Ritual, they can live forever. As a stage along this path they have discovered an improved formula known as the Lesser Elixir of Life.''
''The Lesser Elixir increases the aging bonus of a Longevity Ritual by incorporating additional ingredients. The Lesser Elixir is a personal formula, unique to the magus; unlike a Longevity Ritual, it cannot be created for another.''
''Most magi choose a consumable formula for their Elixir, such as a potion, as they are probably working toward the Great Elixir.''
''The Lesser Elixir requires Hermetic Alchemy.''
''Magi questing for eternal life often also seek to gain the Virtue Unaging (possibly through cult Initiation), as this adds to the seeming of immortality.''

===Creating the Lesser Elixir===

''The magus may invent a Lesser Elixir formula, adding ingredients to his Longevity Ritual, and increasing the modifier of the combined formula.''
''The magus performs his Longevity Ritual and invests the required vis, which prepares a dose of the formula. This may be done even if he has a currently active Longevity Ritual. The magus’s Longevity Ritual may be his own invention or the invention of another magus (such as his parens), but the Lesser Elixir must be the magus’s own work.''
''By spending a season in the laboratory, the magus creates or extends a list of special ingredients. Each time the magus reinvents the Lesser Elixir, he adds an ingredient to the list: each ingredient adds points to a total of Elixir Points. The Elixir Level is determined like an Art, using Elixir Points instead of XP, but may not exceed his Magic Theory when he devises the formula. The Elixir Level is added to the normal Aging Bonus of the base Longevity Ritual.''

===Elixir Points = Total of Points From===


===Extra Ingredients===

''The Elixir Level is determined from Elixir Points, limited by Magic Theory score:''

===Elixir Level Elixir Points===

''1 1''
''2 3''
''3 6''
''4 10''
''5 15''
''6 21''
''7 28''
''8 36''
''9 45''
''10 55''

===Aging Bonus = Longevity Ritual===


===Modifier + Elixir Level===

''The Lesser Elixir replaces the normal Longevity Ritual modifier while the Lesser Elixir remains active.''

===Elixir Points===

''Elixir Points for each ingredient are determined from the Shape and Material Bonuses table, choosing items that are appropriate to the form and function of the potion (Creo, Corpus, longevity, healing, health, and the physical form of the formula), or by qualities of the maga herself (based on her best Arts, or Magical Focus, or whatever best defines her magic — you should discuss this with the storyguide or troupe).''
''Alchemists have an especially close affinity with bonus items they devise personally (by experimenting with Vulgar Alchemy), and the Elixir Points for such items are doubled. No single item may have a bonus exceeding the alchemist’s Magic Theory score.''
''Example: Desperata’s Longevity Ritual was created by her parens, and with her assistance he had a Lab Total of 74, so her Longevity Ritual grants an Aging Bonus of 15.''
''Now 53, she has learned the secret of the lesser Elixir, so she invests another (53/5) = 11 pawns of vis to create a dose of her Longevity Ritual. She adds bloodstone (+4 blood and wounds) as her first special ingredient, so her Elixir Level is 2. Her combined Aging Bonus is 15+2 = 17.''
{|style="border-style: solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: chocolate"
|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|
''When a Longevity Ritual is designed in the laboratory, the enchantment requires one pawn of vis for every five years of age (rounded up). The magus designing the Longevity Ritual can handle twice his Magic Theory in vis in a season-long laboratory activity. This places a ceiling on the age of the magus for whom the potion is designed.''
''When rebrewing the Longevity Ritual after an Aging Crisis (or to prepare a dose as base for the Lesser Elixir), using the Lab Text for the ritual, the process takes no significant investment of time — in practice, it takes about 15 minutes per magnitude of the Lab Text of the Longevity Ritual, as if casting a ritual spell. The limits on the vis handling for this process are those of a magus casting a ritual: Art specific vis is used, limited for each Art by the magus’s Art score.''
''Thus, if the magus obtained a Longevity Ritual formula from a specialist potion brewer, with a bonus set to last him several centuries (in principle), he can rebrew replacement doses for himself without needing to spend his whole life studying Magic Theory.''
''In practice, since the Longevity Ritual itself inflicts Warping Points for a continuing effect, most magi succumb to Final Twilight before the limits of the enchanter’s ability to design aging bonus formulae. Even the extra bonus points awarded by the Lesser Elixir are mostly cosmetic, a stay in the face of the looming end of Twilight.''
''The only way the alchemist can hope to extend their Longevity Potions into true immortality is to discover the secrets of the Great Elixir.''

==Longevity Ritual Vis Limits==


|}
''Some time later, she has reinvented her Lesser Elixir twice more, adding amber (+3 Corpus), and laurel oil (+3 to healing oils, a Vulgar Alchemy bonus devised by herself, so the bonus is doubled). Her Elixir Points are now 3+4+5 (the laurel oil double bonus of 6 is capped by her Magic Theory of 5) = 12, and her Elixir Level is 4. Her Aging Bonus is now 15+4 = 19.''

===Repeating the Lesser Elixir===

''If the magus suffers an Aging Crisis, the Lesser Elixir loses its effectiveness, and must be repeated. He may reperform the Lesser Elixir ritual, taking little more time than repeating the existing Longevity Ritual: first, repeat the Longevity Ritual with a new investment of vis, then add the Lesser Elixir special ingredients.''
''The alchemist may instead reinvent his Lesser Elixir formula at any time, consuming another dose of his Longevity Ritual formula, and a further season in the laboratory. Spending a season reinventing the Lesser Elixir lets the magus add other special ingredients to the list.''

==The Great Elixir — Major Mystery Virtue==

''The ultimate goal — the Elixir of Life — achieved so far by very few alchemists is to transform themselves into beings of magic, truly immortal, although at the cost of the loss of their humanity. This Virtue teaches a method that is itself a form of Mystery Ordeal, creating and consuming a Great Elixir potion.''
''The magus must have both the Virtues Unaging and the Lesser Elixir.''

===Preparing the Great Elixir===

''The magus opens an invested device in the form of a consumable item such as a potion. He also prepares a dose of his Lesser Elixir formula. The Lesser Elixir uses up (Longevity Ritual level/10) enchantment spaces in the Great Elixir device.''
''The magus invests the following as if they were enchantment effects, but based''
''on non-Hermetic rituals. Each time the enchantment is prepared, it is unique to the magus and the dose of Lesser Elixir; if the Great Elixir must be attempted more than once, the Lab Texts from previous attempts only grant similar spell bonus points to the next attempt.''

===Become a Being of Magic===

''MuCo(Vi) 50 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Always On, T: Ind, Mystery Effect''
''If the Great Elixir works, the magus transforms into a being aligned to the Magic realm, making him a magical creature.''
''Note that this is a Mystery Enchantment, outside Hermetic theory, and may not be replicated by those without the Greater Elixir Virtue. Hermetic theory does not in itself possess the ability to transform a human into a being of the Magic realm. It only functions as part of the Elixir ritual, and may not be cast as a spell.''
''(Unique Mystery)''

===Grant Might===

''CrVi, Gen Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Always On, T: Ind, Mystery Effect''
''If the Great Elixir works, the magus gains Magic Might equal to half (effect level–20).''
''Note that this is a Mystery Effect, outside of general Hermetic theory, and may not be replicated by those without the Greater Elixir Virtue. Hermetic theory does not in itself possess the ability to grant Magic Might to a human. It only functions as part of the Elixir ritual, and may not be cast as a spell.''
''(Unique Mystery)''

===Testing the Great Elixir===

''When the potion is complete, the maga drinks it, and tests the Elixir with a roll of:''

===Simple Die + Stamina + Lesser Elixir Level + Reroll Bonus Vs. Ease Factor of===


===(age/10, Round Up)===

''If the maga fails, then she knows that the particular Become a Being of Magic and Grant Might effects attempted did not work for her. However, all is not lost: She merely needs to create another dose of Lesser Elixir (possibly reinvented to include more Elixir Points), and use it to create an alternative Great Elixir potion.''
''The Lab Texts for the previous Great Elixir enchantments give a similar spells bonus of (effect magnitude) to the new Great Elixir effects, but no other benefit. In addition, each attempt at the Great Elixir grants a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll, to a limit of the maga’s Magic Theory.''
''Example: Desperata has studied alchemy for many years, She is 157 years old. She has Stamina +2, Magic Theory 10, and 53 Lesser Elixir Points — an Elixir Level of 9. Her player rolls 4 + Stamina 2 + Lesser Elixir Level 9 = 15 vs. Ease Factor 16 — failure. Desperata curses her bad luck, and plans several seasons more to enchant different effects into her Great Elixir, and then to test the new formula.''

===Success! Effects of the Elixir===

''The magus who succeeds in creating the Greater Elixir ceases to be human, and becomes an immortal, alchemical being of the Magic realm, with a Might score determined by the Great Elixir potion. He may be slain, but he will not die of lesser wounds, nor age or Warping.''
''The transformation is complete and irrevocable, and cannot be dispelled; for example, by trying to dispel the Great Elixir focus — indeed, the focus no longer exists, having been consumed and digested by the magus.''
''See Appendix A: Immortal Magi for description and rules for immortals and immortal magi in particular.''

===Improving the Elixir After Transformation===

''The now-immortal magus may later create a new Great Elixir with an improved Grant Might effect. The magus repeats the process, creating and testing a Great Elixir potion. The Ease Factor to test the potion remains fixed at the age when the magus transformed, as he now does not age. Any cumulative bonus from a previous Elixir process is reset when he starts to make a new Great Elixir.''
''If the new Great Elixir fails the test, the Elixir is wasted, but no other ill effects befall the immortal. The new potion grants a cumulative +1 bonus to testing the Great Elixir until eventually successful, when the magus’s Might improves to that provided by the new Grant Might effect.''
''Example: Desperata finally succeeded four years, and two potions, later (aged 161). Her level 80 Grant Might enchantment gave her a Might Score of 30. Forty years later, she has improved her Arts and wishes to boost her Might further. She creates a fourth Great Elixir potion (with a level 100 Grant Might), beginning a new series of tests. The Ease Factor to test the potion is the same as when she became immortal (161/10 or 17). The roll is Stamina 2 + Lesser Elixir 9 + roll 3 = 14 — failure. Undismayed, she creates another potion and tests this with a +1 bonus: 1+2+9 +roll 9 — success! Her Might Score improves to 40.''

==The Order of the Green Cockerel==

''While the new science of alchemy is still establishing itself in much of Europe, a secret society of Hermetic alchemists meet to discuss the Great Work; not the transmutation of base metal into gold, but the attainment of the Elixir Vitae and eternal life.''

==The History of the Order of the Green Cockerel==

''The Green Cockerel was born out of the reconciliation of alchemy with Hermetic theory by Jahm of Alexandria in 956AD. It received little attention in the Order of Hermes until, in 1144, Roger of Chester published De Compositione Alchemiae, the first Latin work to introduce the ideas of Arabic alchemy to the wider European community. This created a great sensation and a wide spread of interest among mundane, unGifted scholars, and alchemists became common in most large cities as the new science developed.''
''Then a small Hermetic Mystery Cult, patiently working toward the Great Work, the Order of the Green Cockerel was instantly fashionable and popular in Hermetic circles, as more and more magi wished to learn more of the new science. The existing society coped well with the influx of new blood and talent, and has achieved some repute. Its existence is something of an open secret in the Order of Hermes, and members make few efforts to conceal their interests or affiliation with the group.''

==The Order of the Green Cockerel Today==

''The Order of the Green Cockerel is a learned society that studies advances in''
''the new science of alchemy, attempting to reconcile them with Hermetic theory. When members deal with unGifted alchemists, they always don disguise, disassociate themselves as far as possible from the Order of Hermes, and use cryptic hints and demonstrations to encourage development of the mundane science, rather than explicitly explaining the secrets. Its role is to guide and nurture the development of the experimental science of alchemy, not to reveal its secret mysteries.''
''The members of the Green Cockerel, however, have a secret that would possibly cause much consternation among their Hermetic sodales should it ever be revealed: They are in frequent and friendly communication with many wizards of the Islamic world, whose knowledge of alchemy is believed to far exceed that in Mythic Europe. This communication goes beyond the trading of magical secrets, and it is rumored that members of the Green Cockerel have actively worked to prevent crusaders from interfering with cities, or even from setting out, to further their cultivation and protection of their non-Hermetic allies. Many members of the Green Cockerel are frequent visitors to exotic locations in the Levant, North Africa, and Granada. Arabic is taught within the Order of the Green Cockerel, and some high-level texts may only be found in that language; all Green Cockerel texts are highly coded in Hermetic alchemical symbolism to prevent the inadvertent betrayal of the secret mysteries.''
''The Great Convocation of potentially all Initiates is held once every seven years in Alexandria; pressing lab work, however, prevents many from attending. Here new devices, insights, spells, and Shape and Material Bonuses are shared, and a competition is held for the best breakthrough in this period, known as the Fermentation Cycle.''

==Structure of the Order of the Green Cockerel==

''The extent of the Green Cockerel remains a matter for conjecture; what is certain is that mundane alchemy flourishes in the courts and cities of Mythic''
''Europe, although it is still rare in the Novgorod, Hibernian, and Loch Leglean tribunals. The number of members is not known, although it is probably one of the larger Mysteries given the current interest in alchemy among unGifted scholars.''
''What is certain is that the Great Work has only comparatively recently been achieved by the Hermetic method, and probably only once, although some skeptics deny even that. The single Initiate who completed the Great Work is never seen by the members of the Green''
''Cockerel, and is referred to as the Secret Master, although, confusingly, accounts vary greatly from those who have claimed to have met this Initiate as to his actual gender — Secret Mistress may be equally appropriate.''
''The seven degrees of the Order of the Green Cockerel reflect the seven traditional stages of the alchemical process. Each of the degrees is associated with a planet, a color and a metal, and is named for an alchemical symbol. The rich symbolism of the Green Cockerel is some''
''times reflected discretely in the colors and symbols that adorn Initiates’ robes. The actual processes of alchemy are hence reflected in the outer world, as the True Work is not the alchemical processes, but the purging and magical refinement of the spirit of the Initiate, as it prepares him for the Great Work.''

===The Toads===

''The first degree represents the first process: calcination, associated with Saturn, the color black, and the metal lead. The unrefined probationer is exposed to the heat of the Initiation, and learns of the invisible sun, and the influence of the planets. Regarded with awe by mundane alchemists they meet, owing to their great knowledge, Toads are the lowest members of this secret society, their role largely that of lab assistants, as yet unversed in the mysteries. Quests for rare ingredients or alchemical literature are common at this degree. The Initiate learns the Virtue of Planetary Magic.''

===The White Swans===

''The second degree represents the alchemical process of dissolution. It is associated with the planet Jupiter, the color grayish-white, and the metal tin. Now the Initiate is asked to make sacrifices; to dissolve his worldly concerns in the pursuit of the work that she is just beginning. To prove her knowledge, she must add new knowledge to the corpus of alchemical understanding, by creating at least seven new Shape and Material Bonuses before progressing to the next degree of Initiation, in addition to the usual requirements. Using exotic and difficult-to-obtain ingredients found on quests is greatly admired. To assist in this aim, she is Initiated into the Virtue of Vulgar Alchemy.''

===The Green Kings===

''The third degree represents the process of separation, is associated with the planet Mars, the metal iron, and the color green. Note that while red is the traditional color of Mars, green is the complementary color of red; the Initiate seeks to symbolically separate out the “greenness” of his physical “red.” After Initiation the Green King (a term used for males and females of the third degree) removes himself from contact with his alchemical brethren until he is ready to face the fourth-degree Initiation, and does not participate in any rites or Convocation.''
''During this time the Initiate is expected to purge himself of material dross and discover his true potential. The Mystagogue leads the way by Initiating the Virtue Unaging before the exile begins, in a rite designed to purge the Initiate. The principle of elimination of unwholesome and negative personality traits features heavily in this degree, and stories may reflect the attempt to overcome Personality Flaws or Traits through heroic endeavors.''

===The Peacocks===

''This fourth degree represents the process of conjunction, as the now purged and spiritually purified Initiate is rejoined to the Green Cockerel , welcome once more amidst the alchemical community. The planet Venus governs this degree. The metal copper is associated with the Peacocks, and the Initiatess robes bear the splendor of all the colors of the rainbow. They are now expected to serve as active members for the cult, and learn some of the secrets of the Great Work. They are Initiated in the Virtue Hermetic Alchemy.''

===The Unicorns===

''This degree covers the alchemical principle of fermentation. The symbolic planet and metal is Mercury, and the color is the purest white. Unicorns are the ambassadors and emissaries of the cult, and watch over mundane alchemists with a kindly eye, guiding experiments and helping research through veiled hints and cryptic allusions. Now the Great Work begins in earnest, as the Initiate learns the secret of the Virtue Lesser Elixir.''

===The Pelicans===

''The sixth degree is the process of distillation. It is symbolically associated with the Moon, the metal silver, and the color red. Now one learns the true secret of distillation as represented by Initiation into the Virtue Philosophic Alchemy, and takes on the role of Mystagogue and earthly representative of the Order of the Green Cockerel, acting as intermediary between the true spiritual master who has completed the Great Work and the alchemical brethren, mundane and esoteric.''

===The Phoenix===

''The process of the seventh degree is that of coagulation, the planet the Sun, the metal and the color gold. The Initiates now learn the secret of the Virtue Great Elixir, taught by the Secret Master. Should they succeed, they rise like a phoenix, having transformed themselves from base led to alchemical gold, and achieved magical immortality. This is the true secret of alchemy of which mundane alchemy is but the slightest distorted reflection as though seen through a glass darkly.''
