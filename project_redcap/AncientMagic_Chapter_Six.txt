''[T]he ancients also describe as mechanicians the wonder-workers, of whom some work by means of pneumatics, as Heron in his Pneumatica, some by using strings and ropes, thinking to imitate the movements of living things, as Heron in his Automata and Balancings, ... or by using water to tell the time, as Heron in his Hydria, which appears to have affinities with the science of sundials.''
''— Pappus, Book VIII Mathematical Collection''
''Throughout its history, Alexandria has been the crossroads of the eastern Mediterranean. For centuries, the Royal Museum and Library saw scholars from different cultures meet to exchange teaching and knowledge. Heron of Alexandria, who lived there in the first century AD, wrote extensively on mathematics, physics, pneumatics, and mechanics. His studies of metaphysics allowed him to derive certain principles underlying Neo-Platonic theory, which he shared with his best pupils. This led to the formation of a small order of mechanic-magicians, historically known as the Mechanicians, or wonder-workers of Heron.''
''According to Heron, all mechanical devices possess both a theoretical and a manual part, the theoretical part being composed of the necessary geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, and physics required to design it, and the manual component being the metalwork, architecture, carpentry, or painting necessary to build it.''
''The Mechanicians infused mechanical devices with wondrous abilities through the marriage of these two parts. Among the most famous of these “mechanica” were an exquisite singing nightingale belonging Justinian the Great, and an automated puppet show which portrayed the lives of gods and men, fabricated by Heron himself.''
''The Mechanicians spread throughout the eastern Empire but the majority of them remained in Alexandria, taking advantage of its Library and Museum. They remained a rarity, as their magic required both considerable funds and a prohibitively high level of education. As Christianity grew in power, the Neo-Platonic scholars who formed the group’s core practitioners became the targets of persecution that further reduced their numbers. The Mechanicians died out sometime during the fifth century. Theon and his daughter Hypatia, both prominent figures during the Library of Alexandria’s final years, were among the last known members.''
''Much of their knowledge was lost during the fourth century when the Byzantine Empire suppressed Heron’s works as a pagan heresy. Ironically, the Church subsequently embraced Heron’s surviving works centuries later, just as it did those of Aristotle and many other ancient philosophers. This allowed many of his works to survive, preserving some of the Mechanicians’ lore.''

==Adding to the Library==

''Heron’s secrets are unknown to the Order of Hermes large. If magi think of him at all, they assume that Heron’s works are mundane philosophical treatises and that rumor of his magical constructs are just that — rumor. Magi with access to uncorrupted copies of Heron’s texts can use them to rediscover his secrets and incorporate them into Hermetic theory. Troupes not wishing to include mechanica in their game may still use his texts in stories, as Heron’s teachings played an important part in medieval learning.''

==Books==

''Heron’s writings are useful summae and tractatus on the Artes Liberales and Philosophiae, particularly on the principles of geometry, astronomy, and mathematics. Few scribes transcribing the ancient scrolls possessed the Supernatural Virtue Mechanica of Heron, however, which rendered these copies worthless for researching mechanica (see below).''
''Several other Neo-Platonic writers such as Apollonius and Theon were Mechanicians of Heron, and their works might also contain clues''

=Heron of Alexandria’s=


|}
''that help integrate Heron’s teachings into Hermetic theory.''

==Relics of Empire==

''Mechanica were always a rarity, but discovering one in the 13th century is not impossible, as they have considerable value as art objects. The practice died out nearly a thousand years ago and the majority of mechanica are even older, making the likelihood of any mechanica still being in working order very small. Merchants or scholars might try to sell a broken one to a covenant as a curiosity. While repairing such devices is impossible without the Mechanica of Heron Virtue, study reveals that these items possess an intricate magic that hints of new potentials in Hermetic theory.''

==House Politics==

''Several Houses might be very interested in rediscovering Heron’s techniques and incorporating them into Hermetic theory. Naturally, the Bonisagus would be fascinated with the possibilities — especially the creation of sentient magical devices. The magus discovering a way to imbue an item with intelligence as Heron’s followers did would reap instant fame.''
''House Verditius maintains a virtual stranglehold on the creation of automata and complex magical devices in the Order. Heron’s mechanica would be of great interest to them, both to preserve their monopoly and to incorporate his techniques into their own repertoire. A method of producing devices with less vis would be a godsend to the House just as devices with a mutable nature would be a dire threat. Heron’s methods for creating magical items and automata''
''are unrelated to those used by the House (Houses of Hermes: Mysteries, page 128). Combining the two traditions may prove fruitful — or be utterly impossible.''
''The military possibilities of mechanica are not lost on House Tremere. Heron’s devices are supremely versatile, possessing an otherwise unknown flexibility. Such properties make them very useful for supporting extended operations.''

==Heron’s Art: Mechanica==

''A new Major Supernatural Virtue, Mechanica of Heron, represents the magical techniques described in this chapter. A surviving practitioner of this discipline could teach it to a Gifted character using the rules for learning Supernatural Abilities (see ArM5, page 166). Since any magus must subtract his Art scores from the Study Total, any magi seeking to use these techniques would be wiser to attempt integrating Heron’s mechanical principles into Hermetic theory instead.''

==Integrating Heron’s Mechanica into Hermetic Theory==

''A magus attempting to incorporate the underlying principles of Heron’s Mechanica into Hermetic theory requires a breakthrough in Hermetic theory (see the Introduction). Integrating Heron’s Mechanica requires the following two suggested Breakthroughs: Mutable Device and Awakened Device.''
''Before starting, the magus must obtain uncorrupted versions of Heron’s texts and working mechanica. Studying these provides the magus with Insight and provides a one-time bonus to the magus’s Lab Total when inventing a Hermetic device that mimics the effects of either a studied mechanica or a mechanica described in one of Heron’s texts. Mechanica provide a bonus equal to the magnitude of the device’s effect. Uncorrupted texts provide a bonus equal to their Level or Quality (whichever is lower) for inventing a device described in the text. Broken mechanica do not provide Insight. An anima may provide several instances of Insight (one for each of its effects) or serve as a Teacher (see the Introduction) at the storyguide’s discretion.''

===Understanding Mechanica===

''A magus may wish to use a mechanica as well as study it. The magus spends one season in the laboratory investigating the device as per the Investigating Enchantments rules (ArM5, page 100). If the study total generated exceeds the level of the effect in the device, the magus understands the device sufficiently to use the device in addition to it possibly providing the researcher with Insight.''

''Heron’s disciples used this Virtue to create and animate magicalmechanical devices called mechanica. The character with this Virtue must have The Gift and possess a Virtue that allows access to Academic Abilities. He begins with a score of 1 in the Ability Mechanica of Heron. The Ability can be improved by study, practice, or teaching. Mechanica can simulate any Creo, Rego, Perdo, or Muto effect on Auram, Aquam, Ignem, Mentem, or Terram. Ordinary mechanica may not have more than one effect, but awakened mechanica (see below) may have several.''
''Creating a mechanica requires a season or more of work in a laboratory after which the Mechanician matches his Intelligence + Mechanica of Heron Ability against a Mechanica Creation Level of (3 x the number of magnitudes of effect in the device). Mechanicians may also add the lower of the Philosophiae or Artes Liberales abilities to the total. They may also receive benefits for Inventive Genius, and make use of Arcane Experimentation (see ArM5, pages 107–109). Frequency of use, Penetration, triggers, and conditions (see ArM5, pages 97–98) can be used to modify the imbued effect and also affect its final magnitude. Mechanica are normally human-sized or larger. Making one small enough to be easily carried increases the Mechanica Creation Level by 3, or by 6 if the item is small enough to hold in one hand. The Mechanica Creation Level decreases by 3 if the device is wagon or boat-sized. Mechanica effects that require additional time to employ reduce the Mechanica Creation Level by 3. (These take 15 minutes per mag''
''nitude of effect to employ as per the Ceremonial Casting rules on ArM5, page 83.) These reductions can never reduce the Creation Level below 3. If the total exceeds the Mechanica Creation Level, the character has successfully created the item. Failure (due to experimentation, for example) indicates that time and half the materials are lost. Auras affect mechanica and their construction as per magical devices (see ArM5, page 187).''

''One of the advantages of mechanica is their flexibility. With a week’s study, a Mechanician can alter a mechanica’s effect so long as it uses the same Form and Technique originally contained in the device. The new level of spell or effect cannot be higher than the existing one (including modifications for range, charges, or use). Changing the device’s function costs the Mechanician one Mythic Pound to attempt and requires a successful Intelligence + Mechanica of Heron roll against an Ease Factor equal to the creation level of the new item.

''of 9 plus the magnitude of the device’s potential Magical Might. As with Mechanica, a lab is required and auras affect the process. If the total is insufficient, the Mechanician may continue to work for another season, adding a cumulative +1 bonus to his total for each further season.

A number of points equal to the magnitude of its Magic Might may be used to modify these traits as per character creation ArM5, page 30. If the base creature does not possess Intelligence, it gains Intelligence +0. At least one Personality Trait is gained based on the form or material of the anima’s body (see ArM5, page 110) as part of the new creature’s personality — these cost nothing and range from –3 to +3. For example, a golden owl might have the Wise or Greedy Personality Traits. Once awakened,''
''the anima can learn Abilities, including languages, as per the rules for training and instruction (ArM5, page 163–166).''
''Anima are not capable of movement or speech on their own and must have these abilities instilled as constant effects. A number of effects can be instilled in a simulacrum equal to the limits dictated by the Material and Size Table (based on the equivalent size) in ArM5, page 97. Naturally, the effect must be logical and the simulacrum capable of carrying it out. For example, a turtle makes a poor runner and a fish could not fly. The imbued locomotion powers for any sentient mechanica will in practice be a Rego Terram effect of level 20 or 25 (base = 2 or 3 , +2 metal, +1 concentration; +5 self-concentrating; +10 unlimited uses) depending on whether the movement is considered “unnatural” or “highly unnatural.” As such, they generally have a level of 12 or 15. Powers may be drawn from those used by automata in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 129. These powers are invested according to the rules for investing a single power in a non-sentient mechanica, above.''
''The anima are often bound their creator as a part of their construction and have a Loyal +3 Personality Trait, but this is not required. Most feel gratitude for their awakening and happily serve their creator. Anima are not subject to fatigue. Anima cannot be made into familiars.''

''Once an Insight Lab Text is created, the magus can begin the process''
''of integration with Hermetic theory by devising enchanted items which Hermetically duplicate the mechanica’s effects. Though a magus cannot create an Awakened Device prior to making the requisite Breakthrough, duplicating the functions of mechanica (which need not be awakened devices) are acceptable sources of breakthrough points for this.''
''Incorporating the Mechanicians’ ability to build enchanted devices without vis breaks the Lesser Limit of Creation (ArM5, page 80), requiring a Hermetic Breakthrough to achieve.''

''The easiest way to recover Heron’s legacy is through recovering surviving written works and devices. Examination of mechanica reveals clues as who fabricated the device and where. Libraries with corrupted copies of Heron’s works may know about the original copies. Armed with these hints, a determined magus can begin his quest for Heron’s lost magic.''

''A mutable item is created like a Lesser Enchanted Device with the new Mutable Device property adding +10 to the device’s level of effect. If applicable, the Lab Total gains bonuses from the item’s shape and material (see ArM5, page 110). Any magus with the Craft Mutable Device Virtue can subsequently alter the device’s enchantment at need. With a week’s work in the laboratory and the expenditure of a pawn of Vim vis, he can alter the device’s invested effect to another one having the same Form and Technique. Any modifications such as conditions or uses per day may also be changed so long as the final level of effect remains the same or lower (including the +10 for the Mutable Device property). For example, a wand instilled with Heat of the Searing Forge, used continually, could be altered to one containing Flash of the Scarlet Flames, usable 12 times per day with a +5 Penetration.''

===Constantinople: The Ruined Metropolis===

''Once the greatest city in the world, Constantinople has fallen upon hard times. Entire districts stand abandoned or destroyed. Everywhere the traveler looks, the effects of the Fourth Crusade are plain to see. Crusader nobles and Italian merchants have seized ancient homes and villas for their own. These foreigners might be persuaded to sell their “old Roman junk,” such as broken mechanica or unread books, to magi. With luck, magi may find themselves obtaining treasures of ancient literature for a pittance of what they might pay in the book-poor West.''

''Bertrando has no compunctions about using the legate’s power for his own ends. Should he become aware of the magi’s true nature, he changes his tune and quickly trades it for a trifling magical favor —a “bargain” which may come back to haunt the magi.''
''Written in the book’s margins is an eyewitness account of Hypatia of Alexandria’s burial; how she was laid to rest next to her father, Theon of Alexandria, in one of that city’s many Temples of Serapis, along with many codices and scrolls salvaged from the Library of Alexandria. The account contains enough information to locate the temple.''

''News of the magi’s investigations makes its way to the ears of Basil the Leprous, the uncrowned king of Constantinople’s innumerable beggars. Basil sets a trap for the magi, sending one of his followers to approach the magi. He claims to know about one of the “jeweled toys” they seek and can even describe Justinian’s Nightingale accurately.''
''The beggar leads those following him into a ruined district where a large group of bandits lie in ambush. The beggar does not know about the ambush and the bandits consider him expendable. Accompanying the bandits is the beggar king and his prize possession, Justinian’s Nightingale. Basil is convinced that these scholars can change base metals into gold and he intends to take them prisoner until they make him rich! The Nightingale has convinced the outlaw that his ragged followers are more than a match for some “harmless alchemists.”''

''powers. It had been intending to simply flee and seek out the company of scholars and philosophers, but the magi’s appearance piques its curiosity. If any of the magi can knowledgeably discourse on philosophy or natural history, they may have a friend for life.''

===Alexandria===

''The Fifth Crusade raged across Egypt and Crusader armies captured Damietta in 1219. They remain there until their defeat in 1221. Crusaders do not return to Egypt until 1249 and the Seventh Crusade.''
''Alexandria may shock magi coming from the small cities and isolated covenants of Mythic Europe. Alexandria sprawls over several square miles of mud brick and stone. Like Constantinople, however, its population has diminished from its heyday to a “mere” 50,000. A vast fortress, the Citadel, built on the site of the Ptolemaic palace (and the Library of Alexandria), overlooks the city, and numerous madrasas (religious colleges) have made the city one of the great centers of Islamic teaching.''
''One of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Lighthouse of Alexandria still guides visitors arriving by ship to the harbor. The markets are a babble of unfamiliar languages. Goods arrive from as far away as India making pepper, silk and other rarities in Mythic Europe comparatively common. On a darker note, many of the unfortunates from the Children’s Crusade of 1212 were sold here as slaves and still labor in the city.''
''Numerous difficulties beset those searching for Hypatia’s tomb. Those without knowledge of the local languages (Arabic and Coptic), or of the city itself, must hire translators and guides. Without disguises, magi risk''

''discovery as “Frankish spies.” Blatant displays of magic bring them to the attention of Muslim scholars or sorcerers who may desire the contents of the temple for themselves. As befitting a major center of Islamic teaching, the Dominion is strong throughout the city, with an average aura of four. It is far higher around the numerous mosques, schools, and mausoleums.''

===Hypatia of Alexandria===

''Hypatia was born in 370 AD, daughter of Theon, who was one of the last librarians at the Royal Library and Museum of Alexandria and a man widely considered one of the most educated in Alexandria. He trained Hypatia in the philosophical arts as well as in Heron’s magical technique and she soon surpassed him in wisdom. As she grew older, Hypatia became a well-known lecturer at the Library of Alexandria and wrote several important treatises on astronomy, astrology, and mathematics. Some credit her with the invention of the astrolabe.''
''Hypatia’s scholarly prominence accented the fact that she was both female and pagan in an increasingly Christian patriarchal society. Shortly before her death, Saint Cyril became the Patriarch of Alexandria, and soon overthrew the Imperial government in the city. In the spring of 415 AD, a mob seized Hypatia on the street, beat her, skinned her with oyster shells, and dragged her body through the city in triumph.''
''After her death, her followers laid her to rest next to her father in the Temple of Serapis where they had lived and studied. The surviving Mechanicians had used the temple as a repository for what they could salvage from the wreckage of the Library. They then fled Alexandria before the mob could seize them, leaving behind a treasure trove of ancient lore. Over the years, the Dominion in Alexandria grew more powerful until it subsumed the temple’s weakened magical aura. However, instead of being snuffed out, the temple’s aura formed a regio that can only be accessed while the Dominion is weak.''
''The Lost TempleLibrary of Serapis''
''Hints and clues lead investigators to the supposed location of the tomb. The ancient Temple of Serapis where Hypatia and Theon lived is long since gone. Mud brick houses cover the temple grounds completely. Mixed into the brickwork are chunks of pillar and stonework taken from the destroyed temple. Questioning those living nearby brings forth a ghastly litany of hauntings and disappearances. Many describe a hideous, skinless apparition who howls curses in an unknown tongue (which turns out to be Ancient Greek). The local holy men have been able to do nothing.''
''Investigation of the area with Intellego spells determines that a regio might have existed here, but the local Dominion overwhelms any lingering magical aura. Weakening''
''The Library of Alexandria was actually several libraries and museums in the city of Alexandria. By the 1220s, it had achieved a mythic stature through the recovered works of ancient writers. The apocryphal burning of the Library during Julius Caesar’s invasion was described as the greatest calamity of the ancient world. In reality, the Library and its scholarly community continued to flourish after the Romans took control. However, the Library suffered from the vicissitudes that beset the Roman Empire, and from Alexandria’s endemic mob violence. Slowly, the Library''
''declined in importance, especially after Theodosius I had its most important complex, the Serapeum, razed as a pagan temple in the fourth century.''
''During the early fifth century, the city of Alexandria fell under the control of Cyril, the Patriarch of Alexandria. At his instigation, the Alexandrian mob burned most of the surviving Library and murdered Hypatia, its last librarian. This marked the end of Alexandria as a major center of ancient learning. Alexandria fell to Arab conquerors in 686, but by then even the Library’s ruins had disappeared.''

''Failing this realization, spells to detect ghosts or magical beings may''
''reveal when the haunt reappears. Although such spells do not help unless the Temple of Serapis is accessible, at those times the spells readily lead to the gate of the old temple.''

''Hypatia, one of the last Librarians of Alexandria, created the Nightingale from gold, silver, and jewels. Designed as a companion and entertainer, the awakened mechanica’s beautiful voice enthralled all who listened to its jewel-like tones. The nightingale watched over Theon and his household, waking them with a clarion voice when fire or robber threatened.''
''After Hypatia’s murder, the bird came to the attention of Emperor Justinian and became a toy used to entertain the Imperial court. Centuries went by as the bird passed from hand to hand, until it was lost during the sack of Constantinople.''
''The nightingale can tell much of Heron’s lore, but it lacks The Gift and the proper understanding of magical theory necessary for it to be able to pass on the secrets of mechanica. It has seen much during its centuries of existence and knows much about the truths behind Byzantine history. The Nightingale loves philosophical debate and can discourse for hours upon Plato and Aristotle.''
''After centuries of being treated as little more than a pet, the Nightingale has grown very lonely for the kind of scholastic discourse it enjoyed with its creator and his family. The beggar king’s rather foolish scheme is the result of the Nightingale’s manipulation.''

===Entering the Temple===

''The entrance to the lost temple is a shadow of its former glory. Built into the wall of a rickety tenement is the lintel of the destroyed temple. The pale granite slab is inlaid with worn Greek and Egyptian carvings praising Serapis and promising dire penalties to those who profane what lies under his protection. Examination by anyone with Magic Lore, Magic Theory, or Mechanica of Heron might discover (Ease Factor of 6) that the stone was once part of a much larger mechanica.''
''When the Dominion aura dips below 4, the doorway to the Temple''
''of Serapis appears as a ghostly archway of shadows beneath the lintel. Characters can enter the regio automatically if they carry a mechanica or bear signs of the Cult of Serapis. Alternatively, characters can enter the regio as described by the rules on page 189 of ArM5. The Dominion aura strength stays below 4 for only a few hours and then returns to normal, trapping anyone inside until the next ill-omened night, which may not be for weeks or months.''

===The Lost Temple of Serapis===

''The temple exists in a small level 4 Magic regio, which contains only the temple’s interior. The temple’s layout is classically simple. Four eternal braziers, one in each corner, fill the central room, or cella, with a flickering red light. As is common with Roman-style temples, the cella stands upon a masonry podium with two rows of pillars inside. Looming over the altar at the far end of the temple is a ten-foot-tall statue of Serapis. The statue gleams in the light from the gold covering its muscular frame, and his bearded face glares down at these intruders.''
''Behind the statue hangs a velvet curtain leading to the sacred chamber, the adyton, where the priests performed secret rituals. Scattered around the cella are numerous books and scrolls, pulled from the innumerable pigeonholes and racks lining the walls. Several rooms lie beneath the cella, entered through a narrow staircase.''
''With a hiss of hydraulics, the great temple doors slam shut behind characters who enter, and the ghost of Hypatia manifests, dripping blood and cackling. Exiting the regio before the Dominion rises once more may prove impossible while Hypatia exists.''
''The temple has many devices that Hypatia can use against intruders with her Command Mechanica Power.''

===Statue of Serapis===

''The statue of Serapis stands over ten feet tall and is made of ivory plates cunningly fitted together over a brass frame. It depicts a Zeus-like figure dressed in a tunic with a magnificent beard. Gold foil and silver inlay covers much of the statue. The statue contains a powerful Theurge’s Trumpet (see above) and Hypatia uses it upon intruders immediately. This mechanica is capable of sounding every ten rounds. The flickering shadows and flexible construction of the statue make it appear to move slightly but it is otherwise inert. Anyone desecrating or plundering it finds that Serapis takes an interest in him in the future.''

==Serapis==

''Serapis was a hybrid god whose worship unified the cults of several Egyptian and Hellenistic deities. Ptolemy I introduced him at the beginning of the Ptolemaic Period in Egypt, though Serapis’s legacy lasted well into the Roman period. He became the Egyptians’ supreme god, embodying the principles of divine authority and the sun, with power over fertility, the afterlife, and healing. Serapis formed a bridge between Greek and Egyptian religions so that both peoples could find common ground in their worship. Through the Ptolemaic Pharaohs and their Roman successors, Serapis was patron and protector of the Royal Library and Museum and many of its buildings were temples sacred to him.''
''While Serapis is a being of faerie, his temples are often magical sites due to the practices of the Mechanicians and other scholars who dwelt there. The temple where Hypatia and her father lived is one such location.''

===The Victors’ Spoils===

''Should the magi defeat Hypatia, they gain a great treasure in ancient wisdom but they must make haste to leave before they are trapped. Many of the scrolls scattered around the temple are Heron’s works, including uncorrupted copies of Pneumatica and Mechanica (Quality 10 each). Also present are a dozen broken mechanica of various sorts. Even if the magi cannot repair them, each is worth several Mythic Pounds for their material.''
''The pediment beneath the temple contains the rooms now entombing Theon and Hypatia. In her rage, the ghost destroyed almost all of the hundreds of scrolls and tablets stored there. Other relics of the Library of Alexandria might have survived her wrath, however, ready for diligent magi to piece them back together.''
''In addition to whatever survives the battle, one other treasure awaits discovery. In the adyton (sacred chamber) is Heron’s Theater, one of the greatest mechanica ever constructed.''

===Heron’s Theater===

''The automated theater was Heron’s greatest masterpiece. Properly attuned and prepared, it shows its own stories, casting its figurines into a variety of roles and scenes. When started, the theater’s stage doors open and miniature figures act out dramatic events accompanied by sound effects. Ostensibly powered by knot''
''ted strings with weights, it has a surprising tendency to improvise stories on its own. Those studying the theater might be particularly disturbed by the appearance of figurines resembling themselves in these spontaneous plays. Careful examination of these new plays may give inklings of events that have not yet come to pass.''
''This device would fascinate any magi who seek a method of breaking the Hermetic Limit of Time.''

===The Web of Mnemosyne===

''InIm 60 Pen +20, 1/month R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Group Once per month, Heron’s Theater can predict the future of someone associated with it. The target must be among those watching the play, and the effects last for the duration of the play, which usually takes about an hour. The effect is non-Hermetic and apparently breaks the Limit of Time. As such, investigating it is remarkably difficult.''
''The play is often highly allegorical, based on the mythic figures and archetypes available in the theater’s assembly of puppets and figurines. Interpreting what a play means might''
''be an adventure in itself as characters consult with scholars, seers, and holy men.''

==Complications==

''While searching for the surviving remnants of Heron’s magic, Seekers''
''may come into conflict with others who have business with Heron or Hypatia.''

===Magi of Constantinople===

''Several covenants of the Tribunal of Thebes maintain contacts or demesnes in Constantinople. These magi take a proprietary interest in the city and anyone venturing into it. One covenant, Michaels’ Tabula, has actually established their covenant in an abandoned mithraeum in one of the city’s many ruined districts. Currently, the covenant numbers about a half-dozen magi, mostly from House Jerbiton. Long-time residents of Constantinople, they have little love for “Franks,” or any magi hailing from the kingdoms responsible for the destruction of “the City.”''
''If this covenant discovers the investigating magi, they demand first rights to any mechanica and texts found in the city. This is a flagrant violation of the Peripheral Code, but the magi are presumably far from home and on this covenant’s home ground. If friendly relations can be established, the magi of Michaels’ Tabula may trade any Heronic texts or mechanica they have obtained over the years for vis or assistance in dealing with interloping Crusaders. Displaying such an interest in these “worthless” items may pique the inter''

|}
''est of other magi in Heron’s teachings. The Seekers may find themselves with a race to uncover Hypatia’s tomb on their hands.''

===The Shadhali Brotherhood===

''Near the site of the ruined temple is the humble madrasa of the Shadhali Brotherhood. Ahmed Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi teaches Sufi mysticism to his followers here. The Shadhaliyyah are aware of the tomb as an ancient pagan temple and that the area about it is haunted. The have no other idea of its significance. Should they learn of the site’s association with the Library of Alexandria, they may wish to take charge of such dangerous information. These mystics can prove dangerous should the magi provoke them with displays of devilish powers, or harm innocents while in Alexandria. Aside from their impressive martial skills, the Brotherhood wields great influence throughout all levels of the city.''
''The Sufi view magicians as prideful deniers of the will of God, but''
''if approached humbly they might tell what little they know. For more information on the Sufi sect of Islam, see Realms of Power: The Divine, page 112.''
''The Dominion aura surrounding the madrasa has an impressive strength of 8, as its mosque contains the tombs of the Brotherhood’s founder and several other holy mystics.''

==Ramifications for the Order of Hermes==

''Successfully integrating Heron’s teachings into Hermetic theory results in some dramatic effects. The most important is a significant loss in wealth and status for House Verditius. With the advent of Mutable Devices, magi have less need for numerous magical devices. As a result, fewer magi purchase such devices from the House. The Order as a whole benefits as individual magi gain power and flexibility. The smaller covenants particularly benefit from this change, given their poorer resources. House''
''Verditius may try to suppress or destroy knowledge of the Mutable Device technique or try to make it a House monopoly through legal means. House Verditius has considerable political capital and this may be enough of an occasion for them to use it.''
''While the techniques for Awakened Devices remain incompatible with the techniques for creating automata, Awakened Devices make excellent familiars and minions for those able to pay for their construction. Only the richest covenants and groups can afford them. If subsequent research integrates Awakened Devices with the existing automaton-crafting techniques, then the Verditius gain the ability to craft tremendously powerful magical servitors.''
''The heroic magus able to integrate the Mechanicians’ ability to create magical devices without the use of vis would change the face of the Order completely, but doing so would require a Hermetic Breakthrough — assuming it were even possible.''
