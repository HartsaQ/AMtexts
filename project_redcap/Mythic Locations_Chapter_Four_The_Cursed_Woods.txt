''In a desolate and barren valley in Pomerania, a dark and forbidding forest rises from the wilted grass. Under perpetually dark clouds, the old, looming trees whisper words of warning in the wind. For generations this place has been known as truly cursed. No sane traveler passes within sight of this place, and not even the most desperate outlaw dares seek refuge here. This information was sufficient to pique the curiosity of Regulus ex Tytalus. Being ambitious as well as promising, he set off to meet the challenge and test himself, and that is the last record of him that exists.''

==History and Rumors==

''The valley of the Cursewood has never been settled, has never been an important route, nor has it ever been explored fully. It is ignored by people in authority since it has no strategic value or resources. The region even has much better wild areas for expansion. The common people believe the place is cursed, and a multitude of stories can be heard told in whispered voices, behind barred doors, around the safety of the hearth. While it is nominally placed in the Rhine Tribunal it could be moved almost anywhere else with little change (see later). The real and full story of the place is something very few know and even fewer share, but it is included here for reference. Almost a century ago, Regulus discovered the cursed forest and went to investigate, and after several trips to the dark place with almost disastrous consequences he began to''
''understand: The Cursewood was home to a powerful daimon called Wyzwanie (Polish for “challenge”) residing there as a genius loci and fiercely protecting the place. The daimon is not simply trying to kill or drive off intruders, only those of weak will and without sufficient determination. Such a test, a challenge, spoke very much to Regulus’ Tytalean nature. The daimon was something to fight and to deal with, to reach an accord with and gain access to what it was protecting. Regulus also realized that conquering the Cursewood would gain him not only power and glory, but also valuable resources and a place in which to reside and from which to further his own ambitions. He built his sanctum here and intended to found a covenant and build a Mystery Cult based on Wyzwanie. Unfortunately he did not enjoy his victory for long, and only touched the tip of the potential there. Back in his first years postGauntlet he had fought the demon Terentia and her diabolist followers, and his achievements caused a great setback for their evil plot. Terentia’s followers subsequently found an infernal artifact that they had been seeking for centuries. They saw the opportunity for revenge, and mustered an army to take the artifact to attack Regulus in the Cursewood. Many of the infernalists fell to Wyzwanie’s attacks, but the remaining diabolists got close enough to slay Regulus. His mortally wounded body was strung up by the feet from a tree where he was left to die. The grisly murder caused the creation of an Infernal aura which encroached on the Magic aura, fed by the evil of the artifact. The daimon decided the device needed to be hidden and took it upon himself to protect it, by enveloping it with an aspect of itself. Regulus’ encampment and the''
''infernal artifact were immediately withdrawn into a newly formed magic regio. The artifact pained Wyzwanie, even encased in stone, and so he decided that he would reward with his friendship the worthy challenger who could destroy the device. It would now take even more effort to impress him. For a time the infernalists tried to gain access to the regio, and their diabolical acts caused the infernal influence to rise steadily, but in the end Wyzwanie’s harassment forced their retreat. Wyzwanie still resides in the woods but is tormented by the demonic taint, his original curse now seasoned with spite and malice.''

==Variant: Shades of Grey==

''As an alternative, Regulus’ early dealings with the diabolists might have been more amiable. Being ambitious, callous, and overconfident, he was certain he could withstand the temptations of the demons and merely reap the rewards they offered him. He believed he needed the infernal gifts and powers to win Wyzwanie over, and once he had succeeded the demon Terentia came to collect her prize. But Regulus retained a single shred of reason and dignity — perhaps his time spent with the woodland spirit brought him to his senses — and he refused to cross the last threshold to outright diabolism. Terentia exploded in anger, and in the ensuing fight Regulus was killed. The fact that Regulus dealt with demons is considered Uncommon Knowledge (see sidebar, earlier). It should keep the player magi on their toes, making them wary of any treasure found. The basic challenge and story of the Cursewood remains unchanged, unless''

|]
''the storyguide wishes all the treasures and artifacts to be tainted and potentially dangerous.''

==Introducing the Cursewood into the Saga==

''The Cursewood is introduced as a focus for an investigation, and the preparation for and execution of one or more expeditions. Many Tytali are immediately drawn to the story, but the infernal connection as well as the wild and untamed lands serve as hooks to interest a great many more magi if the mere promise of vis isn’t sufficient. It is vital that magi venturing here have an idea about what to look for and where.''

==Proxy Votes==

''This hook works for magi with close connections to the Quaesitores. A magus may allow another to vote for him at Tribunal by proxy and by lending his voting sigil. It seems Regulus ex Tytalus proxied his vote''
''to a Mara ex Miscellana over a century ago, who after her retirement passed Regulus’ vote on to her filia Stanica. Quaesitors regularly need to check up on these matters and would very much like to know whether Regulus is still alive. In the Rhine Tribunal, his sigil will be granted to a Master or Archmagus if he is shown to be dead, as is the custom. Such characters start from the section Investigating the Cursewood, later.''

==The Infernal Connection==

''Things can also start from the infernal aspect of Cursewood. The demon Terentia and her followers are still active, and news of this could reach the player magi, or they could be targeted directly. Investigating the demon soon leads to mention of Regulus; see the section Investigating the Cursewood found later. Regulus, and the parentes of the player magi, may be implicated in diabolism, or it may be apparent that the characters are in a race against time and the diabolists to prevent some great evil.''

==The Tytalean Red Herring==

''If one or more of the player magi are from House Tytalus, or if they are well-versed in the history of this controversial Founder, the story of a magus Tytalus going to a supernaturally affiliated forest and never heard from again easily''

[|

==What is Known of Regulus==

''At the first mention of Regulus or the Cursewood, players roll Intelligence + Organization Lore: Order of Hermes (or alternatively [Regulus’ home covenant] instead). Apply a +3 modifier for magi trained at Regulus’ covenant, or whose parens are descendants of Regulus’ covenant mates. Magi trained outside the Rhine Tribunal suffer a –3 modifier to the roll.''
''Known by All''
''• Regulus was a member of House Tytalus who he lived about a century ago.''
''Widely Known''
''• He was building a Mystery Cult to''
''do with using the powers of spirits to work the elements, or knowledge of Hermetic elemental Forms to command spirits. • Which covenant he was a member of (this varies depending on the saga).''
''Uncommon Knowledge''
''• About a century ago, the magus Regulus ex Tytalus set off to investigate the Cursewood, and was never heard from again. This may sound like the final demise of Tytalus the Founder, and the storyguide may use this as a deliberate red herring if desired. • He fought diabolists just after his Gauntlet. • He registered the Cursewood as a vis source.''
''• He never engaged in any known criminal acts. • He was on the verge of a big discovery. Sources indicate that he would gain a high aura, vis sources, seclusion and protection, as well as inexhaustible sources for the study of magic, at the price of accepting a challenge from the Cursewood.''
''Lost Secrets''
''• The exact details outlined at the beginning of this section about the daimon, what Regulus found in the Cursewood, what he did with it, and what caused his demise are not known by any living person. However, elements of the account can be used to provide further evidence and clues if necessary.''

==Definitions of Spirits==

''Airy Spirits are defined in Realms of Power: Magic as magical spirits of flora, fauna, natural elements, and even abstract phenomena such as emotions or sounds. Their powers and personalities are appropriate to the Hermetic Form they associate with, and they are basically a weak type of spirit. More powerful are the genii loci or spirits of place, which are a more powerful subset of the Airy Spirits who embody and represent a specific place. In the Rhine Tribunal the forest spirits are an example of these, but a genius loci may also reside in a hill, a lake, or the western wind. Even more powerful are the daimons, which are spirits living entirely in the Magic Realm that interact with the mundane world through aspects. The daimon can retract this aspect and send a new one at will, so that killing one has little meaning. Except, perhaps, for angering the daimon.''

|]
''sparks ideas. Why does this sound so much like the Founder’s end? Is it merely a story fed by this myth? Did Regulus know something important and stage the situation? Was he really Tytalus returned in disguise? A player magus with a Tytalus rival could find himself lured into doing the hard work of penetrating the Cursewood, with the rival waiting to reap the benefits. In Pomerania, in the eastern marches of the Rhine Tribunal, bordering on Novgorod, the lands are covered in mighty forests and the population is very sparse. Among the hills in a remote area the Cursewood rises abruptly from the wilted and flat grassland of a barren valley.''
''The exact location is deliberately not fixed, but it is distant from the major settlements along the rivers and the Baltic Coast. In the neighboring valleys can be found tiny hamlets, farmsteads, huntingor logging camps, and all the inhabitants are terrified of the Cursewood. The main challenge in the location is surviving the hostile terrain and environment, which is unnatural and evil due to the Infernal taint of the place. The effect of the spirit’s intervention is to have nature itself resist any trespassers and any change, and after any clearance the elements of the place soon revert to their original and wild form, making the woods almost impenetrable. An expedition not guided by tough and skilled specialists and commanded by a strong-willed and resourceful leader is likely to not only fail in penetrating the woods but risks a horrible death.''

==Variant: Theban Tribunal==

''The Cursewood can easily be placed in the south-eastern part of the Order’s domain. For use in the Tribunal of Thebes it can be placed almost anywhere in Anatolia a fair distance inland and from major settlements. This can conceivably be in the Empire of Nicea. The genius loci is called Diekdikitís. For more local flavor switch the willow trees to hazel and the pines to cypress with no changes in stats.''

==Variant: Hibernian Tribunal==

''The Cursewood could also be set in the Hibernian Tribunal with only superficial changes. A suitably remote place would be in the Ulster region halfway between Lough Neagh and the northern coastline. Dúshlán will be the name of the genius loci; the rest of the Cursewood can be used with no other changes.''

==Variant: Normandy Tribunal==

''Finally, the Cursewood could be placed in the Normandy Tribunal with little change. An example of a remote place is midway between Vannes and St. Brieve. The genius loci should instead be called Aergad. No further changes are necessary.''
''The Cursewood''
''The Cursewood covers a roughly circular area about 30 miles across, with Regulus’ sanctum in the regio at the center. Set at intervals at the forest edge are stones bearing the mark of Regulus and his home covenant, signifying that this was a registered vis source. The forest and terrain are unnaturally mixed, and often foreign to the local region. It consists of menacing and wilting pines, oaks, and willows, all hung with moss, lichen, and cobwebs. Most of the area is relatively flat ground. The occasional steep, rocky hill rises from the ground, the largest almost a mile across. Several small springs feed the lake at the center with streams running off, crisscrossing the forest. In many of the lower-lying areas these streams have created swamps. Low-hanging, dark clouds hang over the woods causing thunder and periodic icecold showers. Using a spell like Intuition of the Forest does not work because communication with the forest is really with Wyzwanie, and he is too tormented to be coherent or helpful, nor will he speak with intruders before they have proved themselves worthy. The failure of this spell does hint at the presence of a forest spirit.''

[|

==The Nature of the Curse==

''Contrary to rumors, the hostile nature of the Cursewood is not caused by a curse at all, but by Wyzwanie. He is the spiritual embodiment of primal, hostile woodlands, which, in turn, he exists to protect. Anyone daring to enter is thoroughly tested to see whether he meets the high standards set. Wyzwanie repeatedly tests intruders by causing the terrain and environment to lash out, and tries to sabotage any attempts to ease the passage. The point is to drive away or kill those too weak to be worthy of his respect. A favored method is to strike first at the pack animals and supplies, then the servants, and guards of the leader. Anyone succeeding in his challenges is welcomed''
''into his inner domain to meet him. About a century ago an artifact of the powerful demon of rage and war, Terentia, was lost in Wyzwanie’s domain, and he decided to prevent it from being abused. Wyzwanie increased the demands on challengers. The tests serve to gauge whether the intruder is there to take the dark artifact or, alternatively, has sufficient strength and the correct mindset to destroy it. Since the rise of the infernal influence Wyzwanie has suffered torment and is extremely hard to appease, making the demands harder to meet. Until this problem is resolved Wyzwanie will not strike a deal.''

==The Affiliation of Regulus==

''The affiliation of Regulus is important to characters aiming to research him and the Cursewood. If the player magi live in an old covenant, Regulus was once a member here. It doesn’t matter whether they are young or experienced. If they live in a covenant formed within the last century, Regulus was once a member of the covenant where either an older member or one of the player magi’s parentes originate. Information has been passed down from master to apprentice through the years, but not widely circulated. As an alternative, old covenant records or correspondence about the situation can be found in the library. See the section on Research later.''

|]
''Trekking in the Cursewood''
''Penetrating the Cursewood is difficult and dangerous, and the main theme of the location is this challenge. It tests the leadership, cooperation, determination, and strength of will of those involved. Wyzwanie’s challenges are henceforth referred to as hazards. Each of the five stages represents a leg of the journey and causes the loss of one Long Term Fatigue Level. The storyguide describes the terrain and situation — along with any choices — and lets the players plan and choose to take countermeasures, using the mechanics described later. The troupe needs to choose a leader and a guide, although these roles can be changed in each stage. The leader is the person in charge of making final decisions, most likely a magus, but it could be a grog captain if the magi defer to him when in danger. Ideally it would be the character with the best Leadership Ability. The guide is the point man who uses his skills to make good progress and avoid dangers. This might be''
''the character with the best Ability score for the relevant terrain, but his Leadership Ability is also important. The leader and guide can manage a group of people no larger than their combined Leadership scores; exceeding this causes additional hazards as shown later. The main focus is on creating the feeling of doom and gloom of the threatening place, and so detailed rules can be foregone by a storyguide wishing to run the challenge in a looser way. Each stage of trekking requires a roll to check for progress and to avoid dangers, using the stats of the guide. The specific Characteristics and Abilities to be used depend on the terrain chosen, as does the nature of any hazards. The first stage is forest floor, and the characters are offered two or more choices''
''for the subsequent stages. Even though there are only three main types (forest, hills, and swamp), there are also short sections of paths or navigable stretches of swampy river, and each new choice should sound different. For example, after a stage in the forest, the characters reach swampy ground with pools of stinky, bubbling black mud. They can choose to wade straight on through this (swamp) or follow the edge of the wetlands through an area where the pines are white and without bark or branches, all covered by spiderwebs (forest again). Each stage takes a number of hours to complete equal to the number of hazards suffered, although always at least one.''
''Terrain Roll Forest Trail Stamina + Survival Forest Floor Perception + Survival Swamp Wading Stamina + Athletics Swamp/River Boat	 Dexterity + Profession:''
''Boating Swamp Swimming	 Strength + Swimming Hill Path Dexterity + Athletics Hill Climb Strength + Athletics''
''The following modifiers to the roll apply:''
''–1 per group member beyond the leader and guide +1 per group member who knows the Ability used apart from the guide –Encumbrance of the heaviest laden character –Wound and Fatigue penalties for the guide''
''Trek Progress''
''Add one extra hazard for each person exceeding the maximum group size, defined as the combined Leadership scores of the leader and guide.''
''Roll  Result 0 or Botch Lost in the woods,   no progress.    Suffer four hazards 3   Suffer four hazards 6   Suffer three hazards 9   Suffer two hazards''

[|

==Forest Lore==

''An individual with Forest Lore (see Guardians of the Forest, page 37) can try to commune with the forest spirit, but as this is a foreign place the character must have an Ability level of at least 3 to have any effect.''
''Score  Effect (foreign forest) 3 Character learns Wyzwanie’s name immediately, and after a few hours also learns of Regulus’ sanctum in the center as well as the Significatos (see later). 4 Character may commune with Wyzwanie, but only at the center of the woods, and learns of the infernal artifact. Wyzwanie will not offer deals until the artifact is destroyed. 5 Character knows after a little observation which effects are natural and which are caused by Wyzwanie. 6 Character may find vis, although it is vis sordida. 7 Character may travel the Cursewood unhindered by Wyzwanie if alone, but still needs to prove himself worthy if he wants to deal with the spirit. 8 Character is automatically judged as worthy. 9 Character may negotiate with Wyzwanie for Walking the Path (see later) without the need to solve the infernal problem first, although the Quests all concern this.''

==What is Known about Pomerania==

''At the first mention of the Cursewood, players may make a roll of Intelligence + Area Lore: Pomerania.''
''Known by All''
''Pomerania is sparsely settled with many wild areas ruled by supernatural entities.''
''Widely Known''
''Nobody ever goes there, and no routes take anybody even close. The woods are cursed, haunted, hostile, and not worth the effort.''
''Uncommon Knowledge''
''The woods are believed to infested with airy spirits of natural elements.''
''Lost Secrets''
''The effects sound like ones caused by a single powerful spirit.''

|]
''12  Suffer one hazard 18 or higher The first time this is   rolled, suffer only one   hazard, and for the next   stage the rolls are at +3.   If rolled subsequently,   no Hazards are suffered   during that stage, but   there is no bonus for the   following stage.''
''Retreat and Defeat''
''If the group decides to retreat, they suffer minimal harassment on the way out, which takes only an hour per stage. Wyzwanie might even be obliging and alter the terrain to be less difficult, for example, by turning a swamp into a small river flowing out. Eerie and unpleasant things still happen, but they are not dangerous and require no rolls. The terrain alters again behind the characters, so''
''the next visit, or even turning around again, is no easier. It is as if the forest expels the group in disgust; the characters hear a quiet, scornful laughter coming from nowhere in particular when they aren’t actively listening for it.''
''Rest, Sleep, and Supplies''
''The characters lose Fatigue, especially with magi using spontaneous magic, and need to rest. Remember to keep track of Long Term Fatigue Levels, each of which takes a full night’s rest to recover, and remember that Short Term Fatigue Levels are treated as the more serious levels, thus taking longer to recover from. For example, a magus with two Long Term and one Short Term Fatigue Levels recovers his Short Term as if it was his third level lost. Due to the evil nature of the woods and the hostile environment, recovery times are doubled for Short Term Fatigue. While the characters rest,''
''Wyzwanie sends some of the few animals still left in the wood to pester and disrupt the intruders. Examples are noisy ravens, swarms of mosquitoes, or squirrels pelting the sleeping characters with rotten acorns. If Wyzwanie decides to cause a hazard during the night, no Fatigue is recovered. Either way this also serves as a distraction during which Wyzwanie ruins the supplies or camping gear of an unlucky victim: blankets are torn by thorns, waterskins fill with mud, food is infested with maggots or flies. Due to the heavy corruption, ingesting any plants or water from the Cursewood immediately causes a Light Wound.''
''Hazards''
''A hazard means that one or more individuals in the group have had a mishap, with details dependent on the terrain, as described later. Only one or two individuals are in immediate danger at first, but the''
''danger soon spreads to the other player characters. By fast and clever use of magic or abilities they can try to avert the hazard or limit the damage. When choosing the initial victim, Wyzwanie likes to spread the suffering around to cause overall weakening. However, the current guide is an obvious choice. The spirit’s initial goal isn’t to kill or maim anyone, but to wear everyone down and make it clear that the place is dangerous. Weak or unskilled groups are driven off, or risk death or permanent injury if they insist on going on. A hazard caused indirectly by Wyzwanie’s powers, like moving or reshaping terrain features, does not need to penetrate. More direct attacks, as well as unnatural changes in elements, do need to Penetrate. Use Wyzwanie’s Penetration, remembering that he resides in a level 7 Magic regio, and so gets a +7 bonus to Penetration, while the characters are in a level 5 Infernal aura, and so face a –5 penalty to their Magic Resistance.''
''Forest''
''The forest is old with a mix of pines, willows, and oaks. Use the following examples to help you describe it.''
''Visual examples Sickly and twisted trees, covered in hanging moss and cobwebs, pale and unhealthy or bright and venomously-looking in color. The terrain is flat and covered in thick moss or rotting plants which hide jagged rocks or hidden crevices below, hostile growths like thorn scrub and stinging nettles, pools of stinking slime, or broken ground and loose rubble.''
''Auditory examples Eerie and distant sounds like creaking branches in the undergrowth, groaning trees, howls, cries, or hisses from unseen creatures, sounds of running feet starting and stopping suddenly, and rumbling in the very earth.''
''Olfactory examples Heavy smell of decomposing plants, sweet stink of rotting flesh, hot and dry smell of volcanic rock, or a delicate perfumed scent completely out of place.''

===Events for Inspiration:===

''• Attack from a Corrupted Tree. In the forest, this is an oak. • Surrounded by thorns. The group is encircled by a thick patch of naturally occurring thorn bushes. This effect is the same as Wall of Thorns (ArM5, page 135). Requires Penetration. • Pitfall. A character falls into either a new fissure which opens up or an existing one hidden by branches and dead leaves. A fall of 10 feet results in a +2 damage for mud, +5 for dirt, or +10 for rocks.''
''Hills''
''Hills of varying sizes dot the forest with jagged rocks penetrating the topsoil, sparsely covered in pine trees. Dark and fetid springs well up through cracks, forming small streams running down toward the lake in the center of the woods.''
''Visual examples Earth mound with thick undergrowth of thorn scrub, steep rocky slope with slimy moss, jagged rocks and loose debris, or treacherous clefts hidden by plants.''
''Auditory examples Winds above the treetops resemble a scream, springs bubble noisily or explode in geysers, unseen rocks tumbling loose, or the scrape of metal or claws on bare rock.''
''Olfactory examples Sharp metallic scent of rocks, sulfurous springs, or smell of sap from the pines.''

===Events for Inspiration:===

''• Slope becomes steeper and surface transforms into loose, jagged rocks. Dexterity rolls are needed to avoid falling. The Ease Factor is 6 to stay in place or 15 to move up the slope. A fall means +5 damage from sliding in sharp rocks. Once a character is sliding, he takes +3 damage and roll Dexterity–3 each round until he stops. The storyguide may require between three and five successful rolls to get safely off the loose rocks. Requires Penetration for sharp rocks, but not for becoming steep. • Attack from a Corrupted Tree. In the hills, this is a pine. • Hostile weather. This may be anything from effects like Talons of the Wind (ArM5, page 127) or Charge of the Angry Winds (ArM5, page 125), to simply rain or snow that hampers the group’s actions further. Requires Penetration for damage, but not for causing uncomfortable weather. • Exploding ground. An effect like The Earth’s Carbuncle (ArM5, page 156). Requires Penetration.''
''Swamplands''
''The run-off from the once crystal clear lake at the center crisscross the forest floor with small streams that occasionally flood flat ground.''
''Visual examples Bubbling black mud, trickling water covering sickly yellow quicksand, banks of foul mist drifting lazily around and closing in on intruders when they are not looking, treacherously idyllic pools with lily pads, or fallen slippery logs almost forming a path of bridges, but some of them won’t support a person.''
''Auditory examples Complete silence occasionally interrupted by a single splash, squelching of mud,''
''buzzing of mosquitoes, or the croak of what sounds like enormous frogs.''

===Events for Inspiration:===

''• Sucking quicksand. Earthen hands grab the victim in an effect similar to Hands of the Grasping Earth (ArM5, page 156). The hands drag victims below the water and mud over three rounds. Anyone not freed by then suffers Deprivation of air (ArM5, page 180). There may be more hands ready to attack anyone trying to help the initial victim. Requires Penetration. • Attack from a Corrupted Tree. In the swamp, this is a willow. • Churning waters. A sudden current whirls victims around and carries them toward the edge of the woods in a suddenly formed river. Victims roll Strength + Swimming (or Profession: Boating) against an Ease Factor of 12 to reach the safety of the river banks. Failure means that the victim is pulled along adding another hazard during this stage to account for the increased time spent. A single botch carries the victim far, losing all progress during this stage, while a triple botch sends them out of the Cursewood to start all over again.''

==The Center of the Woods==

''The center of the woods holds the key to solving the mystery and getting the rewards.''
''Regulus’ Encampment''
''Regulus’ encampment and his sanctum are located in the middle of the woods. In a clearing surrounded by a low wall of stacked stone there remain only the ruined foundations of a cottage close to the lake shore, where rotting boats are tied to the bank. These are the echoes of what remains of his sanctum and the immediate area, which was pulled into a Magic regio (see later) formed''
''as the Infernal aura impinged. At the storyguide’s discretion a moldy, tattered copy of Regulus’ journals can be found here, if the characters deserve or need clues for further investigation. The daimon gives intruders no rest and keeps on challenging them, so even magi who have found shortcuts suffer the torments of this place. At some point they either retreat, perish, or are found worthy. This area used to have a Magic aura of 4, but this is currently suppressed by the Infernal aura of the Cursewood. Entry to the regio is gained by crossing the low wall, where Wyzwanie discreetly manifests himself through some natural medium and leads worthy visitors inside. Unworthy intruders cannot gain entry without his help, not even forcibly through the use of magic. Second Sight reveals the existence of a regio, but not any way to enter. A significant criteria for being deemed worthy is having braved and survived the trek through the cursed forest while fighting off the challenges.''
''The Old Oak''
''Just inside the wall stands a menacing old tree. It is an ancient, twisted oak with ash gray bark and leaves the color of blood. Lines and contours in the bark make the trunk look like a face in pain. From one of the branches hangs a length of rotting rope. This is where Regulus was hanged, and his bones can be found scattered below the tree inside the regio.''

==The Infernal Aura of the Cursewood==

''Emanating from the old oak near the encampment where Regulus was hanged, an Infernal aura with a rating of 5 covers the area to the edge of the Cursewood. The aura is a Malevolent aura, a specific kind of corrupted aura brought about by cruelty, the heinous sins of the diabolists, and the murder of Regulus and their foul rituals following this event. This phenomenon is explained in detail in Realms of Power: The Infernal, pages 12–14, but, the most important effects are listed here:''
''• Wounds suffer a penalty to Recovery rolls equal to the aura rating of 5 while inside. This is a basic effect of any Infernal aura and is not specific to Malevolent auras. • The aura strength of 5 is added to any Damage total. • All physical activities suffer 5 additional botch dice from the aura; this includes all rolls for trek progress. Botches are more likely to result in injury, with Wound level equal to number of botches. • Any old wounds caused specifically by demons reopen, no matter how long ago they occurred. An Incapacitating or Heavy wound reopens as a Wound two steps lower than the original.''

==The Regio==

''Regulus’ encampment is now hidden in a Magic regio of level 7. If Wyzwanie allows it, the regio may be entered by simply crossing the wall. Any not deemed worthy remain at''

[|

==Using Shortcuts and Magic==

''Bear in mind that magi may very well succeed in using shortcuts to the center of the woods. Flying over the treetops, tunneling below the forest floor, or getting an Arcane Connection to the center to teleport to are among the obvious ideas. However the regio can only be entered by those led by Wyzwanie, and he only allows this once he is satisfied. Persistent magi who find clever shortcuts may very well earn his respect that way, in the end. On the other hand the use of magic to deal with the hazards is by no means discouraged, and clever use of low magnitude magic or shows of force impress Wyzwanie. A magus showing strength this way is tested again with a completely different hazard before earning full respect. Obviously magi specializing in elemental and natural magic fare better than Mentem or Vim specialists here. A Herbam magus with a Magical Focus in wood can defuse or bypass most obstacles with ease, but still risks fatigue loss and multiple botches due to the hostile aura.''

|]
''the mundane level. The encampment appears as it was before it retreated into the regio. At the side of the central lake is an area cleared of trees, where a stream from the hills feeds the lake. At the bank, a rowboat is tied to a stake. A moderately sized cottage has been built from stacked boulders, and is marked with Regulus’ sanctum marker. Inside there is space for a lab, but one has not yet been set up; the cottage only holds his books on magical subjects, and his journals. The oak clearly has unnatural features resembling a face in agony. Below the oak are the bones of Regulus, partly covered by dirt and growing weeds. His spirit has long since ventured into the Magic Realm through his continued challenge of the powers surrounding him. Here also lie scattered his enchanted devices; see the section on magical treasures later. Wyzwanie shows himself in the form of a huge boulder covered in vines, and starts to tell his story. For details about Wyzwanie, see Inhabitants later.''

==Vis Sites==

''Below are given a number of vis sources from which the storyguide can choose; not all of them need be present or accessible at once. Only use the ones which best fit your saga and its vis balance. Some could also be held back for introduction later on.''
''The Poisoned Sap''
''The old oak oozes thick, green, and poisonous sap from cracks in the bark, forming around the facial features depicted on the trunk. Once per year, a magus may spend an entire season in a process similar to vis extraction to collect pawns of Perdo vis sordida equal to (Aura + Intelligence + Infernal Lore + stress die)/5 rounding up. A double botch or higher requires a check for Twilight.''
''Apples of Indigo Hue''
''A small part of the forest close to the clearing looks as if it were once cultivated''
''as an orchard. A single apple tree bears blue apples; up to 4 pawns of Herbam vis sordida can be harvested each year.''
''Crystal Geodes''
''Inside a cave below the highest hill, translucent crystals grow out of fissures in the bedrock. Once a crystal is fully grown, it turns opaque and falls off the wall. Up to 4 pawns of Terram vis sordida can be harvested each year.''
''The Silver Fish''
''At the edge of the lake, the largest stream from the hills ends in a small pool with fish. Up to 4 pawns of Aquam vis sordida can be harvested each year.''
''The Lightning Tree''
''On top of a hill where lightning strikes often stands a clump of trees, all with significant lightning damage. Charred branches glowing with a white light contain vis; up to 4 pawns of Auram vis sordida can be harvested each year.''
''De-Corrupting the Vis''
''Tainted vis stays corrupted, but once the Magic aura is dominant any future vis is clean, normal, magical vis. After a full year with no Infernal influence, all vis sources are free from corruption.''

==Changing the Aura==

''To remove the Infernal aura, the characters must first remove the source of the infernal taint so it no longer feeds the aura, and then develop another, stronger aura. If the oak is destroyed, and the remains of Regulus are properly buried, the Infernal aura sits dormant and neglected, making it possible to diminish it. If the Magic aura equals the Infernal, it takes precedence because it was the original one. Only if the Infernal aura drops below the Magic will it start to deteriorate, so further work must be done to remove it completely. More detail can be found in Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 10–11, but in essence, once the Infernal focus is removed and the Infernal aura is lower than the other aura, the Infernal aura drops by 1 after a number of years equal to its strength.''
''Thus, three years after the Infernal aura is reduced to 3, it falls to 2, and will disappear completely in a further three years if not maintained. The magic aura could also theoretically be increased; the rules can be found in Realms of Power: Magic, pages 10–11. However, this is quite difficult. A stress roll made once per year against an Ease Factor of 15 is needed for a permanent increase of 1. Magical activities like lab work, spellcasting, vis study, or Twilight episodes with beneficial outcomes may yield a bonus of usually between +1 to +3. The storyguide may also reward creative magi for actions such as appropriately burying Regulus in a place where his journals indicate he achieved great things, or dominating magical spirits to bind them near the sanctum.''

==Story Seed: Hell in the Backyard==

''Does a diminishing Infernal aura simply fade out? Perhaps a tricky demon draws the remaining Infernal aura into a regio where he hides and grows in power. For example, Kraxios Lord of Wrath sees an opportunity here to ply his wicked trade. He has the power to cause people to dream witnessing their friends and neighbors perform acts of bestial atrocity, and to posses these false witnesses in order to egg them on to urge others to punish the imagined culprits. Kraxios affects several grogs who all become paranoid, spy on each other, spread rumors and in time perform sinful acts — or so he hopes. Eventually one or more grogs affected by this start causing trouble at the covenant. While the magi can contain this, it takes hard work to unravel the plot, which in the end leads to the unknown regio in the Cursewood.''

|]

==Inhabitants==

''Apart from the genius loci itself, inhabitants of the Cursewood are limited to corrupted trees. Living for a time in the Infernal aura have caused these to become disfigured and truly evil. The effects of the curse have awakened some of the trees to a certain degree, and the Infernal taint has corrupted them.''

==Magical Treasures==

''Inside the cottage housing his sanctum, hidden inside the magical regio, are found the magical resources of Regulus. His artifacts lie among his scattered bones at the Old Oak, and all his vis stores were expended during his last stand. However, a stout cabinet with carved doors holds his books safely.''

''Scattered carelessly among the debris and shrubs covering the remains of Regulus lie his enchanted devices. As the area of his demise retreated into a Magic regio the artifacts never fell into the hands of the infernalists and were preserved from natural decay.''

==Vis Sordida==

''In the Infernal aura vis sordida (“filthy vis,” see Realms of Power: The Infernal, pages 18–19) forms spontaneously in various places. For anyone not using powers derived from the Infernal, using this vis carries with it some risks and complications, as well as a few beneficial effects:''
''• Each season spent in close proximity to the vis (for example, using it in the lab) incurs a temporary Personality Trait of Wrathful +1. If the magus already has this trait (or one closely resembling it) increase this by 1 instead. If the magus indulges in a sinful act of Wrath the trait becomes permanent, but he gains a Confidence Point.''
''• Modify casting total by +5 per pawn. • Add three extra botch dice per pawn used; if the magus has ways of reducing the number of botch dice, he still rolls a minimum of one per pawn used. • Botches are more severe and often cause damage or put the caster in direct peril. • +1 bonus to Source Quality per pawn for studying Hermetic Arts. • If used to prepare an item for enchantment, ten levels of effects per pawn used are corrupted. Effects invested into the item must use the Experimentation rules until the corrupted levels are used up.''

==Wyzwanie, The Spirit of the Cursed Wood==

''Magic Might: 40 (Herbam), Might Pool 85 (due to Hibernation power) Characteristics: Int +3, Per +3, Pre 0, Com +3, Str 0, Sta +1, Dex 0, Qik 0 Confidence Score: 1 (3) Size: n/a Season: Autumn Virtues and Flaws: Magic Spirit, Daimon; Ways of the Forest; Improved Characteristics x4; Driven, Proud Magical Qualities and Inferiorities: Focus Power (x8), Greater Power, Ritual Power (x6); Reduced Abilities (x4) Personality Traits: Driven +3, Pained +3, Proud +2 Reputation: None Abilities: Area Lore: Cursewood 6 (geography), Awareness 6 (intruders), Infernal Lore 4 (demons), Latin 5 (Hermetic), Local Language 5 (oratory), Magic Lore 6 (spirits), Magic Theory 1 (Vim), Teaching 5 (Magic Lore) Powers: Hibernation, 15 points, Init –20, Vim: The spirit remains completely inactive for a year, and the 15 points spent on this power are added to its Might Pool for the first year out of hibernation. Its Might Pool may exceed its permanent Might score and may be saved up from year to year, but is limited to a maximum of 3 times Might. Thanks to the dark legends about the wood, Wyzwanie has lain dormant for many years before the events of this chapter occur. (Ritual Power x3). Grant Deficiency, 5 points, Init –10, Mentem: Until the next sunrise or sunset, the target of this power forgets some skill he possesses, effectively halving it. This can be an Ability or a Hermetic Form.

Presence, 0 points, constant, Imaginem: The spirit can sense all places of its domain at the same time.(Greater Power). Ruler of Nature, variable cost, Init 0− Might cost. Aquam, Auram, Herbam, or''
''Terram: Duplicates any non-ritual spell pertaining to weather, natural waterways (no unnatural liquids), trees and plants (not processed plant products), or earth and stone (not metals or worked stone) of no more than 9th magnitude. Cost is equal to magnitude. (4 Focus Powers x2). Vis: If killed, 8 pawns of Herbam vis in the form of moss; this is vis sordida if the Infernal aura is still present. Appearance: Wyzwanie is the consciousness of the entire Cursewood, but the daimon has created an aspect of itself taking the shape of a huge, overgrown boulder of about 30 cubic paces. Inside this is where the Infernal artifact is kept. Killing the aspect or forcing Wyzwanie to retreat to the Magic Realm effectively releases the demonic artifact from his protection. This is likely to be bad.''
''Dealing with Wyzwanie''
''If the challenges are met, and the player magi gain entrance to the central regio of the Cursewood, Wyzwanie tells his story. He is the spiritual embodiment of a dark and hostile forest and hence does not have any other motivations. The strong demonic influence torments him, and he periodically succumbs to his pain and anguish by creating powerful effects, but for now he will not hurt the characters as long as they are inside the regio. All those getting this far is respected for their determination and strength, and he dares to ask them to remove and dispose of the Infernal artifact. He does not know how to destroy the artifact, only that it needs to be cleansed of its evil. Player magi who research the demon Terentia and demonic artifacts in general may roll Intelligence + Infernal or Dominion Lore versus an Ease Factor of 12 for a season of study with an appropriate selection of books. Success leads to a solution, described later.''
''Wyzwanie negotiates no further as long as the artifact remains, and until an''
''agreement is reached even those who have spoken with him suffer the challenges again if they return to the Cursewood. Should the Infernal taint and artifact be removed, Wyzwanie is finally at peace. He still follows his nature as a hostile forest and as such the “curse” remains. However, clever player magi can negotiate for free passage for themselves, thus opening up a secluded and protected location with many valuable resources. As the friendship with Wyzwanie evolves, provided the magi visiting him or even residing in his woods are respectful of the dangerous forest, the daimon can be the source of many boons to the magi. Depending on which resources are available and desirable to the troupe, he may tell them how to learn Nature Lore (see Guardians of the Forests).''
''Cult of Wyzwanie''
''Player magi who manage to free Wyzwanie from the torment of the infernal device can communicate with him. While he has no interest in any worshipers or reverence he wishes his forest to be kept safe and rewards both loyalty and those he finds worthy. Regulus was working on a sort of Mystery Cult using the mechanics for Walking the Path from Guardians of the Forests (pages 35–40), by communing with Wyzwanie. The character makes a Sacrifice (by accepting a Flaw), finishes a Quest (by serving the spirit in some way), in order to gain the Fruit (a Virtue). The strong presence of natural elements suggests Affinities or Puissance with Auram, Aquam, Herbam or Terram as being appropriate, as well as Major or Minor Foci with these elements or with spirits. Also appropriate are Ways of the Forest or a variant of Elemental Magic (ArM5, page 41) affecting Herbam rather than Ignem, called Nature Wizard. Quests all pertain to cleansing the forest of Infernal corruption, keeping it safe, or seeking out and destroying Terentia’s followers.''

|]
''magic spirits inhabiting the object, equivalent to 2–4 pawns of vis for study. At least one Significato can be found for each of Auram, Aquam, Herbam and Terram; clues to these are found in the journal of Regulus. Any individual Significato may only be studied once per year, and Wyzwanie allows the use of only one each season. As long as the Infernal aura is dominant, the Significatos count as vis sordida, as explained earlier. Unless an agreement is reached with Wyzwanie, the Significatos can’t be used, since the curse actively repels intruders and makes study impossible.''

==Variant: Dark Faerie Aura==

''The one change here is that the heinous acts performed by Terentia’s diabolical minions merely resulted in a modest Infernal aura. This quickly disappeared again after the diabolists left and no longer indulged in sinful rituals. At this point, a dark faerie prince called Schwarzholz saw his opportunity. He was originally a powerful force in the neighboring valley who tormented the locals and gained vitality from the countermeasures they took against him. As Wyzwanie grew in strength and increased the effects of his curse to protect the Infernal device, the few locals who had ventured here simply stopped coming. As the diabolists left, Schwarzholz moved in''
''and played the part of demonic taint. He can send out ravens to confuse travelers and the closest residents and lead them astray to terrorize once they set foot in his domain. The Cursewood is, in fact, under the control of a moderately powerful Faerie aura, but faerie powers and illusions result in the same effects as the Malevolent Infernal aura in the form of added botch dice, added damage, and penalties to Abilities and magic. These effects need to penetrate and use the Might of Schwarzholz. A storyguide using this option may need Realms of Power: Faerie in order to better manage the mechanics of faeries and in order to design Schwarzholz’s powers. Schwarzholz is equal in power to Wyzwanie. He manages to fool the genius loci into thinking there is still an Infernal taint, to maintain his continued torment.''

==Variant: Wyzwanie as a Faerie==

''Wyzwanie could instead be a powerful faerie. The rest of the story, including the Infernal taint, is kept unchanged. This would result in his domain in the woods being a powerful Faerie regio rather than a Magic one, and cleansing the area of the infernal corruption results in a dark faerie forest. The vis sources found here are faerie-aspected as well; however, the Significatos are universal and usable''
''by magi with no changes. Wyzwanie as a faerie is not evil but certainly malicious, and his challenges make sense, since the precautions and suffering of intruders are what feed him vitality. The very nature of faeries means that Wyzwanie cannot be dealt with in the same way as if he were a daimon, since faeries want and need interaction with humans. Wyzwanie has faerie powers close to what the daimon-version has, but the storyguide may find Realms of Power: Faeries very useful with regard to the concept of vitality, among other things. The prospect of owning a faerie forest with faerie resources is likely less appealing to most Houses, but would be a great boon to Merinita magi. Regulus was interested in winning challenges and gaining power, so any powerful creature would do.''

==Researching the Cursewood==

''Although no living person has been to the place, it is not beyond dedicated researchers to find some information. Once Regulus’ name is known, what little is recorded about him can be found. His home covenant — be it the player magi’s or one of their parentes’ — holds records and information. Covenant rolls can be studied, correspondence can be read, and magi descended from his contemporaries can be interviewed.''
''Regulus’ Home Covenant''
''Regulus’ sodales in his home covenant know that he found something very challenging and potentially valuable. Returning gravely wounded after a scouting mission he started dedicated preparations. There is mention of him saying that he had placed stones with his mark in several places to signify areas of his interest, in order to discourage others from interfering. He spent years studying Arts and arcane lore, researching spells, and building devices before setting off again. The story gets somewhat thin here, as official records reveal no more. But the occasional mention in a magus’ personal''
''journal or a note sent to a trusted amica reveals that he apparently succeeded, at least in the first stage, and spent some years in this new place. He officially moved his sanctum from the covenant to parts unknown. Rumor had it that he was looking for followers to form a new covenant. And after this, he was never again heard from.''
''Official Records''
''Official House Mercere records list him as giving his home covenant as the place to leave messages for him, under the condition that he was personally responsible for col''
''lecting them. House Guernicus notes him officially entering the Order upon completing his Gauntlet and swearing the Code. Considering the fact that he was Tytalus, there are few remarks about him in legal documents. Apparently, he reported having fought some diabolists and something about the demon Terentia, but there was no suspicion of him handling the situation in any improper way. Casual remarks label him as having Vim as a special interest. Records among his fellow Tytali wisely enough contained no information about his activities or whereabouts, but they confirm his identity, history, and interest in Vim and spirits.''

==Corrupted Trees==

''A corrupted tree does not fight using the usual rules. The tree waits for an opportune moment when a lone individual is distracted, just below its branches, or even resting up against the trunk. It then makes a surprise attack to grapple or immobilize the victim and proceed to digest his body. Content with one victim, most trees try to fend off other people by striking them with its branches. The multiple branches do not attack as a group, and only one branch attacks each victim at a time. Due to the sheer size and toughness of the tree, only heavy, sharp-edged weapons stand a chance of hurting it. Living wood counts as “barely flammable,” requiring Ignem spells of base 10, or fire damage of +15. The storyguide needs to use common sense regarding other spell attacks. Crystal Dart works, but Piercing Shaft of Wood can’t hurt it. Most of its attacks cause Deprivation from lack of air, for which rules can be found in ArM5, page 180.''
''Corrupted Oak, Willow, or Pine Infernal Might: 10 (Herbam) Characteristics: Int 0, Per 0, Pre –6, Com –3, Str +5, Stm +5, Dex –2, Qik –3 Size: +5 Ferocity Score: 1 (3) Virtues and Flaws: Ferocity, Corrupted Tree Personality Traits: Bloodthirsty +6, Patient +3 (+6 for Pine) Combat, Oak: Grapple with branch: Init n/a*, Attack +16*, Defense +7, Damage +10 Strike with branch (4 in total): Init +5, Attack +10, Defense +7, Damage +10 * As an ambush the oak always''
''strikes first and has a large bonus to the attack roll due to surprise. If a grappled victim is not freed within three rounds, the victim ends up in a cavity in the tree which closes and slowly suffocates him. Causing a Heavy Wound or higher hacks the trunk open and frees the victim. Combat, Willow: Grapple with branch: Init n/a*, Attack +19*, Defense +7, Damage n/a (only strangling) Strike with branch (12 in total): Init +9, Attack +13, Defense +9, Damage +7 * As an ambush the willow always strikes first and has a large bonus to the attack roll due to surprise. The grapple is with one or more thin, whip-like branches in a stranglehold across the throat. The tree lifts the victim off the ground, choking him. Barbs sprout from the branches dealing +5 damage per round Soaked only by Stamina and modified by Wound Penalties. The rest of the branches are used to keep other potential victims at bay while it drinks the blood. Combat, Pine: Spray of Sap:Init n/a*, Attack +19*, Defense +5, Damage n/a (only choking and immobilization) Strike with branch (6 in total): Init +9, Attack +13, Defense +9, Damage +7 * As an ambush the pine hits automatically. When a potential victim moves below its branches the tree sprays him from behind with sap to pin him to the ground and choke him and drops a thick layer of pine needles to hide the victim. The victim can’t breathe and is immobilized when the sap hardens. To move in any way during a''
''round, the victim needs to make a Strength – Encumbrance roll. The Ease Factor is 6 in the first round, and 9 in the second, but increases to 12 on the third and later rounds. Following the initial attack the Corrupted Pine stands motionless and relies on not being identified as the source of the attack. As it looks like all the other pines growing around it a stress roll of Perception + Awareness against an Ease Factor of 15 is required to identify it. If attacked it defends itself with its branches. The Corrupted Pine feeds on the decomposing body with its large network of roots. Powers: Animated Branches, 0 points, Herbam. The tree can move its branches around, using them as weapons. Soak: +12 Oak and Pine, +8 for Willow. The only useful mundane weapons are heavy, sharp weapons such as axes. Fatigue: Tireless Wound Penalties: 0 (1–10), –1 (11–20), –3 (21–30), Incapacitated (31–40), Dead (41+). Dealing a Heavy Wound renders one branch non-functional (a Medium Wound is sufficient to destroy a branch on a Willow). Once all branches are destroyed, or the tree is Incapacitated, it is unable to attack or defend itself. It recovers fully over the course of a few weeks unless completely killed. Vis: Each tree destroyed leaves behind 2 pawns of Herbam vis sordida. Appearance: The corrupted tree is a twisted, wilted and eerie version of its type, but most other trees in the Cursewood also look like this.''

''Regulus’ Amica''
''As an extra clue, a descendant of a trusted amica of Regulus sends material to the player magi. Regulus had corresponded with Mara, a young ex Miscellanea maga whom he sought to recruit for his project of a new covenant and Mystery Cult. Regulus sent her a book written by him, as mentioned earlier. Intended to help her find her way, it also offered cryptic clues hinting of the existence of a powerful spirit residing in the Cursewood, that getting to the goal is a challenge of one’s will and determination, and that something of great importance is hidden and protected in the woods. She ventured there once, but her approach was thwarted by the curse. Mara herself produced a book, Curses and Corruption, a Tractatus on Area Lore: Cursewood, Quality 8, which was passed down through her lineage but neglected as uninteresting. Once Regulus stopped writing, she gave up on the idea and died a few years later. When Regulus entered the woods he gave Mara his sigil as his proxy, with permission to pass it down to her Hermetic descendants.''
''The Prying Monk''
''Among the correspondence left behind by Mara is a letter from Regulus mentioning that he scared off a curious monk from a nearby monastery. Anyone with even superficial knowledge of the area or the structure of the local diocese can narrow down this reference to a specific place. It takes some diplomacy and effort from suitably skilled and inoffensive researchers in order to gain access to records. A monk called Franz was traveling the countryside and deviated from his route to investigate rumors of a cursed place. Records say he was assaulted by the very trees and scared off by a ghost. He returned some years later (the dates show this to be shortly after the demise of Regulus) and reports the place being even more cursed than before. His observations are recognized by anyone possessing Infernal Lore to suggest the place is tainted by a Malevolent aura. They refer to the book De Operationes Daemonum Dialogos by''
''Michael Psellos (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 41), originally in Greek, which he hid behind the bookcases. This particular copy is a translation into Latin and is a Summa in Infernal Lore Level 5 Quality 10. Reading this book gives clues as to how the Infernal aura originated and spread and how it may be removed again.''

==Hooks for Using the Cursewood Again==

''The severity of the curse makes it likely that the first attempt by the magi will fail, and they return home to prepare better for the second attempt. Disposing of the infernal artifact is most likely not attempted the first time around, also requiring a subsequent return. Of course, the player magi might already have decided to form a new covenant, move an existing one, or establish a chapter house there.''

==Researchers Have Hit Paydirt==

''Survivors of the first expedition have returned home to recuperate and are curious about the Cursewood and Regulus. If any information about this is shared in Hermetic circles, new avenues of information may open up, fellow magi or academics coming forth with help. Researching the history or geography of the place leads to knowledge that makes a second expedition more likely to succeed. Books on Area Lore: Cursewood (see Researching the Cursewood, earlier) are highly useful. Reading these tells the magi to prepared for withstanding supernatural effects pertaining to weather, earth, water, and trees. Theories about the Infernal aura and how to suppress the effects are also valuable knowledge. After reviewing the new information, and armed with experience from the last foray, intrepid magi can prepare in a more dedicated manner. They have a better idea of what''

==Destroying the Infernal Artifact==

''One of the Infernal artifact’s powers is the ability to reform if destroyed or to move to another physical form, although this takes time. It can be hidden under the deepest seas, entombed below ground, or tossed into a volcano, but Terentia is forever drawn to it. These are only temporary solutions which open up further stories. For true and permanent disposal the artifact must be taken to a truly holy place, and only a completely pious person can destroy it. In game mechanical terms it needs to be taken to a cathedral or other place with a Dominion aura of at least 5. Here, an ordained clergyman possessing True Faith can, after hours of prayer and ceremony, destroy the artifact by expenditure of a Faith Point. The artifact need have no powers that can affect the characters; maybe only a demon can use it. It can, of course, be given powers if that suits the story the troupe wants to tell.''

|]
''arcane secrets and resources can be found and can even work on restoring the woods to a place of magic.''

==Chasing Rivals==

''Even though the magi were careful to not share any important facts with anyone else about the first expedition, known rivals or other opportunistic and supernaturally skilled individuals (Hermetic or exotic as best fits the saga) have found out something. The rivals are looking for the infernal artifact, ignorant of its exact nature. Not only are they mounting a sizable expedition to the Cursewood is, but one of the grogs from the previous expedition is missing. This should get the minds of the magi stirring. What do the rivals know? What do they want? Are they sufficiently skilled and well-prepared to conquer the Cursewood? Are they going to discover great magical secrets and in a sense steal these, leaving the player magi with nothing more than the scars from the first expedition? The player magi need to hurry if they want to beat their rivals to the goal. Alternatively, the storyguide can arrange for rumors of the rivals’ preparations to reach the player magi in advance in order to give them a season or two to prepare.''

==Bringing Criminals to Justice==

''Magnus the Quaesitor approaches the magi who are veterans of the trip to the Cursewood. Even if little information has been shared with the Order, he knows at least the location and the cursed nature of the place. He was recently working on a case of suspected diabolism practiced by a Hermetic maga and her infernalist cohorts. A Hoplite on their tracks last reported them as taking refuge in the Cursewood, from where they have failed to return. Magnus asks the magi to do their duty and help bring the criminals to justice. Since one can only guess what vile deeds they are up to in the infernal place, time is of the essence. If the player magi succeed in convincing Magnus that they need time to prepare, he insists they send scouts to keep an eye on things and make sure the criminals don’t get away. Even if the diabolists have all perished in the woods, he feels obliged to find their earthly remains, summon the ghosts and interrogate them to make sure the diabolical plot does not reach further. Some characters may be suspicious of a Quaesitor so bent on entering a cursed forest to summon Infernal ghosts, of course.''
