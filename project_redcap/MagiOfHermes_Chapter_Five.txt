''Concept: A magus who relishes physical combat, and who has developed many spells and enchanted items to make him a more formidable opponent.''
''Hugh Hostis of Flambeau was late to begin his apprenticeship; he was already fourteen years old when his master discovered him on the streets of the city, being used as a heavy by a local street gang, intimidating people with his Gift. The magus of House Flambeau took the boy in, and after taming him, taught him magic. Hugh was trained in the School of Ramius, a Flambeau style of combat that emphasizes mundane attacks and magical defenses, and he spent nearly as much time drilling in combat with the grogs as he did in the laboratory. He has become an excellent soldier, easily the match of many experienced grogs especially as a brawler, but has been struck around the head so many times that he has permanently damaged his hearing. Hugh has a natural talent for combining magic and combat. His mother told him that the blood of the valkyries — supernatural warrior women of the Northern lands — flowed in his veins, and that they provide him with armor whenever he needs it. Hugh never holds back in combat; he is always with the warriors in the front line, sometimes acting as leader and/or vanguard of the fighting force. Since his Mythic Blood rarely leaves him fatigued, he often casts defensive spells on his fellow soldiers to make them better warriors. The grogs respect his fighting ability but fear his recklessness and his temper. His favored tactic is to strike a supernatural target in battle with a weapon then follow up with a spell, using the blood on the blade as an Arcane Connection to enhance Penetration. After nearly a half-century of service, Hugh has become a prominent member of the tribunal, taking it upon himself to hunt down Marched magi with a group of loyal grogs and impose the punishment of the''
''Order. Two decades after his apprenticeship Hugh came to the attention of the Legion of Mithras (see The Mysteries, Revised Edition, pages 118–122), a Mystery cult devoted to the defense of the Order from outside threats. He was initiated and has achieved the second rank, called the Bride. He has made excursions beyond the bounds of the Order’s territories to investigate rumors of hostile magicians, and slain several hedge wizards as a consequence. He personally does not feel that any of the magicians he has faced posed a serious threat to the Order, but he is a loyal soldier and does what he is told.''

''Appearance: a roan charger whose pelt is the color of dried blood.''
''Bathild claims descent from Sleipnir, the fabled horse ridden by Odin. Hugh sought out an einheri (a ghostly warrior dedicated to Odin) and bargained with him. In exchange for the horse over which the einheri was guardian, Hugh was obliged to start a war between two villages. Since this occurred deep in the territory of the hypothesized Order of Odin, he does not consider that he broke the Code of Hermes in performing this duty. When Hugh forged the initial familiar bond with Bathild, his Rego Terram Lab Total (with the assistance of his apprentice) was 43, which was just sufficient for his purpose. He has the following Bond Scores: Gold +1, Silver +1, Bronze +3. (Bathild was created according to the rules in Realms of Power: The Magic Realm, Magical Characters)''

''New Spells''
''Hugh has developed the new spells that are listed here.''
''Corpus''

===Assume the Stature of the Giants of Eld===

''MuCo 10 R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind Adds +3 to the caster’s normal Size, turning him into a veritable giant. The caster’s clothing, armor, and weapons are also increased in size in proportion. Characteristics are not affected by the size change, but the caster’s wound ranges change accordingly: at Size +3, the caster’s wounds have eight-point increments (1–8 points for a Light Wound, 9–16 for a Medium Wound, and so forth). Casting requisites of Animal, Herbam, and Terram are usually required to affect all the target’s equipment. A size modifier is required for this spell since the final size is ten times the mass of a base target for Corpus. (Base 3, +1 Diam, +1 size, +1 to increase equipment as well)''

===Avalanche of Flesh and Steel===

''MuCo 10 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group Up to ten men of Size +1 become capable of running as fast as a horse. Hugh uses this specifically on a group of warriors, and maintains concentration only long enough for them to charge their foes. This gives them a bonus to their first Attack Total equal to their Athletics Ability, up to a maximum of +3. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group)''

===The Blessing of Starkad===

''MuCo 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part The target grows two more arms. These extra manipulators enhance certain Dexterity tasks such as climbing, and Strength rolls representing the extra muscle power available to the target, such as forcing open doors. In these situations the target receives a +3 bonus to his total. Additionally, the target can wield an additional set of weapons in combat. He can now manage either two single weapons and two shields, or a Great weapon and a shield. If fighting singly, the character makes two attacks per round, one with each set of weapons. If fighting as a group, consider the group to have an extra member, who does not count against the Leadership Ability of the group leader, if any. This extra member is excluded when determining the damage taken by the group. Casting requisites are necessary to adjust the targets in an appropriate manner, else clothing rips and armor hampers the use of the new limbs. Starkad Aludreng was a hero descended from the Norse giants; he possessed eight arms and fought with four swords. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

===Turb of Giants===

''MuCo 25 R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Group Adds +3 to the Size of a standard group of men. The targets’ clothing, armor, and weapons are also increased in size in proportion. This has no impact on their characteristics, but increases their wound ranges accordingly. Ten individuals up to Size +1 can be affected, and at Size +3, their wounds have eight-point increments (1–8 points for a Light Wound, 9–16 for a Medium Wound, and so forth). Casting requisites of Animal,''

[|
''New Guideline: MuCo 5''
''Add or remove human body parts from the target in such a way that he no longer looks human. These parts are normally functional, although a spell may be deliberately designed so that they are not. The Target is Part, not Individual (although Group and higher Targets work as normal).''

|]
''Herbam, and Terram are usually required to affect all the targets’ equipment. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Diam, +2 Group, +1 size, +1 to increase equipment as well)''
''Herbam''

===Halt the Piercing Shafts===

''ReHe(Te) 25 R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind This ward prevents any ranged weapons made of wood and/or metal from harming the caster. Missiles simply drop to the ground at his feet. (Base 15, +1 Diam, +1 Terram requisite)''
''Mentem''

===Breaking the Captain’s Baton===

''PeMe 10 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind The target ceases to be able to coordinate a squad of soldiers as a Trained Group. The memories required to use that skill are removed and do not return when the spell ends, but can be regained with simple demonstration and practice, requiring time but not experience. The target is aware that he has forgotten how to lead warriors in battle. Unless another member of the group is able to take over as leader, the squad fights as an Untrained Group instead. This is a less efficient version of Dissolving the Wall of Shields (Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 70) since it targets only the current leader rather than the entire squad. (Base 4, +2 Voice)''
''Terram''

===Blunting the Iron’s Bite===

''MuTe 10 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind Cast against any bladed weapon, this spell warps and blunts the blade hopelessly.''
''The affected weapon has its total damage (including Attack Advantage) reduced to half (round up). The weapons return to their undamaged state once the Duration expires. While this could be invented as a Perdo Terram spell, Hugh prefers this version since it has the additional effect of making the affected weapons blocked by Magic Resistance. Hugh often casts this spell forcelessly, against the most dangerous-looking of his foes. (Base 1, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +2 affect metal)''

===The Wizard’s Parry===

''ReTe 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The caster deflects one blow from a melee weapon of which he is aware. Since the magus actually touches the weapon, any additional effects of the blade — for example, a coating of poison, or a Blade of Virulent Flame — still affect him. A casting requisite of Herbam is needed if the weapon is primarily wooden, such as a spear or staff. Hugh has mastered this spell, and uses it as a fast-cast defense. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 affect metal)''

===Disarm the Warrior===

''ReTe 10 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind Causes a single object within range to fly towards Hugh; he may attempt to catch it if he wishes by succeeding on a Dexterity + Athletics roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If he chooses not to attempt to catch the item, it falls to the ground by his feet. The spell is very forceful, and has an equivalent Strength of +5; if the object is being held by someone else, then make an opposed Strength roll. If the caster rolls higher then the item is lost to its holder. Hugh usually uses this effect to disarm his opponents, or to retrieve his weapons should they not be to hand. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 sudden and forceful)''

===The Instant Ring Fort===

''ReTe 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part Earth and stone is excavated from a circular ditch around the caster to create a circle of packed earth and rock four paces in diameter, two paces thick, and eight feet high. The spell does not break stone, so any boulders that extend beyond the target are''
''left in place. The ring fort provides an excellent defensive position for holding off a superior enemy, or providing cover for or from archers. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 Size, +1 affect stone)''

===Circular Wall of Shields===

''ReTe 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group Up to twenty shields rise into the air and form a circle around the caster or anyone he designates. Up to ten people can stand within the circle, if they crowd together, but two shields are needed to give adequate defense to each person. The shields slowly rotate around the circle, providing total cover against missile weapons, and limited cover against melee attacks. The shields provide a Defense Total against melee attacks equal to the caster’s Perception + Finesse plus the Defense modifier of the shield in question. If a shield successfully defends against an attack, the base weapon damage is still inflicted directly on the shield. Each shield has a Soak of 3, and if it takes more than 10 points of damage in a single blow, the shield is destroyed and drops to the ground. Destroying shields leaves some individuals in the ring unprotected; but because the shields move, the undefended individuals change each round. If a person is protected by just one shield, then apply the Defense Total to missile attacks as well as melee attacks. From inside the ring, the shields can be plucked from the air; but once this is done, they cannot be replaced. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +2 affect metal)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Hugh has created the gauntlet Tonatris, as described below.''
''Tonatris''
''This enchanted gauntlet is shaped like the caestus used by a gladiator in Roman times; a tough leather glove buckled around the wrist, but with no fingers. The leather is''
''plated with iron, particularly over the knuckles where it forms spikes and heavy plates. The gauntlet was opened with 10 pawns of vis (a small item of base metal), and currently has five pawns-worth of effects.''

===Night-time Thunder===

''ReMe 20 Pen +12, 12/day R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Ind This effect is triggered when the wearer of the gauntlet strikes a being with his thumb between his ring and little fingers. The target falls asleep, and cannot be naturally awakened until the effect’s duration has expired. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Diam; Modifications +4 12/day, +6 Penetration)''

===Vaulting Lightning===

''ReCo 30 Pen +12, 12/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This effect is triggered when the wearer of the gauntlet strikes a being with his thumb between his middle and ring fingers. The target is propelled backwards with incredible force, traveling up to 5 paces. Upon landing, the target suffers +8 damage. The damage is doubled if the target strikes a hard object such as a wall before the range of 5 paces is reached, or if the target lands on a hard surface such as flagstones. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Touch; Modifications +4 12/day, +6 Penetration)''
''Talisman: Troll’s Wife''
''Hugh has enchanted a long-hafted bearded axe as his talisman. He calls this Troll’s Wife, in deference to a Northern tradition to name an axe after a fearsome monster. Only the''
''haft has been enchanted, allowing the blade to be unimpeded by Magic Resistance. The weapon is beautifully made: the head is made of steel with an iron edge, and inlaid silver depicts mythological scenes of heroes slaying dragons and giants. The haft is made of holly wood, perfectly sized to Hugh’s height and reach, and bound in bands of brass. It is carved with horses, eagles, and wolves. Near the axe head are six inlaid discs, three of amber and three of bloodstone. This weapon was made personally for Hugh at great expense, and is of excellent quality (see City & Guild, pages 69–70), granting a +3 to Attack and Defense rolls when using it. The weapon otherwise has the statistics of a pole axe. Troll’s Wife was opened with 12 pawns of vis (the highest cost component is the tiny semi-precious gems near the axe-head), and currently has no room left for further effects as Hugh has not chosen to increase its space just yet.''
''Attunements +3 Corpus (amber) +4 blood and wounds (bloodstone) +4 demons and angels (brass, from Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 137) +7 harm or repel faeries (iron)''

===Wood That Neither Bends Nor Breaks===

''MuHe(Te) 14 Pen n/a, constant effect R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind The haft of the axe becomes as hard as iron, and is virtually unbreakable by mundane means. (Effect: base 4, +2 Sun; Modifications +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger)''

===Fell the Faerie===

''PeVi 23 Pen 20, 6/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This effect is triggered when the wielder of the axe says “ferrum et fraxinus” (“iron''
''and ash”) when striking a creature with the haft; but it only affects entities with Faerie Might. If the effect penetrates, the creature loses 15 Might. (Effect: Base 5, +1 Touch; Modifications +10 Penetration, +3 6/day)''

===Hew the Hell-beast===

''PeVi 23 Pen 20, 6/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This effect is triggered when the wielder of the axe says “os et orichalcum” (“bone and brass”) when striking a creature with the haft; but it only affects entities with Infernal Might. If the effect penetrates, the creature loses 15 Might. (Effect: Base 5, +1 Touch; Modifications +10 Penetration, +3 6/day)''

===Sharpening the Wizard’s Blade of Vim===

''MuVi 28 Pen n/a, 24/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This effect is automatically triggered when the wielder says the word “acuere” (“be sharpened!”) before triggering another enchantment in the talisman that has a unmodified level (that is, excluding Uses per Day, Penetration, and so forth) of 10 or less. The Penetration total of the target effect is increased by 10, which is a total change of effect. This effect can only increase the Penetration of an effect in the item, or the Penetration of the item itself. Hugh invested this effect because when he first created many of the effects in his talisman he was unable to give them a particularly high Penetration total. This effect makes up for that deficiency, even though it adds an extra round to the activation of these effects. It is more economical in terms of enchantment costs than reinvesting the effects he has currently. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Touch; Modifications: +5 24/day, +3 linked trigger)''
