''as a god called Moloch. His devout worshipers sacrificed babies to him, for he has a special hatred of children. The infants were killed by placing them on the outstretched hands of Adramelech’s immense bronze idols, so that they fell into the fire which was lit below the statues. In modern times, he is seen on earth only upon the instigation of some diabolist. If anyone has the temerity to attack him physically, he can produce fire hot enough to melt steel and scorch flesh.

''Order: Masters of the Avengers of Evil''
''The decani are a type of Angel of Punishment, all of whom hold the rank of Master. They are powerful demons of disease, 36 in number, three for each sign of the zodiac. The diseases they cause each affect a different organ of the body, and these ailments are inflicted as a punishment for sin. Atonement is usually not sufficient for a surcease from the pain; suffering often continues until exorcism is sought out. Each decanus is balanced by a specific angel who is capable of providing relief from the disease it inflicts, if this angel can be persuaded to intercede on behalf of the victim. The names of the 36 decani, and the angels specifically designated to counter their diseases, are listed in the Testament of Solomon. The decani appear as typical Avengers of Evil, but appear to be afflicted with the diseases that they inflict.''

''Corpus: This operates in the same way as the Possession Power, except that when a decanus possesses a body, the target becomes riddled with disease. Each decanus inflicts a particular disease, and no amount of medical or magical care effects a cure. The only way to free the victim is to end the possession. The diseases inflicted by decanus possession tend to be long-term and debilitating, requiring a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 every week to avoid suffering a Light Wound, and the recovery roll is based on Stamina only. Typically, a decanus possesses many victims simultaneously with only one Might Point each, and it is capable of dividing its attention equally between all energumen without loss of ability.''

==Famuli==

''Order: False Gods The famuli are amongst the least of the False Gods; they are the demonic familiars given to some diabolists in return for service (see Chapter 9: Infernal Characters, New Virtues). They prove invaluable to such wizards due to their ability to hide the taint of Infernal Powers. At first glance, a famulus appears to be only a small animal (such as a cat, toad, small dog, or the like), but within the animal form is a homunculus of half the size (one point of Size smaller), which can detach itself from the animal and roam independently. By using the Lend Senses Power, a famulus can allow its owner to see or hear whatever is being sensed by the homunculus, as long as the animal half is in physical contact. The homunculus bears more than a passing resemblance to the diabolist to whom the famulus is bonded.''
''An example of a famulus is Lickspitten. Infernal Might: 10 (Animal) Weakness: Running Water Powers: Lend Senses, 1 point, Init 0, Mentem:''
''While in physical contact with another being (the owner, for example), the famulus can lend that being either its hearing or sight. This effect lasts indefinitely, but if the eavesdroppers witness a display of religious sentiment, it is immediately terminated. For example, if a witch borrows the sense of sight, and sees someone cross himself, or views a crucifix, the power of the demon fails. Likewise, if the power of hearing has been borrowed then hearing church bells, the name of God, or a mosque’s call to prayer terminates the Power.''

However, his victim is unaware of the Infernal status of his “guardian angel,” and has instead been told that he is destined for great things, so God has sent an angel to watch over him. Guazzo encourages his charge to do things that work towards his destiny (but which actually work towards a more dubious goal), while punishing him at every opportunity for any character flaws he might display. Guazzo is only appropriate for a character whose player is comfortable with the difference between player and character knowledge.''

''Hutriel (the “Rod of God”) punishes the profligate, particularly those who are extravagant with their wealth. He despises those who use their wealth as a display of status, and those who use it as a means to other sins, such as gluttony and lust. Unfortunately, Hutriel’s zeal in pursuing squanderers often spills over onto those who are merely generous, and the “angel” seems unaware of the difference. While understanding the virtue of charity, Hutriel believes that only “professionals” such as the clergy are qualified to identity the needy and distribute alms with impartiality; others exercising charity are (in his view) doing it for reasons of self-importance. He uses his Obsession of Wastefulness to tempt mortals into profligacy; those who fail his test are doomed to suffer his punishments, for they clearly need to learn the error of their ways and reform. Those undergoing re-education by Hutriel often become misers (thanks to his second Obsession of Frugality). This modus operandi is typical of the Avengers of Evil.''

''Order: Tempters These two manifestations of the same creature are described by their role in sexual intercourse. The incubus, literally the one that lies above, is a masculine form, while the succubus, that which lies below, is a feminine form. They are, however, the same creature, one that uses its capacity to switch gender to harvest the seed of evil men, and convey it to evil women. These demons rarely target those outside the age of virility. An incubus or succubus appears as a handsome or beautiful human being, but can be distinguished from a human because its right hand is on the end of its left arm, and vice versa; the same is true for its feet. These demons take pains to conceal this fact.''
''Sex is a powerful corrupting force in the service of Hell (just take a look at the Book of Leviticus), and there are more demons devoted to it than just the Incubi/Succubae; while these are the most common, they are also the least powerful.

Sometimes a victim is ridden on consecutive evenings, and loses additional Fatigue level each evening. Some powerful sexual demons can cause wounds, or can kill with a single ride, but these lowly spirits cannot. Others can ride victims in their dreams. The target regains the power to move at dawn.''

''Vis: 2 pawns of Vim, in each of his two''
''tongues Appearance: His true appearance is as a''
''pointy-nosed man with a face on both sides of his head. One face flatters his victim, the other criticizes others. He wears the same clothes as his victim, but does not look quite as good in them. When clothed in his Apparition Power, only one of his faces can be seen at a time, but his neck spins to interchange between the two.''
''Nitibus attaches himself to those who have a natural inclination towards criticism. He then encourages this vice at every opportunity, whispering into the ear of his victim to indicate any opportunities that he might have otherwise missed to put others down and belittle their efforts. Nitibus panders to the vanity of his chosen victim (who suffers from the Story Flaw Plagued by a Demon), always pointing out how much better he is than his peers.''

''Order: Tempters The ruchin (singular ruach) are the evil spirits who cause misfortune and illluck, in the vernacular often referred to as imps. It is said that a ruach is released from Hell every time a sin is freely committed, and that one is destroyed every time a selfless act is performed. It is a sad comment on the state of the world that the number of ruchin seems to be increasing day by day.''
''Ruchin appear as vermin: rats, bats, and insects, each with a twisted human face. They are never larger than Size –5.''
''An example of a ruach is Bomburkhan. Infernal Might: 5 (Vim) Weakness: Vulnerability (salt) Powers: Misfortune, 0 points, Init 0, Vim: As agents''
''of misfortune, the presence of ruach causes the worst luck. In games of sheer chance, the odds always favor the opponent of the imp’s target. In other matters where luck is more of a factor than judgment or skill, the target receives a penalty of –2 to any rolls. This misfortune lasts until the ruach grows bored or is driven off.''

''Powers: Honor Among Thieves, 3 point, Init 0, Corpus:''
''Each use of this Power prevents a single thief from revealing a specified secret. If the thief tries to speak the secret, his tongue does not move, and he attracts Valefar’s attention. Valefar then typically ensures that he dies, preferably by being hanged for a theft he did not commit. Itching Thumbs, 1 point, Init +5, Corpus:''
''Each use of this Power grants a thief a +3 bonus on a single roll that allows him to steal. It only aids actual theft, so it aids a pickpocket or window fisherman, but not a housebreaker climbing a wall or a lock picker opening a chest. The Sleep of the Hand of the Thief, 5 points,''
''Init 0, Mentem: This Power makes all people within a building who are asleep unwakable until dawn. Coagulation, 2 points, Init –1, Corpus: See''
''Chapter 4: Infernal Legions, Demonic Powers. Obsession, 1 to 3 points, Init –5, Vim:''
''Larceny. See Chapter 4: Infernal Legions, Demonic Powers. Weakness: Protected Group (those who''
''venerate thieves) Vis: 3 pawns of Corpus, in his left thumb Appearance: Valefar appears as a large''
''hairless lion with the head of a man.''
''Diabolists have many uses for Valefar. His Powers assist conspiracy, and he is one of the demons that teaches how to manufacture magical items out of the remains of hanged criminals. Valefar can also find mandrakes for his masters. His imposing physical presence and knowledge of thievery make him a skilled guard. Because he is of relatively low intelligence, he is easily dominated by a quick-witted master. However, Valefar is not as dim-witted as one might think. He always leads his masters to the gallows before they can repent. He is aware that he is not a skilled schemer, but he knows many demons that are, and he is willing to work under their direction, so long as it always appears that he works alone. His limitation includes members of the Order of Hermes, who venerate Hermes. He therefore hates Hermetic magi and sets his people against them.''

''Order: Tempters The shedim (singular shedeh) are the true tempters of mankind; one of them is assigned to every human being in direct opposition to that person’s guardian angel. However, most people are not aware of their shedeh; those who have the Major Story Flaw Plagued by a Demon may have shedim that they are consciously aware of, that they can see, and that actively try to cause them to stray from the path of good.''
''The shedeh feeds from the yezer ha-ra (evil inclination), which is part of every person, and it is very difficult to shake off the influence of a shedeh, as it seems like an old friend. It may whisper to its target using its Envisioning Power, and such comments appear to come from the victim’s own head (and should be provided as advice from the storyguide with nary a mention of a demon).''
''A shedeh is left powerless if its victim realizes he is being manipulated and makes a positive effort to throw off the demon’s influence. This requires the spending of either a point of Confidence''
''or a point of Faith (perhaps a point of Faith acquired by repenting of the sins committed while influenced by the demon).''
''An example of a shedeh is Nitibus. Infernal Might: 20 (Vim) Weakness: Protected Group (victims''
''who willingly and totally rejects the demon, fueling the rejection with a Confidence or Faith Point) Powers: Apparition, 1 point, Init 0, Imaginem:''
''Shedim may assume an illusory form that only their chosen victims can perceive. To victims, the form appears to be a real person in all respects. Protection of the Close Friend, 0 points, Init''
''+3, Mentem: The chosen victim of a shedeh cannot act directly against it without extreme provocation; it would be akin to attacking one’s own mother. The victim may be as angry as they like with the demon, but actually physically opposing it requires a huge effort of will, which must be repeated every time the victim wants to renew his attacks.''

==Shedim==

''Valefar can teach any individual, whether Gifted or not, to make a hand of glory by taking the hand of a hanged murderer and dipping it in specially prepared wax. Those Valefar has aided in thievery are particularly suitable donors. The hand is fitted with candles made from a noxious wax, with wicks made from the hair of a dead man, so that each finger can be lit like a candle. A hand of glory has five charges, once per finger. Each has the effect described below, which can also be created by Hermetic magic, as the spell Infernal Sleep of the Damned. (Since this Power is identical to a possible Hermetic spell, some magi make Hermetic hands of glory, which need not even be hands; Valefar loathes magi who do this.) The Infernal item has Penetration 0, but does not suffer from Valefar’s weakness unless the demon made it personally.''
''Infernal Sleep of the Damned Re(In)Me 25 Pen +0 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Structure A hand of glory renders most people within a building, other than its holder, unconscious until sunrise or the hand is extinguished, whichever comes first. The hand does not affect brave or pious people (with appropriate Personality Traits at +3 or more), or those possessing relics. Those rendered unconscious cannot be awakened by natural means, which allows them to be bound or murdered while they sleep. The hand may not be doused with water, but can be extinguished with milk or the breath of whoever lit it. The hand will not light if there is anyone awake in the building. Failure to light the hand does not use a charge.''
''(Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Structure, +1 In requisite)''
