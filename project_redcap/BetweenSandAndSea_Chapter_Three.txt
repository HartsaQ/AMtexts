''The Great Desert is not as impassable as it appears to the European imagination. Only about one quarter of the desert is actually sand, and travel across this part of the Great Desert is avoided whenever practicable. The remnant is a mixture of arid land, rock, and gravel; it is difﬁcult to survive due to a lack of water. Characters who know the desert, however, ﬁnd it arduous and unsafe, but passable, even using horses as mounts.''

==The Landscapes of the Great Desert==

''The country was like a leopard’s skin, spotted with inhabited places (which the Egyptians call “oases”) that are surrounded by waterless and desert land... -Strabo (Geography, 2.5.33)''
''There are six types of terrain encountered in the Great Desert. The kind most typically imagined by potential travelers is called erg, the rolling, windswept sand dunes nearly devoid of vegetation. In reality, roughly 20 percent of the desert consists of erg. More common are the stony plains called reg, long stretches comprised of sand and black, red, or white gravel. The actual desert is roughly 70 percent reg. The rest is divided between hamadas (s. hamada), or plateaus and mountainous regions scattered throughout the length of the desert, and chott, salt ﬂats formed in the distant past, or when seasonal wa''
''ter evaporates in a sandy region. True to Strabo’s description, wadis, deep pools of standing water often fed by infrequent rains or springs, and oases (s. wadi, oasis) dot the landscape with life. Even within the harsh environment, places exist where water bubbles up from the earth, or where the seasonal rivers and streams collect in a shady place. These sanctuaries preserve life in an otherwise inhospitable land where''
''the wind howls across the dunes to chew the very life from one’s ﬂesh. Nearly every source of water in the Great Desert is seasonal, a ﬂeeting haven that lingers through the winter and spring only to gradually boil away through the summer and autumn. By comparison, oases offer established and constant sources of food and water, where Berbers, Tuareg, jinn, and an occasional exotic traveler may gather to trade, to talk, or to''

==Hazards of the Great Desert==

''The Great Desert presents a range of hazards that must be overcome if characters are to travel safely within it. The sun burns hot in the deserts, meaning that characters need to take precautions against heat and sunstroke. This includes covering their skin to avoid sunburn and carrying adequate supplies of water to stave off dehydration. The Deprivation check time for lack of water is reduced in the deserts to 4 hours, while the sunlight does +1 non-combat damage if skin is left exposed (see ArM5, pages 180–181). Another (usually natural) hazard of the ergs is dry quicksands, which can swallow a man and his mount in seconds. If a character steps on one of these, he begins to sink immediately and is pulled under within two rounds. Death from suffocation follows if he is not rescued (again, see ArM5, pages 180–181). A character who is caught in an area of dry quicksand may make a Strength or Quickness stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in the ﬁrst round to leap or pull himself free before he sinks a signiﬁcant distance, with a botch indicating that his arms are trapped in the following round.''
''Thereafter it is up to his companions to help him escape its clutches, though if his arms are free he may assist in the second round, reducing any further Ease Factors that he may have to roll against by 3. Thereafter he has been pulled under and is not able to help. Characters also must be wary of brigands, who prey on caravans crossing the deserts. Such robbers are likely to avoid a caravan that is clearly well guarded, but this depends on how desperate they are for goods to support themselves. Sandstorms and dust-storms may suffocate travelers or even strip the ﬂesh from their bones. These may be natural, created by the magic of malevolent sorcerers or the manifestations of elemental jinn. Some may even be witches in disguise. Various other desert jinn and demons seek to harm unwary travelers. In some cases they may use powers that affect the mind or conjure illusions, presenting travelers with visions of lush, palm-ﬁlled oases where they may quench their thirsts. A character may only realize that she has been deceived when she takes her ﬁrst long draught of water, only to ﬁnd her mouth full of sand.''

|}
''rest before continuing on to more hospitable locales. Each of the regions of the Great Desert contains these terrains. There are the Fezzan, the Central Desert, the Tanezrouft Desert in the west, and the Ténéré Desert in the south. Some claim the Fezzan and Ténéré Deserts join with the fabled Nubian Desert, but most consider these to be the thirst-induced ravings of men driven mad by vicious iinn.''

==The Fezzan==

''Sandy ergs comprise most of the Fezzan, though there are many areas of chott and saline depressions which sustain salt-adapted plants, like those in Siwa. In the west, Idehan Ubari Erg and the Great Erg form the boundary with the Central Great Desert. The Libyan Sand Sea forms the eastern boundary with Egypt, and the Al-Hamada alHamra (the Red Plateau) acts as a buffer between the desert and the Mediterranean in the north. In the south, the Ahaggar mountains and the Bilma Erg mark the beginning of the Ténéré. The''
''vast, dark ﬁeld of the Haruj hosts several slumbering volcanoes in the south, their calderas boasting hidden lakes. The Waw an-Namus in the southeastern Fezzan is one such volcano, distinctive due to a layer of black ash which coats its slopes and the surrounding area. This region was once the land of the Garamantian culture (see later in this chapter), but they disappeared with the coming of Islam, leaving only ruins, cemeteries, and a trade route bearing their name as a legacy.''
''AL KUFRA''
''Those arriving in the isolated Al Kufra oasis usually continue southeast, into the Nubian desert, and only rarely turn southwest toward Bilma. Awdjila lies 140 leagues to the north, and Murzuq is 180 leagues to the northwest. Al Kufra is a lonely oasis overlooked by the Tibesti mountains to the southwest and the Bilma Erg to the south. Some consider it a good departure point for distant Fada. The Berber people of Al Kufra live a quiet, simple life, and prefer their business left alone and their visitors transient.''
''Three villages share the oasis: Al Jawf with its rich gardens and date palmeries, the slave-occupied plantation of Ez-Zurgh, and Et-Tleilíb, watching the sands from the southwest corner of the oasis, nearly four leagues from Al Jawf.''
''AWDJILA''
''The oasis of Awdjila is home to the unusual conical domes of the Mosque of Atiq and the tomb of Abdullah ibn Sa‘ad ibn Abī as-Sarh, the foster brother of the Caliph Uthman and former governor of Egypt. The mosque is one of the oldest in Africa, naturally cool and pleasant inside, and it gives the oasis a Divine aura of 4. The people here remain mostly Berber, and speak the Berber language during everyday business within the oasis. Awdjila serves as a crossroads of trails in the region. Caravans arriving from the southern trails or from Egypt to the northeast restock on dates and water before departing. Common routes lead to Al Kufra to the south, and Murzuq to the east-southeast. The route to Murzuq skirts the edge of the Haruj, avoiding''
''the vast ﬁeld of volcanic cones and dark basalt stone, although those who must stop occasionally ﬁnd wadis hidden amongst the black rock. To the north, on the coast, a small village outside some of the ruins of Cyrene has grown in recent years, as the Genoese increase their presence and trade with caravans arriving in the otherwise quiet town. A difﬁcult journey to Egypt stretches to the horizon; Cairo lies 200 leagues to the east-northeast, and Alexandria is roughly 180 leagues to the northeast, both across the treacherous Sea of Sand.''
''DJOFRA''
''The Djofra Oasis consists of three primarily Berber communities: the villages of Sokna, Hon, and Waddan. Sokna has a wall with 7 gates and 33 bastions, as well as a fortress, or kasbah, inside, but the kasbah is poorly maintained. Construction in Sokna consists of a combination of cut stone and un''
''baked brick houses. Hon lies 7 leagues to the northeast of Sokna, and is a small market town. Seven leagues southeast of Sokna, Waddan rises out of an old Roman town with four mithraeums hidden beneath the streets. All three of these towns maintain palmeries of sweet dates, along with some ﬁgs and goats. Waddan occasionally hosts a slave market frequented by jinn, the wares brought from the south as caravans stop on their way north to Tripoli, east to Cairo, or south to Murzuq. Some rest here on their way southwest to Ghat.''
''MURZUQ''
''The town of Murzuq is a popular stop on the Garamantian Road and the Bilma Trail, with caravans using this oasis town as a crossroads between Cyrene, Cairo, Ghat, and points south. It is just south of the Ramlat Dawada region, a swath of red sands, with eleven very salty lakes. One of these lakes is''
''renowned for regularly changing colors from red to green to blue and occasionally even yellow. Another is rich in reddish prawns, which local nomads consume. Thirty leagues northwest lies Ubari, and the ruins of Garama stand between the two. The Djofra oasis is a distant 90 leagues to the north, and Ghat is 75 leagues to the west.''
''UBARI''
''With the dunes of the Ubari Erg looming to the south, this oasis consists of a group of twenty lakes ringed with date palms and rushes. Ruined villages crumble on the shores of several of the bodies of water, and the Tuareg who regularly camp here ﬁsh for small, red shrimp, which they grind into a paste and mold into cakes. While the water in the lakes is extremely salty, wells dug in the area provide fresh water. It is a 28 league journey to Sebha, but a mere 5 leagues to the east, the Garamantian cemetery of Hatya rises out of the sands.''

==The Garamatians==

''Men dwell there called Garamantes, an exceeding great nation who sow on earth which they have laid on the salt...these Garamantes go in their four-horse chariots chasing the Ethiopians. -Herodotus, The Histories, IV.183''
''HISTORY''
''The Garamantian Kingdom once occupied the heart of the Fezzan, with settlements sprawling through out the central Libyan desert from 400 BC to 600 AD. They interacted little with those beyond the sands, raiding for slaves to the south and repulsing the mighty Roman legions until 15 BC, when the Legion III Cyrenaica under Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger sacked several of their towns. The Garamantians became a nominal client state of the Empire, existing in a detente with Rome and ruled by sorcerer-kings, who claimed the feather as their symbol, and an elite cadre of nobility, which hunted nomadic tribes for sport from horse''

==Vis Sites==

''Several locations in the desert harbor vis, a reason for magi to brave its dangers.''
''THE CHANGING LAKE''
''One of the salty lakes near Murzuq changes color over time. Twice a year, as the seasons melt into the next and the colors of the waters change, red sand blows across the lake on the wind. Some of this sand swirls and ﬂoats on the surface near the shore reeds, forming two pawns each of Imaginem and Muto vis. The residents occasionally collect it, incorporating the vis into the pots or bricks they fashion for use in the oasis.''
''WALKING ON GLASS''
''In the Great Sand Sea, east of Al Kufra, there is an area of the desert ﬁlled with chunks of green-white glass. The most luminous and clear pieces revealed on the crests of windswept dunes hold''
''Ignem or Auram vis, and the best pieces hold both. Some very large pieces hold two or three pawns. The area containing these natural vitreous fragments has a Magic aura of 4, but will it remain if all of the vis-bearing glass is collected?''
''THE FOREST OF THE JOBAR''
''Rising out of the sands is a copse of trees made entirely out of dark stone shot through with grey crystal. After terrible sandstorms, some of the trees fall, splitting open to reveal fragments loaded with Terram vis. Strangely, one in ﬁve pawns produced within the crystals is Herbam or Aurum vis, but only in vis found in the spring. Occasionally, a new tree is revealed from the erg. The Tuareg know of this place and avoid it, claiming a great lizard lives nearby. This beast, the “Jobar,” skulks through the dunes under the cover of sandstorms and steals away children. The bones of a few of its kind lay sprawled out across the desert, used as landmarks for traveling nomads.''

''drawn chariots. The Roman Maternus even wrote of accompanying a Garamantian slave-raiding party. Their slaves protected their borders, mined precious stones in the Tibesti mountains to the south, and created the foggaras, or water wells, used to irrigate crops. Their slaves also farmed barley, ﬁgs, grapes, and wheat, and tended herds of shaggy, long-horned oxen while their merchants traded salt, slaves, and wheat with the Romans. This commerce drove the ﬁrst caravans traveling into the desert, acquiring the minerals and human chattel the Garamantians needed to maintain their state. Even in death, slaves served their Garamantian masters. The lords of the Fezzan mastered potent necromantic magics allowing them to control hordes of walking dead, which did not thirst and ignored the biting winds of the desert. These dessicated corpses, blackened by the sun and the Garamantian magics, worked ﬁelds, dug the mines, and served until their forms no longer remained functional. All of this sustained a host of eight cities, scores of villages, and numerous fortresses throughout a line of one hundred kings; the ﬁnal king was taken away in chains by Arab warriors in 668. The last remnants of their culture died out with the coming of Islam, as the Divine auras of worshipping slaves unravelled their rituals and the sharp blades of pressing armies caused most of their corpse-warriors to disintegrate on the wind. Without the unliving legions to stop them, the slaves rose up against the Garamantian nobles, led by the soldierslave caste. In acts of desperation and spite, the surviving lords commanded their few remaining corpse-miners to collapse the tunnels of their foggaras and deny their rebelling slaves the life-giving water that had been pulled from the earth for a thousand years. The remaining slaves and citizenry melted into the local nomadic tribes or emigrated, unable to sustain their kingdom. Without water, without leaders, without slaves or magics, the Garamantians faded away, their cities blanketed by dust and their monuments consumed by the desert.''
''LOST SITES AND CITIES''
''The Garamantians built eight major towns and many other important settlements throughout their territory. They raised fortresses, constructed tombs, established cemeteries, and dug their water collection tunnels, or foggara, out of the rocks and sand, all fairly close to the Roman provinces to the west. Many of these sites are completely lost to the desert sands now, but a few still stand as mute testimony to the people who ruled the area. The bulk of their settlements stand around three oases stretching from Ghat to Murzuq to Djofra.''
''GARAMA''
''Garama is a crumbling ruin of collapsing mud-brick and cut stone structures surrounded by a ring of stunted palms. Residents abandoned the Garamantian capital following the destruction of the last sorcerer-king’s palace and the collapse of its primary foggaras. Scavenging caravans have picked the ruins clean of most useful salvage over the last 500 years, and now only those capable of delving into the earth might ﬁnd lost treasures worth discovering. With over 800 years of trade with Rome and a leg''
''acy that outlasted the Empire by a little less than 200 years, who knows what the last Garamantians secreted away in the hopes of surviving the upheaval. This land was still primarily pagan in those waning years, and its now-ruined Roman temple, established after Balbus’ campaign forced the Garamantians into a token client-state relationship, may have attracted wizards seeking both isolation and the comfort of a familiar setting.''
''ZINCHECRA''
''Built before Garama atop a small plateau on the shores of a small lake and spring just to the north of the capital, very little remains of this settlement. The lake is now a collection of salt ﬂats, but the spring yields some water, keeping a cut-stone fountain partially ﬁlled with water year round.''
''GHAT''
''The Garamantian legacy is visible in the fortress overlooking Ghat, and the necropolis north of town. Dried mudbricks compose the structures of the old town and the population persisted here due to the presence of the oasis, rather than reliance on foggaras.''

==Garamantian Walking Dead==

''Blackened by the sun, wearing nothing more than tattered rags, this creature moves with a deliberate, stuttering action .

''(16–20), Destroyed (21+). Abilities: Brawl 3 (ﬁst) Encumbrance: 0 (0) Equipment: Ragged clothes, occasionally a mining implement of some kind. Vis: There is no vis in a Garamantian Walking Dead. Appearance: A shriveled, leathery corpse, blackened by the sun. Its eyes are pale, milky white and pupil-less.''
''These walking corpses lie motionless unless executing the last commands given to them. They repeat these actions until unable or until the conditions for more important commands occur. Garamantian Walking Dead, if studied for a season, can act as a source of Garmantian Lore or Insight.''

|}
''SARIR TIBESTI''
''Following the narrow veins of tanos gemstones (called amazonite in the modern day), several ancient mines lie hidden in the Tibesti mountains, which demark the boundary with the Ténéré Desert. So remote are these tunnels that the corpse-miners of the Garamantians may still toil unceasingly in the miserable dark. Mindlessly following the ore and the mountain, the unliving bodies may be honeycombing the rock with passages while stockpiling uncut greenblue gems for masters who will never return. In antiquity, tanos was used for signets and seals and provides a +3 Shape and Material bonus when incorporated into such devices.''
''ROYAL TOMBS OF AHRAMAT AL-HATTIA''
''As many as 100,000 tombs stand in silent vigil across the Garamantian lands. Many of these tombs are enchanted with additional powers, giving the sorcerer-kings a distinct boundary marker in so many towns and villages as well as a repository for exquisitely preserved corpses to be animated to perform whatever emergency tasks necessary.''
''WELLS & WATER''
''Hundreds of leagues of tunnels were carved into the rock of the Fezzan, allowing the Garamantians to pull water from the earth. Sand now ﬁlls nearly all of these tunnels. In places, there are still fragmentary passages, but without magical excavation the vast majority of the Garamantian foggara are simply inaccessible. There might still be numerous silent warriors sealed within, waiting for a potent necromaner to command them and put them to good use.''
''LANGUAGE OF GARAMANTIAN MAGIC''
''The Garamantian sorcerer-kings used the Punic language and the Tiﬁnagh alphabet, a script later adopted by the Berber nomads who absorbed their slaves and refugees. There are few remaining instances of this script, on random rock carvings in the Great Desert, some remaining ruins, and a few buried urns. Some murabitin and Berber elders know the language and could teach its rudimentary basics, but no one living in Africa has an effective score greater than 3. No texts regarding their necromantic secrets made it outside the kingdom when it fell, but may remain in a hidden stronghold. Summoned Garamantian ghosts effectively speak the dead language of Punic; however, nobles and merchants probably speak some Latin.''
''GARAMANTIAN GODS''
''The Garamantians venerated god Ammon, whom they called Aman, above all others. This was evident in their incorporation of his name in their own, and his priests in ancient Libya kept a temple at the oasis of Siwah. This temple and its oracle were still venerated and considered potent diviners in late antiquity, but there is little there now but ruins and a small village.''

==Vis Site: The Forgotten Foggara==

''Commanded to dig a new foggara as the rebellion began by a Garamantian noble with hopes of outlasting the turmoil, a group of corpse-miners disappeared from memory when slaves ambushed and killed their master before he could tell his fellows. Left to their task, they dug a vast reservoir beneath a rocky outcropping before water ﬂooded their cave and left them unable to work further. The ﬂowing foggara keeps a small wadi green, and, after rare storms, the overﬂow leaves 5 pawns of Aquam vis in the wadi. Held in the bone fragments of these lost workers which the current carries up to the surface, the vis litters the shore of the wadi. Is the noble’s lost supply cache nearby?''

''TYPES OF GARAMANTIAN MAGIC''
''Garamantian magic was non-Hermetic and both very limited and erratic in the presence of the Divine. It focused on preserving bodies, animating corpses, sensing through a corpse, and commanding corpses. It also had a minor focus on sensing bodies of water. If considered for the purposes of Hermetic research, the rituals allowing a Garamantian sorcerer to bind a horde of corpses without an Arcane Connection to each should be considered a Minor Magical Breakthrough. Success allows the researcher to perform a simple supernatural ritual adding a corpse to a horde which is bound to an object. The Garamantians often used a crown or headdress adorned with a feather. A caster wearing the bound object may use the Voice and Group levels of effect for spells affecting or working through the horde, even if they remain at an Arcane Connection distance or have numbers far exceeding a usual Group. This ritual has no Penetra''
''tion, only works on mundane corpses, and cannot persist in a Divine aura. Any recovered bonded objects can be researched as a source of Garamantian Lore or Insight, depending on their state. (See Ancient Magic, page 8 ) Hermetic Intellego magic far exceeds Garamantian methods for sensing water in the desert. However, relics of such sorceries may help a researcher better understand Garamantian methods or assist with the translation of works written in Tiﬁnagh. Buried in an urn in a small cave near Zinchecra, an initiation script in Tiﬁnagh Punic details the last recorded method for gaining the Garamantian ability to Dowse for water. (See ArM5, page 64 for the Dowsing ability.) To selfinitiate this Virtue (Target Level 18), one must travel to the cut-stone pool of Zinchecra during the autumnal equinox (+3) after properly mummifying and entombing 10 individuals in Garamantian tombs (+3). There, one must take a purifying bath in the pool under the light of the moon while undergoing ritual scarring — which provides the equivalent of the Blatant Gift (+9). Upon exiting, if one’s (Garamantian Lore + Presence + Initation Script bonus) value is greater than 18, one gains the virtue of Dowsing for drinking water. However, locating and deciphering this script may prove to be full arc in itelf. (See The Mysteries: Revised Edition page 13)''

==The Central Great Desert==

''The Central Great Desert is bounded by the Mediterranean in the north and the Ahaggar mountains in the south. The Ubari Desert makes up its eastern border, the Grand Western Erg and the Tademaït Plateau account for its western. The terrain consists mainly of erg sand dunes, rocky hamadas, and dry valleys. More than any other part of the Great Desert, the Central dDsert is very dry, rarely graced with rain, and with scant vegetation, even in the wadis. The Ahaggar mountains are tall peaks of hard, black rock formed into pinnacles, towers and crests, like huge pieces of volcanic basalt splintered and carved with an unimaginably large knife.''

|style="padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px"|

==The Iter Praeter Caput Saxi==

''Outside of the ruins of Roman Lepcis lies the entrance to a thin linear level 5 Magic regio that crosses the Fezzan, bypassing the old territory of the Garamantes and stretching for hundreds of miles to reach the fabled mountains of Agisymba. The Bab Ras al-Hammada or “Road Past the Stone Heads” is mentioned by Pliny as the secret route taken by the Roman general Valerius Festus in the ﬁrst century AD. The northern and southern entrances to the regio lie within small Magic auras of strength 2 and are each marked by an overgrown Roman milestone radiating faint Mercurian magic. Unless entered from near the milestones, the narrow width of the magic road makes it impossible to ﬁnd without the guidance of a Camel of Virtue (see Appendix: Mundane Bestiary). Although remarkably secure, the area within the regio consists only of a repeating loop of narrow desert track broken every few miles by a brackish well or watering hole, making it unsuitable for use as a hidden covenant site.''
''A COVENANT IN AGISYMBA?''
''Agisymba itself lies deep to the south, a land of high mountains surrounding a vast lake, populated by giant creatures such as the legendary monoceros and cameleopard, and rich with wild areas that contain abundant undiscovered vis sources. A small tribe of Plinian troglodytes inhabit the caves here, hiding from humans due to their collective memory of past Roman slave raids but, they may make useful grogs for a Hermetic settlement. The distant mundane location, potential for untapped magical resources, and easy access via the Iter Praeter Caput Saxi may make this an attractive settlement site for isolationist magi seeking to distance themselves from the wider Order of Hermes. Alternatively, intrepid characters interested in constructing a menagerie of exotic creatures or seeking a unique familiar may be tempted to seek out this lost plateau.''

==Story Seed: The Vexillation of the Fata Morgana==

''Acting upon visions seen by diviners in House Tremere of an impending Mongol invasion, a vexillation was created and sent into the desert of the Fezzan, using the cover of being a Genovese trading caravan. Charged with ﬁnding and establishing an emergency redoubt in the foggaras of the Garamantians, these Hermetic magi are fanatic about keeping their location and goals secret. What happens when the player characters accidentally scavenge one of their supply caches, or encounter the magi and discover their purpose amidst the crumbling ruins of the desert? Can a reasonable solution be found, or will the Tremere act with violence to protect the secrecy of the dedicated mission of their vexillation? Will a Wizard War conducted beyond the borders of Mythic Europe still follow the conventions of the Order, or can the two groups ﬁnd a way to resolve the situation?''

|}
''The Tuareg call the Ahaggar mountains “Atakor,” the place of stone, but the high peaks create pockets of habitable land jealously guarded by nomadic tribes and hunted by packs of painted dogs. Just north of the Ahaggar rises the Tassili n Ajjer, the “plateau of rivers,” with hundreds of natural rock arches, many stands of cypress, myrtle, and wild olive trees, and dozens of petroglyphs. The nomadic tribes consider the area sacred and the Wind Spirits (see later) often relax here.''
''DJANET''
''This is a small Tuareg and Berber oasis tucked into a valley on the western side of the Tassili n Ajjer plateau. A community one might consider to be no more than an agglomeration of villages maintains the large date palmery for trade with caravans on the Garamantian or Ghadames Roads. More than a dozen natural rock arches stand within 7 leagues of Djanet, one of which very closely resembles an elephant, though it is far larger than any mundane elephant could ever be. A few rare and esoteric texts penned by lost scholars of the Fay claim these arches to be door''
''ways into a regio network, but even if the tales are true, none have returned to tell where the paths lead. Djanet is roughly 25 leagues southwest of Ghat, and 125 leagues south of Ghadames.''
''GHADAMES''
''Ghadames is controlled by seven clans of Berbers who have divided the city into as many districts, each with its own souk. The city is surrounded by a stout wall and the Ain al-Faras oasis lies at its heart. The Third Legion garrisoned the city for nearly 200 years and its crumbling, abandoned fort stands on a nearby hilltop to the southwest. Notably, covered walkways connect most of the buildings, creating a maze-like warren of alleyways which very effectively insulates the population from the worst heat, but conceals the activities of bandits and cutthroats who might prey on the unwary traveler. This also has the effect of creating a large number of lacunae in Ghadames, spaces where the city’s normal Divine aura of 3 does not reach.''
''GHARDAIA''
''Ghardaia Oasis consists of ﬁve fortiﬁed villages, called ksours, conﬁgured with identical designs. The ﬁve villages are Ghardaia, Melika, Beni Isguen, Bou Noura and El Atteuf. Each boasts its own mosque with the minarets functioning as watch towers. The houses are built around the mosque in concentric circles and surrounded by a high wall, making each village more of a citadel. For protection, residents store grain and weapons in the mosque, but spend most of their time outside the citadel, tending the date palmeries during the summer months.

==Myrtle of Virtue==

''In some hidden wadis grow Myrtle Trees of Virtue. Their leaves and berries are highly valued by a number of people. The Sardinians make a liqueur from the crushed berries called Mirto. The murabitin ﬁnd it augments their dream interpretation. Amongst Jewish scholars, myrtle is considered to be both the symbol and scent of Eden. Certain theurgic practitioners ﬁnd a sprig of myrtle on their tongue enhances their casting technique. A sprig of leaves with either a ﬂower or berry contains 2 pawns of Mentem vis. It can be enriched in a number of ways. In its berry form, it can be fermented in a silver urn underground for a season, at which point a draught taken from the urn will provide the consumer a +3 bonus to all recovery rolls for a season. In its ﬂower form, an enriched sprig provides the bearer with the Clear Thinker Virtue. To enrich the myrtle, the person who intends to use it must sleep with the sprig under their pillow for a season. Alternatively, some Jewish traditions dictate that the myrtle must dry in the Holy of Holies, and be struck by the light of the rising sun each day for a season. If a myrtle is kept soaking in seawater for a season in a place sacred to Aphrodite, it will remain supple and appear fresh, granting the bearer the Venus’ Blessing Virtue.''

==The Great Desert Regio Network==

''Deep within mundane deserts lie small nondescript Magic auras leading to higher regiones, unmarked except for slight shifts in the shape of the largest dunes and the shimmer of the air in the baking sun. Known to Camels of Virtue and the deep desert nomads such as the Bedouin of the Empty Quarter of Arabia or the Tuareg of the great Sahara, many of these regiones connect into one large regio network. Within the regiones lie similar landscapes to the deserts they touch on in the mundane world and travelers may encounter other wayfarers or fantastic desert beasts that act as guardians of the magical highway. Other paths lead only to dead ends or featureless expanses of sand where thirst and heat block the intruders from progressing or escaping. Characters with the (Desert) Regio Network Minor Virtue (see Realms of Power: Magic, page 45) can use these''
''deep desert regiones to travel quickly across the desert sands from one location to another by entering into a regio and exiting at a different mundane location. The Tuareg call this phenomenon tinariwen (Tuareg: “the deserts”), referring to the multiple landscapes and geographic variation within the region. Some mundane Tuareg and the mysterious Blue Men can navigate them. This allows the nomads to engage in lightning raids and then retreat, seemingly to simply melt away into the deep sands. Some travelers may even be able to move from one desert to another — the Sahara of North Africa, the Empty Quarter of Arabia, the Nefud of Syria, the Kyzylkum and Karakum of Transoxiana, the Taklimakan beyond the Roof of the World, and even other unknown deserts in lands outside of Mythic Europe may be linked in this way.''

''founded the village of Ghardaia in the 11th century, venerating the female saint Daïa who inhabited a cave (ghār) in the valley. While the other villages have Divine auras of 3 due to their close, enclosed construction with their respective mosques, Ghardaia’s mosque, with its relics of Daïa, has an aura of 4.''
''GHAT''
''Often called “The Last Oasis” by those travelling the Garamantian Road, Ghat sits on the eastern edge of the Tasili n Ajjer, with the Idehan Ubari Erg to the north and the Bilma Erg to the south. This is something of a misnomer, as Djanet is just 25 leagues to the southwest, although Ghat is off the trade route’s regular path to Bilma. Like Ghadames, it also utilizes numerous covered walkways between buildings to reduce the impact of the heat on residents. A small fort watches over the town from atop a rocky outcropping to the southwest and an ancient cemetery, ﬁlled with short Garamantian grave pyramids, stands to the north of the town.''
''WARGALA''
''This oasis is another of the few strongholds of the Ibadi Muslims, a sect which believes any Muslim may lead the community and reserves the right to revolt against an unjust or heretical leader. Many of their number ﬂed here from Tahert after the fall of the Rustamid Imamate in the early 10th century. There are also Ibadis in the neighboring Ghardaia oases and on the island of Djerba. A large mosque occupies the town square and the city’s protective wall boasts six separate gates. The souk is noted for its arcade, providing shade to many of the vendors and for its active slave market, patronized by the jinn of the area. Date palm groves, and fruit and vegetable gardens ﬂourish all around the city, fed by the oasis and their products sold in the market.''

==The Redoubts of the Tuareg==

''The Tuareg dominate an area in the southern central reaches of the Great Desert, centerd on the great mountainous plateaus, but can be found anywhere within the conﬁnes of the sand. Within the Tazenrouft to the west and the greater expanse of the Tenere to the east and southeast, a string of waterless and otherwise inhospitable Magic auras almost encircles this cluster of mountains, except to the north where caravan route enters the Haggar massif. This makes the Tuareg homelands almost inaccessible without access to the Great Desert Regio Network — a multitude of regiones that are known to lead from the sands around the rocks and connect to other sites within the Sahara and perhaps other distant deserts (see the nearby insert).''
''AHAGGAR''
''This remote and uninviting plateau rising above the desert dunes, with its central cluster of peaks referred to in Tamahak as the Atakor. is the spiritual home of the Tuareg and their sanctuary against their enemies. The desolate peaks and valleys ﬁlled with cooled lava make the area seem a forlorn and forbidding region that shimmers lilac in the setting sun — a land seemingly as abandoned by God as the nomads that call it home.''
''Despite its isolated location the massif is home to a variety of raptors such as eagles, but the soil supports only the grazing of the lesser caste Kel Ulli tribes’ goats and sheep. The Tuareg of the Kel Ahaggar dwell predominantly in the dark canyons around the periphery of this range. Within the central Atakor area stand the highest peaks of Tahat, Ilaman, Amjer, Tiouyen, and Iherhe. The Tuareg believe the spirits of the peaks are rivals in love and that their current positions are the result of their quarrels. At the base of Ilaman lies a spring formed when the jealous Amjer struck his brother’s shoulder, the water of which is a liquid form of Terram vis. The more remote and highest regions of the plateau are pocked with Magic auras. Within the more violently jagged clefts at their bases are nestled small Infernal auras, inhabited by demons and Infernal jnun of the Orders of the Aerial Powers and Furies that subject the gueltas or valleys to ﬂash ﬂoods from paroxysmal torrents.''
''TAMANGHEST''
''A gem nestled in the bosom of the Ahaggar mountains near the edge of the Tassili n Ajjer plateau, Tamanghest is a rich oasis that supports groves of lemons, dates, ﬁgs, and almonds. Millet and wheat grow here, and the Tuareg keep small herds of goats for meat and milk. The herders of this village consider themselves the guardians''

==The Cypresses of the Desert==

''The Tuareg hedge magicians use the wood from these cypresses to create their most powerful creations, but must beseech the spirits of the trees to sacriﬁce timber for their labors. A fallen limb from an individual tree contains Vim vis which grants different powers or Virtues to the supplicants as per the examples below:''
''Tin-Balanan  Puissant Leadership  Tin-Ambarak Puissant Ride  Tin-Gaded  Wilderness Sense  Tin-Tamanzazt Lesser Immunity: Thirst''
''The enrichment processes are known to wandering male inenden hedge magicians, who must be bargained with or coerced to give up their hedge secrets.''
''Ancient Cypress wood: +3 spirits, +3 necromancy''

|}
''of the cypress in the Tassili n Ajjer, and have named all of the trees on the plateau, which is blanketed with a Magic Aura of 2. Many of the trees have their own genius loci spirits, which have similar protective feelings for the Tuareg. Few come to this tranquil place and its ochre-colored homes without the blessing of the region’s nomads; it is an open secret, known among the tribes as a place to trade and rest, but no outsiders are invited to visit. Almost 17 leagues to the west lies the haven of Abalessa and the sealed tomb of Tin Hinan, reputed to have healing properties.''
''TASSILI N AJJER''
''The northern massif known as the “Plateau of Rivers” is a rocky upland scored by deep gorges and hidden gueltas. Ancient cypresses, known to the Tuareg as tarout, cluster in the higher eastern uplands of the Tassili n Ajjer. Each is over 2000 years old, gnarled and twisted, with its own personality. The oldest stand in a grove in the stony Wadi Amazar. Led by Tin-Balalan (Tuareg: “the one with the pool at its feet”), the trees are each the physical manifestation of powerful genius loci. Knowledgeable beyond man, each tree is a Magic guardian of their local area, similar to the elder trees of the German forests (see Chapter 4: The Forest, Guardians of the Forest, or Realms of Power: Magic, page 106).''
''AÏR''
''This southern collection of nine circular volcanic outcrops is noted for its graven rock art, including a rock carved with pair of strange long-necked creatures that resemble the cameleopardalis mentioned in Pliny. Each of these sites marks the location of a strong Magic auras (at least strength 4) aligned to the Art of Animal or Terram, and they are valuable to Tuareg hedge wizards, although they unusually do not claim responsibility for creating the petroglyphs. The stone artwork seems to unduly attract packs of wild dogs with spotted hides that resemble jackals. The painted dogs must be dealt with or driven away to use the sites for magic rites. The tallest peak of the plateau, Idoukal-n-Taghès, rises above the pilgrimage village of Abatol and hosts a Magic regio where the climate is similar to the Mediterranean. Within the Herbam-aligned aura grow a number of plants and herbs''
''not normally found in the desert, including examples of common European Herbs of Virtue.''
''ADAGH''
''Lying beyond the feared waterless Tanezrouft to the north, this sandstone massif is pocked with predominantly Faerie auras rather than Magic auras like the other three massifs. Sometimes known as the Adrar Ifoghas after the Kel Ifoghas tribe that claim the area, its rock art shows mainly scenes from nomad life, and appears to move and change from one visit to the next.''

==Tanezrouft, the Western Great Desert==

''Bounded on the west by the Atlantic, the Tanezrouft’s long eastern border consists of the Western Erg, the Tademaït Hadama and the Ahaggar Mountains of the Central Great Desert, and the Bilma Erg of the Ténéré. In the north, the Chech Erg pushes against the Atlas Mountains, and there are few in this lonely region except the caravans and the most hardy of Tuareg nomads. The winds often sweep away the tracks of fellow travelers, and those lingering behind easily become lost or prey to the hyenas or jackals, which need no water.''
''IWALATAN''
''A wonder of cut-stone structures, the town of Iwalatan is the southern terminus of the Walata Road and the Taghaza Trail. The Massufa Berbers maintain a few groves of date palms here, growing melons in their shade and keeping herds of sheep. The many wells of this oasis produce crisp, clean water, water made all the more refreshing by the long, dry trip required to reach Iwalatan. Timbuktu is 100 leagues to the east-southeast, while the salt mines of Taghaza are 165 leagues to the north-northeast. The Walata Road leaves to the northwest, while the Taghaza Trail departs to the north. Several mosques grace the town, giving it a Divine aura of 3.''

==Saga Seed: An Atakor Covenant?==

''Isolated from the rest of the Order by mundane distance, the desert, and ﬁerce nomad tribes, a the bastion of the Tuareg may at ﬁrst seem an unlikely site for a Hermetic covenant or even a cooperative of sahir from the Order of Suleiman. But all these features may make it a desirable site for a group of wizards seeking to escape the political intrigues and mundane obligations of their traditional homelands, albeit at the price of extreme isolation. Although aggressive and possessed with an unequalled sense of racial superiority, once they have been subdued or allied with the Tuareg nomads make excellent covenfolk with their adaptions to desert lifestyle and familiarity with the shifting regiones surrounding the massifs. The harsh geography and supernatural barriers provide a measure of protection against both mundane and supernatural interference and the abundance of untapped magical resources and powerful Magic auras provides a fertile base for magical experimentation or incursions into the Magic Realm.''

==Faerie Tuareg and the Jnun==

''Although some of the southern Tuareg tribes such as the Kel Ifoghas, Iwellemmeden, and Kel Geres have a large number of Faerie blooded individuals, it is the Kel Asouf, or “People of the Empty Spaces,” that are the true Faerie jnun of the deserts. These Faeries generally resemble the varied jinn of the more Muslim dominated lands to the north but are wilder and generally darker in behavior.''

|}
''SIJILMASA''
''Founded by Berbers in 757, Sijilmasa lies on the trade route to Tangier, struggling to survive on the caravans of salt, gold and slaves headed in either direction. The wealth garnered long ago in the large marketplace in the western quarter of the city translated into high, strong, ochre-colored walls protecting the many stately temples and Suﬁ madrasas in the city. For more regarding Sijilmasa, see Chapter 2: Coasts.''
''TASARAHLA''
''Really no more than a place in the dunes where a spring of water oozes from the ground, Tasarahla has a few rings of stone for travelers’ ﬁre pits and a couple of low walls to help shield tents. The spring, such as it is, is marked by a moderately sized stone and small patch of mud. New arrivals must often dig to clear the well of windswept debris and wait for a short while before being able to gather water. The ﬂow of water here is slow, but steady. Taghaza lies roughly 10 days journey north, about 53 leagues, and Iwalatan is about 75 leagues to the south-southwest.''
''TAGHAZA''
''Not truly an oasis, or even a wadi, Taghaza is a barren mining town carved out of a rich chott. There are no trees, just salt pits, sand, and the homes of the Masufa Berber tribe’s all-male slaves. Built from blocks of salt and roofed with camel hides, their thresholds all face west due to a tradition claiming evil jinn in the region cannot enter a structure from that direction. An Infernal aura of 3 lends credence to this belief. A slightly less rudimentary way-station for the foreign merchant caravans stands on the eastern edge of the settlement. The only food available is camel meat, or dates and millet brought in by caravans; many of the slaves perish when caravans are delayed. Taghaza seems perpetually plagued by ﬂies and everyone considers the water brackish. Despite these miserable conditions, the town is awash with gold and exotic goods, brought by merchants from the south, which residents use in conjunction''
''with salt to trade with arriving caravans from the north for slaves and manufactured goods. The Chech Erg stretches to the north and the El Djouf desert makes the 165-league trip south to Timbuktu a foolhardy trek reserved for only the most dedicated caravans. Iwalatan is closer, only 125 leagues south-southeast. For those headed to the Maghreb, Sijilmasa is roughly 20 days to the north.''
''TUWAT''
''This string of oases stretches for about 30 leagues at the edge of the Tanezrouft and the Central Great Desert. It boasts large stands of hundreds of date palms irrigated by seasonal pools and supplemented with foggaras, or wells carved into the rock to access the fossil water deep below. There are four fortiﬁed villages in the area, with thick walls and watchtowers, called ksours (s. ksour). The people in the small villages of Buda in the north and Reggane in the south maintain the foggaras. The other two ksours tend the date palm groves. The steep sandstone walls of the Tademaït Hadama, some rising to 500 paces, ring the oases along its southern and eastern edges, while numerous sand dunes slouch from the north and west, punctuated in places with sandstone outcrops. The sirocco wind often blows quite hard here and occasionally attacks caravans.''

==Ténéré Desert==

''The nine massifs of the Aïr Mountains overlook the Ténéré Desert. A Tuareg stronghold since time forgotten, the Aïr range is pocked with many acacia-shaded wadis, full after the rains of early autumn. Painted dogs hunt in packs, trying to steal from the herds of goats and camels kept by the nomads. The Erg of Bilma lies at the heart of the Ténéré, swaddling the Aïr range, and the Tibesti Mountains separate it from the Libyan Desert. The Ennedi Hamada rises up out of its southern border, where some claim one can see the Nubian Desert or stare into the haze of the Torrid Zone.''

==Story Seeds==

''WAGES OF SIN''
''The ﬂies of Taghaza are, in fact, the physical manifestation of a horde of False God demons. The gold distributed to greedy souls throughout Mythic Europe must come from somewhere, and with so much gold passing through the hands of so many in a place where death is commonplace and theft between slaves often resolved with murder, demons leverage the situation to their advantage, making a harsh locale even more sinful and miserable. Whenever a sack of gold is needed to tempt a weak-willed fool, the demons whisk what they need from these awful hovels and transient caravans. A devout magus who discovers this vast stockpile of wealth must not only grapple with his own feelings of greed, but consider if a larger blow might be dealt to the plans of Infernal if an easy cache of gold were no longer available.''
''BREAKING THE BONDS''
''The slaves of Taghaza are cruelly imprisoned – while free to roam unfettered, they are imprisoned by the surrounding waterless desert and their complete reliance on imported food and supplementary fresh water from the merchant caravans of the southern gold traders. Hermetic magi may seek to disrupt this status quo without realizing the true nature of the slaves and the salt trade. Characters willing to provide a magical means of supplying food would greatly unbalance the economy here, but whether the salt slaves would welcome a change in overlord is questionable. The southern traders, also reliant on the salt produced here, may negotiate with gold or else resort to desperate violence to reclaim their prize. Another large salt mine, Taodeni, lies undiscovered further south, but distant from the current trade route. Hermetic magi who discover and settle this new site, harvesting the salt''

|}
''AOUDERAS''
''This small oasis, nestled amongst the massifs of the Aïr, is populated mainly by Tuareg and their slaves, who trade for supplies with caravans in exchange for water, shelter, and palm dates. Most of the population lives within a hilltop fortress, protecting the well and their harvest from the raiding tribes and jinn who prefer bloodshed to trade. Timia is 15 leagues to the northeast, through the narrow and treacherous canyons of the Aïr Mountains. Bilma is 120 leagues to the east-northeast, across the Erg of Bilma.''
''BILMA''
''Nestled under the Kaouar Cliffs and protected from the desert dunes, Bilma is the largest town before continuing north to Siwa or east into Nubia. It is known for its gardens, for salt mines, and date palm groves. Caravans often consider Bilma the last destination of one of the caravan routes before either returning to Egypt and Cyrenica or plunging back into the reputed lands of the fabled Sorcerer-King. Those traveling north need only go ﬁftyﬁve leagues before reac ing the oasis fortress of Djaba. Fachi is due west through the rolling dunes.''
''FACHI''
''A lonely citadel carved from volcanic rock in the middle of the Bilma Erg, Fachi functions much like Aouderas — mining blocks of salt and trading water and palm dates for other supplies from caravans to survive. A few sweet lakes of fresh water mean most traders are more than willing to exchange their wares for the chance to replenish their supplies before pressing on the 65 leagues either east to Bilma or west to Timia. Fachi has a Magic aura of 4 due to its unspoiled nature and lack of a mosque.''

==Story Seeds (Cont’d)==

''with the aid of their magic, may similarly draw attention from the existing power brokers of the region. Due to the harsh environment, Taghaza and Taodeni are particularly inhospitable — any inhabitants suffer a –3 on any Aging rolls due to the terrible living conditions (see ArM5, page 170) in addition to any effects of Warping inﬂicted by the local aura, making it a difﬁcult location to maintain for a covenant without magical means of easing the perils.''
''WHERE DOES ALL THAT SALT GO?''
''The rock salt is mined in pits beneath the merciless heat of the sun and cut into large slabs which are lashed onto either side of a camel for the annual salt caravan known as the Azalai. Once loaded onto the camels, the salt leaves to the south, but none of the miners or overseers are aware of its ﬁnal destination. Two to three months later, the camels return with fresh slaves, gold, ivory, and other exotic goods bound for the northern markets of the Tell, which is good enough for the visiting northern traders of the Mafusa, who have learnt not to ask questions and just enjoy the proﬁts. Even the caravan guides are circumspect about their destination, seemingly unable to describe the exact proceedings''
''and negotiations that resulted in their new wares. The guides seem to become more distant and taciturn the more journeys they complete and ﬁnally they stop returning altogether, only to be replaced by distant relatives with similar names and remarkably similar physical features. Although the majority of goods are mundane, some of the more exotic items are touched by Faerie or contain Faerie tainted vis. Is this because the Azalai’s ﬁnal destination lies within Arcadia, where the salt is exchanged or transformed into the other trade goods and captured humans have their memories altered and are transformed into black-skinned versions of themselves to be sent as slaves to the north? At least one of the salt caravan’s merchants is a disguised Faerie with the Spirit Away power (see Realms of Power: Faerie, pages 23–24) and the caravan guides are either humans that become irreversibly Warped until they are lost to Arcadia themselves or minor associated faeries that help round out the story. Alternatively, the caravan could be led by demons charged with punishing sinners — in this scenario the slaves retain enough of their former memories to recall fragments of their past lives but their exact origins are obscured by Infernal powers. Taghaza then represents a form of mundane purgatory.''
''THE MINES OF DESPAIR''
''The slaves mining the salt have had their wills broken by their imprisonment and nearly all of the mundane miners brought here develop the Weak Willed Flaw from Warping, due to constant exposure to the powers of the mining site’s Infernal occupants. Most believe, equivalent to the possession of the Delusion Flaw, that they come from lands beyond the edge of the Great Desert but their accounts are fragmentary — the only common element is that they remember being brought to Taghaza to work incessantly in the gruelling pits, and that they miss their families. This belief is not true, but the truth cannot be readily discerned by either mundane or magical means. Some of the miners and overseers are in fact incognizant dark Faeries (or demons), whose role is to continue the story and feed off the despair and the suffering of the true human slaves. The powers of these malevolent creatures further warp the memories of the mundane miners and female slaves.''
''FADA''
''This small Tuareg town is situated a day’s journey north-northwest of the greatest stone pool of the Great Desert. While it is a wadi ﬁlled only by the seasonal rains, it never dries out because it lies at the foot of vast cliffs of watercarved stone. Ringed by trees, the wadi supports a population of camels, crocodiles, and other strange creatures. Ex''
''tremely isolated, reaching Fada requires a 200 league journey east-southeast from Bilma. Only those seeking the fabled Nubian Desert or seeking to cross the Torrid Zone come here.''
''TAKEDDA''
''The last western outpost of the Bilma Trail, this Tuareg-occupied oasis''
''boasts copper mines and date palm plantations. It is rumored to owe fealty to a wizard named Sogolon Conde. Beyond Takedda to the west lie the “Lands of Thirst,” the deep desert and the routes to the purported realm of the SorcererKing of Sosso. It is 45 leagues east across the Bilma Erg to the Aïr Mountains and the shaded havens of Aouderas or Timia.''

''The sandy colored fur of the Pale Fox of Virtue allows it to blend into the dunes as it ranges across the length of the Great Desert. It has large ears, short legs and a narrow muzzle. Its hide becomes a lighter ivory shade near the belly and its tail darkens to a sooty tip. Living in small family groups, the foxes enjoy hunting difﬁcult''
''prey and managing elaborate ruses to steal kills from hunting tribesmen. Under the hot midday sun, the Pale Fox of Virtue rests in cool burrows extending 10 paces into the earth. At twilight, they venture out and forage. Able to survive without water, they often hunt from the deep desert. Consummate tricksters, Pale Foxes of Virtue take great joy from a well-constructed deception or a lengthy chase, drawing out the pursuit with repeated, but brief, glimpses or “fortunately” discovered tracks. They seek out hunters, both to taunt and to steal kills. The Fox’s tail may be Enriched by lining the hood of a cloak or boots. The material of the hood or boots must be the ﬁnest gazelle hide and crafted only by moonlight. The wearer of such boots is granted the Puissant Stealth Virtue while the wearer of such a cloak gains the Puissant Guile Virtue. The tail may be fashioned into only one such item.''
''STORY SEED: THE STOLEN PRIZE''
''Having snatched an item, like a bow, a satchel, or a waterskin, from a traveling character, the Pale Fox of Virtue makes a bargain: if a lone character can catch it, it promises to show the group a vis site, a short cut through a regio,or perhaps a caravan once buried by the dunes and now uncovered by the wind. The Pale Fox of Virtue enjoys a good play on words as much as a proper chase, and so it will readily accept clever characters’ attempts to reinterpret the rules of the challenge, as long as words remain unchanged. For instance, simply because a lone character must catch the Pale Fox, that does not mean only a lone character can chase it.''
''TIMIA''
''Tuareg command this valley paradise, renowned for its enormous, deep stone well, which is ﬁlled with dark water and called a “guelta.” The guelta never empties, and Timia supports small orchards of fruit trees. The road from Aouderas to Bilma passes through Timia, with 65 leagues of rolling sand dunes ahead of travelers before their next true rest in Fachi. To the west lies Takedda and Aouderas is just to the south.''

==Trade across the Sands==

''A number of routes crossed the Great Desert on the backs of camels and slaves. The journey is performed in stages, each of roughly 7 leagues (21 miles), and a trip in one direction usually requires between two and three months. Trade ﬂows into''
''and out of the desert, but gold, slaves, and salt drive the trafﬁc north, and all manner of goods, but primarily slaves, glass and horses, go south. Some of the other goods taken north include ivory, gum arabic, ostrich feathers, kola nuts, ebony, and cloth. Caravans going south take dates, ﬁgs, sugar, cowries, copper, ironwork, paper, books, tools, weapons, cotton, and silk to serve as currency with the nomads, in addition to the highly prized commodities. The caravans also gather salt for trade in either direction, loading camels with two large slabs pulled from mines in the desert. Thousands of slaves cross the sands every year, often forced to carry the other goods caravans intend to trade. Malnourished and rarely given enough water, many are expected to die along the way as a cost of doing business. Moorish pirates capture pagans from Rus, Christians from the Mediterranean and England, and the most unscrupulous even take Muslims from Iberia and the Levant, despite laws forbidding such practices. Slaves arriving from the south in the markets of the Maghreb are mainly women, and cost roughly 3–9 Mythic''
''Pounds each. Occasionally, however, a local leader decides to bolster his forces with slaves, like the founder of Marrakesh, who purchased 2,000 men to ﬁght in his campaign to consolidate power in the Maghreb. Berber and Tuareg nomads make up the majority of the traders from the south, bringing caravans with hundreds of camels and slaves into the markets twice a year, in March and November. Muslim traders also make this trip, bringing their wares into the desert and returning with gold and slaves. The Genovese have established a bustling trade all along the coast since the mid-11th century, with enclaves in Saﬁ, Sale, Tangier, Orano, Algiers, Bona, Tunis, Mahadia, and Tripoli. There, they trade primarily for gold, timber, salt, cheese, wine, olive oil, and grain, but cannot help but partake in the slave trade. Many households have two or three slaves purchased from the markets here. However, it is illegal in many places to keep Christian slaves, and if these servants convert, their owners are supposed to free them. This helps maintain northbound demand. Rumors from the returning merchants speak of a nominally Muslim kingdom across the sand, ruled by a powerful Sorcerer-King. Such stories are dismissed, however, as madness induced by howling winds and the solitude of the long journey. It is interesting to note, though, that something is demanding slaves for trade at the route destinations, and the merchants currently remain silent regarding their buyers.''

==Arranging Caravans==

''Trade across the Great Desert is a lucrative process, but one ﬁlled with danger, so merchants must co-operate to survive. Each merchant chooses which city his goods will depart from, and where they will be traded away. He then loads them on camels, and travels to the city of departure. At this point he usually sells his camels to buy rested ones. All of the merchants interested in trading at a target city gather, and they select a caravan guide. This is a complex process, because the success of the caravan is almost entirely dependent on this man’s skill. The guide chooses a day of departure, which must be during the colder part of the year (October to''
''March). The guide’s men check that all of the camels are properly loaded. The merchant does not travel the desert himself: he places his goods in the care of a trusted slave, or a younger relative. When the caravan leaves, it may have two thousand camels. It is better, its is thought, for everyone who wishes to trade to a particular city in that year to travel as a single unit. The caravan averages one stage (21 miles) per day, traveling only at night and in the morning, following a circuitous route to avoid hazards identiﬁed by the caravan guide. Most routes end with water each day. This is precautionary. Camels only need to be watered every ten days, so faster travel, using more direct routes, is possible. This is avoided because there is the chance that when a caravan reaches a particular well, it will be dry, surrounded by bandits, poi''
''soned, hidden by sand, or not where the guide remembers it. A caravan guide should have many Abilities. His Area Lore permits him to follow paths through the desert, even when the terrain is changed by sandstorms. His Language skills allow him to negotiate with the desert tribes. His Leadership keeps his staff of scouts and laborers at their duties when trouble strikes. He can navigate by the stars, which is important, because caravans carry limited supplies and water, to maximize cargo space. Many guides are skilled in dealing with creatures of the various Realms. The caravan guide is paid either in money or in shares of cargo. When a caravan is estimated to be four days from its destination, a runner is dispatched to warn the Sudanese that it is approaching. Runners are always sent, at minimum, in pairs, because the demons''
''of the desert love to play with single runners, so that they go mad, die of thirst, or both. Runners are paid enormous sums: pounds of gold for a few days work. The Sudanese send agents into the desert, to deal with foreigners at oases, rather than allowing them to leave the desert. When a caravan arrives at a Maghrebi city, if it is returning as a unit, everyone rapidly learns its departure date. Between the instant the caravan arrives and the moment it leaves, everyone who wants to sell must sell, everyone who wants to buy must buy, and every merchant needs to sell his current set of camels and purchase new ones. Some cities receive but a single caravan a year, or every ten years, so the pressure on all parties is intense. Crime against and by merchants, who leave when the caravan leaves, is lucrative.''
''WESTERN ROUTE: IWALATAN ROAD''
''The Iwalatan Road often begins in Marrakesh and continues on to the great trading center of Sijilmasa, situated just north of the desert. It then turns south, through the pass guarded by the fortress of Tamdoult and across the Tanezrouft to the fading city of Aoudaghost. In Aoudaghost, the path turns to Iwalatan. Caravans using this route often return with gold more than other commodities.''
''CENTRAL ROUTES: TAGHAZA TRAIL''
''The Taghaza Trail departs from Sijilmasa, traveling twenty-ﬁve days south to Taghaza, then another ten days to the well at Tasarahla, and ﬁnally another ﬁfteen days south to Iwalatan. Some caravans decide to go more south-southeast at Tasarahla, and continue on. Caravans on this route take gold and slaves north, returning with manufactured goods and salt. The largest expeditions consist of thousands of camels, and depart at the beginning of the cool season in November, with a smaller caravan departing in March. Other smaller and more foolhardy caravans make the trip at all times of the year. Once northbound caravans arrive in Sijilmasa, they disperse among Fez, Tahert, Tangier, Tlemcen, and Tunis to sell their wares and prepare for the return trip.''

==Story Seeds==

''This trade provides many opportunities for stories.''
''MEN OF WAR''
''Soumaoro Kanté is the rumored Sorcerer-King of Sosso beyond the trade routes. The Caliph of Kanem, he is a shadowy ﬁgure feared by both the Berbers and Tuareg, who dare do no more than whisper his name, for it is said he can hear it spoken on the desert winds. However, if he exists, the Sorcerer-King seems to possess an insatiable demand for slaves to ﬁght his wars, wars he supposedly prosecutes against his rivals and the jinn of the deep desert. Some claim he can use the salt and gold traded from his empire as an Arcane Connection, and perceive through the eyes and ears of the slaves he has sent into Mythic Europe, but all this cannot be true, can it?''
''LOST...''
''Moorish pirates have captured members of the covenant while they travelled on business. Arcane Connections possessed by the magi indicate that they’re bound for the Maghreb, but something seems to be masking the exact location of the prisoners. In order to''
''recover their covenfolk before they’re sold as slaves and sent across the sands, they’ll need to search the markets along the coast. Any missteps and they may have to plunge into the desert in pursuit of their friends. And just what is concealing the prisoner’s whereabouts?''
''...AND FOUND''
''A group of grogs arrives to pledge their service to the magi, stating they have traveled from the south and seek employment. Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie shows them to be honest, and the men are all pagan, meaning they require no mosque or church within the covenant grounds. Their martial skills are superior and they appear to be well-trained and disciplined. However, when members of the group are taken into civilization on errands or as escorts, they hide or abandon the group at inopportune moments. Eventually, it becomes known that this new turb was originally the slave-soldier cadre of a local leader, and killed a number of guards in their escape. How will the magi deal with the situation when the former owner demands the return of his property, and brings the matter before a local magistrate?''
''CENTRAL ROUTES: GHADAMES ROAD''
''The Ghadames Road has two forks, both originating in Ifriqiya. The ﬁrst departs from Tunis and the second from Tripoli. Both then proceed to Wargala before continuing to Ghadames, where caravans might choose either southeast to Takedda in the Ténéré or southwest into the Tanezrouft. Slaves, salt, and gold are all common on the northbound Ghadames Road and manufactured goods and slaves most often go south. This path remains west of most of the Ahaggar mountains, but is a long and dangerous path.''
''CENTRAL ROUTES: GARAMANTIAN ROAD''
''The Garamantian Road, named after the former rulers of the land it passes''
''through, begins in Siwa, at the edge of Egyptian lands, before crossing the Libyan Sand Sea to Zaouila, continuing to Ghat and turning south to end in Tadekka. Many caravans traveling this road in the northbound direction continue past Siwa, and end in the souks of Cairo and Alexandria. Similar to the Ghadames Road, this is also quite dangerous, but remains mostly east of the Ahaggar mountains.''
''SOUTHERN ROUTE: BILMA TRAIL''
''The Bilma Trail often begins in Cyrene or Cairo before plunging through the Great Sand Sea to arrive in Murzuq. From there, it turns south to snake between the Ahaggar and Tibesti Mountains, making for the Kaouar oases and Bilma. To reach Bilma, caravans pass over the great sand dunes of the Bilma Erg and the Ténéré, where''
''rock salt is mined in great quantities for trade. This is the shortest of the routes, and the preferred commodities remain slaves, salt, and ivory from the south in exchange for horses, weapons, and manufactured goods from the north. In Bilma, the trade route turns east, into the Nubian Desert, or west, into the Western Desert. Those seeking gold or more exotic goods must head to Takedda, as there is little gold for trade in Bilma. The trip from Bilma to Takedda is roughly 21 days, and it is the same amount of time from Bilma to Murzuq.''
''CAMELS''
''Camels in North Africa come in two breeds, pack camels and saddle camels. Pack camels are larger, slower and can carry more. They are used for trade, and are by far the most common breed. Saddle camels are swifter and nimbler, and are combat mounts. Camels are seen as an intermediate choice: faster than oxen and able to carry more than horses. Most camel caravans travel between 15 and 25 miles per day, but this snakes past obstacles, and tacks between water sources, so that arriving at a destination takes far longer than this speed suggests. Camels can be ridden either saddled, like a horse, or sitting in a small, enclosed canopy. The latter method is preferred by wealthy people and pilgrims. Many canopies allow two riders. This allows the riders to pass time in discussion, playing chess, or eating. A canopy''

==Story Seed: The Archetypical Road==

''The trade across the desert presents a completely archetypical Faerie opportunity to steal the vitality of those crossing, as it is essentially a road story. The entire experience — the guides, the fearsome beasts, the bandits — all align with the fact these elements continue to survive despite the harsh conditions. So do the fay delight in the suffering of the slaves, or the misery of the travelers, or the greed of the merchants? Perhaps it is some combination of the three!''

==Tales and Travelogues==

''Characters hoping to research potential routes and hazards before venturing into the sands may seek out texts written by one of many Muslim scholars. Some of the more common titles include:''
''Book of Routes and Places (Classical Arabic) Summa Area Lore: Maghreb (Level 3, Quality 10), Tractatus Area Lore: Great Desert (Quality 10) Author: Abu Abdullah al-Bakri Availability: The private libraries of merchants and nobles in Maghreb and Al-Andalus. Description: Written in 1068 and drawn from the literature and reports of traveling merchants over two centuries, this book discusses distant empires across the Great Desert, the Almoravid dynasty, and the trade caravan routes.''
''Kitab Sūrat al-’Ard, “Face of the Earth” (Classical Arabic) Summa Area Lore: Maghreb (Level 5, Quality 11), Tractatus Area Lore: Provence (Quality 11), Tractatus Area Lore: Iberia (Quality 11), Tractatus Area Lore: Sicily (Quality 11)''
''Author: Moḥammad Abū’l-Qāsim Ibn Hawqal Availability: The private libraries of merchants and nobles in Maghreb and Al-Andalus. Description: This book, a revision and extension of earlier texts, included detailed descriptions of Muslim-held Spain, Italy and particularly Sicily. It mentions the area of Fraxinet in Provence as richly cultivated by its Muslim inhabitants, making some Hermetic scholars suggest that Ibn Hawqal was a follower of Jerbiton.''

''also provides protection from the sun and from wind-blown sand, without the need for extra layers of clothing. The Ride Ability allows those familiar with horses to ride camels. Many warriors prefer to ﬁght from horseback, and will ride their camel to a battle then swap over, much as a European knight might ride to a tournament on a courser and then switch to his charger. See the Bestiary Appendix for camel statistics.''

==The Mystery of the Sudan==

''The Sudanese do not want foreigners in their cities, beyond the trade camps at the edges of the desert. They certainly do not want them traveling further south than the Sahel — the fertile southern shore of the desert — and in some places prefer to trade with them at oases in the''
''desert. Why this is so is unclear. The story the Sudanese give is that they do not want foreigners to know where their gold comes from. This story sounds superﬁcially convincing but, on reﬂection, it is not clear what harm telling merchants where the gold comes from could do. There are, apparently, no other routes to the gold, so they could not be cut out by another, more direct route. The Sudan has been invaded from the Tell once before, but it is difﬁcult to see how it could be repeated now that a large community of merchants can warn the Sudanese, allowing them to guard waypoints, poison wells, and set ambushes. Arabic thinkers suggest there’s something about Sudanese culture that the locals don’t want merchants to know. The most extreme theory is that the Sudanese are not human at all, but are faeries, but other theories are also passed around dinner parties in the Tell. These include:''
''• The Sudanese lifestyle is somehow''
''so repellent that the Arabs would cease to trade with the Sudanese if they discovered it. It’s widely believed that the further one lives from the Mediterranean, in either direction, the more disgusting one’s morals become. • The Sudanese are the servant caste of another culture, which does not wish to interact with the servants of Allah — evil jinn, for example. • The gold is made in a corrupt or demeaning way. For example, if the gold is the excrement of monsters, then it will be difﬁcult to get Arabs to carry around bagfuls of it to pay for things. • The Great Desert really is the edge of the world. The Sudan is in Faerie, and the faeries want the people praying ﬁve times a day to stay out of it. • The Sudanese don’t care about gold. Gold, to the Sudanese, is like sand. They have been getting all the goods they want for the equivalent of sand for centuries, and they don’t want''

==Axudad, the Deathstalker Scorpion of Virtue==

''It scrambled over the dune, slate gray and strangely unfamiliar. Its spider-like eyes stared at me with a ﬂat, inscrutable expression as its pincers ﬂexed menacingly; it was a sight made more fearsome given the creature was roughly as big as a six-year old child. The tail arched over its body with a wicked stinger glistening with potent venom.''

''people to stop bringing them useful stuff, essentially for free. • The faeries that rule the Sudanese want the journey, not the gold. All of the trade goods that have ever been bought to the Sudan are sitting in a big pile just outside Kombuh Saleh.''

==Trade Goods Carried Across the Great Desert==

''Wheeled vehicles are not used to cross the desert, because roads cannot be kept clear of sand. This makes travel slower, more arduous, and reduces the amount of cargo each beast can carry. This in turn makes bulk trade across the Great Desert uncommon. Textiles, glassware, ceramics, paper, armaments, and horses are carried south to the desert communities. Gold and slaves are sent to the Mediterranean, along with cotton cloth, cattle hides, goatskins, and leatherwork, as lesser cargoes ﬁlling spaces in loads. Salt and copper are found in the desert itself, and travel south, purchased on the way by merchants traversing the Great Desert with other goods.''
''HUMAN SLAVES''
''If Sudanese slavers, in your saga, are similar to those in the real world, then the majority of slaves exported to the cities of the Tell are women, who become domestic servants, and in some cases concubines. Islamic law requires that if a concubine gives birth to the child of a Muslim, the father must acknowledge the baby as his, and free its mother. Many males slaves work in agriculture or other industry, but a proportion of them are soldiers, and these tend to die in battle or be granted their freedom after great victories. Some Muslims also free their slaves in their wills. These routes out of slavery keep demand for replacements, and prices, high. A swift breed of horse, the Barbary steed, has been bred in North Africa. These are prized throughout the world. The impetus for the development of these animals was as a tool for slavers to round up people in the far south, where horses are unknown, or small. The price of a Barbary steed is usually quoted in slaves: each costs between ten and thirty people.''

==Axudad, the Deathstalker Scorpion of Virtue (Cont’d)==

''rock or small sand dune. MuIm 10 (Base 5, +1 Conc): Personal Power (10 levels, -1 Might cost, +10xp Concentration) Encumbrance: 0 (0) Vis: There are two pawns of Mentem in the creature’s stinger. Appearance: A dull black creature with chitinous, crab-like legs, glossy obsidian eyes, over-sized pincers and an arched barbed tail hanging over the body.''
''The size of a healthy dog, the Deathstalker Scorpion of Virtue is cruel and belligerent, often hunting for warm creatures asleep near ﬁres or resting on sun-drenched rocks. They enjoy lurking just beneath the sand, soaking in the warmth and lunging forward to sting''
''creatures which step over them. The stinger of a Scorpion of Virtue can be Enriched by setting it on a handle of willow wood, anointing it with sap of the Alkhad gourd and leaving it plunged into a sand dune for month. When withdrawn and carried as a token, it provides the bearer with Greater Immunity to Venom. The creeping root of the Alkhad, or Tadjalt, plant and its inedible gourds are claimed to be a cure for scorpion venom by the Tuareg. When cut, the gourd produces a milky-white sap said to purge the body of poisons.''
''STORY SEED: THE BITTER FRUIT''
''A neighboring tribe of Berbers seeks out the magi. Their chieftain’s son has been stung by a Deathstalker Scorpion of Virtue, and dozens of the creatures guard the only nearby source of Alkhad gourds in a hidden wadi. If the characters can acquire the gourds and treat the young man, the tribe may agree to serve for some time as grogs, reveal a local jinn’s hidden external vis, or show the covenant a previously unknown spring. The sheer numbers of the creatures ensure that any plan to simply charge through them is doomed to fail, and their cruel nature means those who try to walk through them under the protection of a ward are likely to ﬁnd the gourds hidden. The characters must ﬁnd someway to deceive the deceivers.''

==The Silent Trade==

''Those who barter for gold guard the sources of their wealth jealously. Locals claim that two plants have roots of pure gold, but most believe these to be stories to fool the gullible. In those places where traders exchange goods for gold dust and nuggets, a curious tradition has evolved. The northern caravan masters leave their manufactured wares atop a large designated stone or platform. Then, they retreat out of sight. The gold traders then emerge and leave an amount of gold they feel adequate for the exchange before signaling and returning to observe from hiding. The caravan leaders return, and either take the gold or signal the traders again, indicating the sum is too little. This back and forth continues until the caravan takes their gold or their goods and departs. But who are these traders? Are they faeries who gain vitality from the exchange? Are they demons who breed the sin of greed amongst the caravan membership? Are they primitive tribesmen without language, or the emissaries of a lost kingdom, like Atlantis, Prester John, or the storied Sorcerer-King of Sosso?''

==Demon of Thirst and Despair==

''The statistics for this demon use the rules given in Realms of Power: Infernal.''
''Order: Accusers (variant) Infernal Might: 10 (Aquam) Characteristics: Int +1, Per +1, Pre 0, Com +1, Str +2, Sta +2, Dex +2, Qik +1 Size: 1 Virtues and Flaws: Weak-willed Personality Traits: Doubt +3 Combat: Trample: Init +8, Attack +16*, Defense +14*, Damage +13 *Includes Ability specialization Soak: +7 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–6), –3 (7–12), –5 (13–18), Incapacitated (19–24), Dead (25+) Abilities: Brawl 6 (trample) Powers: Coagulation, 1 point, Init –1, Terram: Allows the demon to create a material form for itself. This form varies slightly, but most such creatures prefer a wave of grinding stones, using the Envisioning power to communicate with victims. Taking material form requires one round, although the demon may discorporate almost instantly. The demon may use its rocky body to hide trails and landmarks.''
''Elemental Control of Water, variable points, Init +1, Aquam: The demon may use any Creo, Muto, or Rego Aquam effect, at the cost of 1 Might per Magnitude. The demon is limited to minor effects, with level equal to its Might or less. It uses this power to taunt those dying of thirst. Envisioning, 1 point, Init +0, Mentem: The demon may make subtle changes to a victim’s dreams, to make them more ominous and depressing. Obsession, 3 points, Init –5, Vim: When a human performs a venial sin and the demon responds by spending Might, this demon gains an opportunity to force the human to feel spiritual doubt. When next faced with a crisis of worthiness, the Storyguide makes a simple roll +3, to reﬂect the strength of the feelings of doubt, and the player responds with a simple die + and suitable Personality Trait – adjustments for exposure to harsh environment. If the character’s total is higher, the demon has not been able to break the character’s sense of self-worth. If the demon’s total is higher, then the character gains a Doubt score of +1. If the character ever acts on this score, then he is in a state of''
''sin. The demon then coagulates and kills its victim, often by turning its body into a grave which it tempts the character to throw himself in. Those few demons of this type who have humanoid forms prefer to create pools of water and drown their victims. Weakness: Protected Group (Can only prey on solo travelers) Vis: 2 pawns tainted Perdo, body Appearance: Often appears like an elemental made of grinding stones, but can also appear as a moving pillar of salt, or, on rare occasions, a human shape. These creatures are cowardly and do not appear in human form to characters strong enough to ﬁght them. The demon may use the substance of its body to hide tracks and landmarks.''
''These demons dwell in the desert, and mislead travelers. The demons hope that, worn down with physical privation and the psychological strain of imminent death, their victims will lose faith. They then kill the victim, so that penitence is impossible. These demons only ever attack people who are on their own, which is why the runners from caravans always travel in pairs.''
''ers, then these slaves can’t just come from a kingdom further south. Perhaps they come from a kingdom that fell into Faerie. Perhaps they are really from the distant islands near India. Perhaps they are Europeans from before the Flood of Noah. If a group of faeries has been collecting people during natural disasters and storing them, then as supplies dwindle, the origin and skill sets of the slaves may change. For example, the player characters may ﬁnd a thousand slaves for sale, all speaking classical Latin and claiming to be from Pompey.''
''FANTASTIC SLAVES''
''The slaves from south of the desert may, in your saga, not be human at all. They might be faeries, or magical con''
''structs produced in strange factories. The Plinian races may be sold north as slaves. They could be spirits bound to solid forms, or the dead forced to labor for the living.''

==Is The Great Desert Tied To A Realm?==

==A Traditional Way of Killing Ghouls==

''One traditional way of killing a ghoul that is troubling you is to ﬂee to your house. Ghouls almost always taunt you for the ﬁrst few nights, or let you get away with being partially eaten. Some offer to spare you for a night if you put a ﬁnger through the keyhole so they can suck blood from it, or bite it off. The next day, dig a grain storage pit behind your door. When the ghoul returns, taunt the creature to frenzy. Let it bash down the door and rush at you. It then falls into the hole, which you rapidly ﬁll with ﬁrewood. Roast the ghoul, then ﬁll in the hole. Even ghouls do this when they want to kill other ghouls. It is also a folkloristic way of killing lions.''

==Why Do People Remain Slaves?==

''Players used to modern stories about slavery may be tempted to think that the most immediate aspiration of a character who is a slave is to seek freedom. Non-player characters rarely attempt to free themselves by ﬂight. There are several reasons for the seeming passivity of slaves in the region.''
''GOD SENDS FLEEING SLAVES TO HELL''
''The belief that slaves who run from their masters are thieves and will be sent to Hell is held, at this time, by all three of the major religions in this area. Each says that it is wrong to enslave one’s coreligionists, but all three believe there are evil spirits that tempt slaves to ﬂee, in much the same way there are spirits which tempt men to murder, promiscuity, or other sins.''
''PERMEABILITY''
''Many slaves are freed by their masters for various reasons. A slave who bears a child by her master must be freed and supported. Warrior slaves are often freed after campaigns. Many domestic slaves are freed in the wills of their employers, or as acts of charity. This means''
''its possible to be a slave for a certain period of time, and then be free, without taking the risk of running away.''
''LACK OF OTHER OPTIONS''
''A slave who ﬂees in the Maghreb may not know where to go to ﬁnd new work, and so ﬂight and starvation are synonymous. Slaves in the 19th century American context were ﬂeeing to a country desperately short of cheap labor; slaves in Mythic Arabia are ﬂeeing to other places where all the menial, and much of the skilled, labor is performed by slaves. Some slaves believe it is better to be a ghilman, a trusted slave given responsibility for his master’s business, than to be free but poor.''
''FATALISM''
''Maghrebi Muslims do not hold to the (entirely modern) belief that if one works hard, one’s life should improve. Rather they believe much of a person’s life, including much of the suffering, is the will of God and thus inevitable. Some people have fortune, some don’t. Flight can’t relieve suffering, because suffering is inevitably constant.''

==Symbols of The Two Forces==

''The two forces have had various names. The Egyptians called the realm of the creative force the Black Land, and the realm of the destructive force the Red Land. Some spirits in the service of each side proclaim their loyalties with these colors. This detail, which has entered folklore, is copied by faeries. Many little details in faerie stories repeat the opposition of black and red: rival armies of ants, the chess pieces, and the clothes of feuding warlords each divide into black and red. Other symbols for each side include Red Black Desert River Mountain Oasis Sand Soil Chaos Order Foreigners Africans Fire Water The Set-beast The Horus-beast''

''ideas and use each as it suits the stories they wish to tell.''

==Magical Interpretation: Two Great Spirits==

''Africa is the battleground between two great Magical spirits. These beings are so vast that magic is unable to affect them, and they cannot directly communicate with humans in any useful way. Each generates representatives and tools which it uses in the struggle against its opposite. These great spirits and their''
''servants may interact with magi. Some servants may become familiars, drawing their magi into the war.''
''THE HUNGER, AND THE CREATURES OF THE RED''
''The destructive force at the heart of the desert has many names, but the few scholars who discuss it directly call it The Hunger. The Hunger endlessly seeks to consume the lands at the edge of the Great Desert. Its creatures poison wells and ﬁll oases. The Creatures of the Red are often assisted by faeries who destroy crops and burn towns, which has''
''the useful side effect of preventing humans from irrigating land. Many more people know about the faeries that attack settlements than the spirits that command and support them. The Red has many ambassadors. Its most powerful children are the spirits of place it creates as it consumes all life in each particular locale. It is, in addition, served by a race of spirits that look like men, but when seen with Second Sight, have the heads of fennec foxes. These tend an apparently limitless horde of Set-beasts. The Egyptians believed this force was strongest in the Hoggar Mountains, but that may just be where a powerful faerie tied to this''

''force claimed to be from. Some spirits may serve the Red more by accident than design. Aisha Qandisha, for example, is a famous jinn from Morocco. She is widely known as a seducer of men who walks the dry beds of rivers. She beneﬁts from the sterility bought by the Hunger, and in turn causes men to lose their vigor. If the Red becomes more powerful, oases in the desert shrink, and the Plateau becomes less fertile. When this has happened in the past, tribes from the desert have pushed into the fertile land of the Tell. With the Almohads so weak, there would be little to prevent them conquering much of the coastal territory. The last time this happened, and the Beni Hallali invaded from Persia, they deliberately destroyed irrigation systems throughout the east of the region.''
''THE HOPE, AND THE CREATURES OF THE BLACK''
''The great destructive force in Africa is opposed by the great elemental spirit of the Nile. Player characters on the northwestern African coast are nowhere near the main area of conﬂict: they are deep within the Land of the Red and many local magical traditions favor the Red. The cities of the coast have survived because of the Dominion, which effectively favors the Black by protecting humans, who then reclaim and plant croplands. In pagan times, the coastal cities were protected by powerful faeries, whose activities favored the Black. The Hope still has powerful lieutenants, but most of these are in Egypt. One, who was encountered by the Romans, called herself Africa, and she remains active in the area around Tunis. She has the form of a gigantic, ghostly woman, and has the power to utter prophecies which are fated to come true. Whether this power works on the Faithful is unclear. Elsewhere in North Africa, the Hope is represented by the geniuses of great natural features, by spirits of rain, and by the enigmatic horus-beasts. Some of the crafter traditions draw on the power of the Black to call forth rain. Some say that a sect of sorcerer Blemmyes, who once tended the Temple at Philae, serve the Black. If this is''
''true, they also presumably look human except to Second Sight. If the Hope suddenly becomes more powerful, rainfall in North Africa increases. The desert becomes easier to cross and many more slaves are needed for farming. Cities with strange cultures rise in new oases, and forgotten faeries are remembered when people reinhabit ruins. Nomadic people switch to agriculture, which makes the kingdom richer and the population larger, making the Iberian Reconquista more difﬁcult. The Red and Black have powerful spirits as lieutenants, and player characters who seek them out may be Initiated into Mysteries that draw on the power of each side to harm the other. Red Initiations, like desiccation, are found in the following chapter of this book.''

==Faerie Interpretation: The Land of Ghouls==

''In this interpretation, the edges of the Great Desert are guarded by spirits, who claim there is a vast kingdom of ghouls hidden within the miles of gravel and sand. Ghouls are generally evil, and crave the taste of human ﬂesh. Occasionally they can be kind. There are recorded examples of girls rescued from ghoulish husbands sneaking away to return to the Kingdom of the Ghouls. There is a woman who lives there, to this day, with seven ghoulish brothers. She ﬂed marriage with a sultan to return to her monstrous husband. In Ars Magica, two versions of ghouls have been presented. Realms of Power: Faerie describes a cannibal spirit, while The Cradle and the Crescent describes a tribe of spirits who have, for the most part, fallen into the service of Iblis. Either might work in this Kingdom of the Ghouls, because, in a West African context, “ghoul” refers to a wide variety of faerie creatures. Folktales include ghoulish knights, giants, and animals. Storyguides are encouraged to rework existing faeries to create ghoul variants. Folklore calls the Land of the Ghouls a kingdom, but the king never appears. He, or she, might be an ancient ghoul of great power and experience. The ruler of the ghouls might, however, be any powerful''
''being, from an angel to a demon, from a mortal man skilled in telling tales to the ghost of a Criamon Primus. There may be no king, or the role of king may be taken by whatever spirit is nearby when a story is unfolding. The treasury of the ghouls is a cave that opens, if asked to in the name of a mysterious person. Characters stealthy enough to avoid the ghouls, remembering their extra-ordinary sense of smell, may hide and overhear the name when guards command the vault to open. This name may be an Arcane Connection to the Ghoul King, or to the creator of his vaults.''

==Infernal Interpretation: The Punishment of God==

''In the beginning the world was a paradise, a garden, and all men lived off its plenty. Then Man invented deceit. When the ﬁrst lie was told, God was deeply affronted, and forbade lying. He said to the men “You must not lie; every time you do I will punish you by throwing a grain of sand from the sky onto the Earth.” And men, who were foolish, said “What harm could that do? You can barely see a grain of sand!” The Great Desert, in this interpretation, has an Infernal aura of 2, but it is higher where people have hidden in the desert to commit crimes. Demons dance across the boiling sands of the desert, which is, in parts, almost like the Fiery Pit. Entrances to Hell are found in the mountains, and Infernal craftsmen make weapons for the war at the end of time at the Hoggar Mountains.''

==High Fantasy Interpretation: The Crack Between the Worlds==

''The caravans that come out of the desert, in this version of Mythic Europe, do not come from a far-southern kingdom, but from other worlds, through portals deep within the desert itself.''
''THE CARAVANS ARE FAERIE MARKETS''
''In this variant, when a caravan arrives, ﬁlled with wealth and potential for social change, it is always a troupe of faeries. These creatures carry real goods, which they have exhausted, and trade them for vital things, or for a role in the stories of mortals drawn to their wares.''
''THE CARAVANS COME FROM WOUNDED WORLDS''
''In this variant, the Hope and the Hunger have been competing not only on this world, but in others. These are either hidden in a realm, or are parallel mundane worlds in other Creations. The conﬂict has damaged the worlds, but trade allows the people there to continue to survive. For example, the slavers with the gold from the heart of the desert might come from a place where the Hunger is dominant. There are many people, ﬁghting over scarce resources, and they are willing to trade gold, which they cannot eat, and conquered peoples, who they do not wish to feed, for the resources of this world. Alternatively, perhaps the benign face of the Black is a disguise. The traders may come from a world so dominated by fecundity that life-giving salt, a desiccant, can no longer be found, so they come to trade it for the worthless gold which breeds beneath the surface of their Earth.''
''THE CARAVANS COME FROM UNKNOWABLE PLACES, FOR UNKNOWABLE REASONS''
''In this variant, the caravans come from deep in the Magical Realm, far beyond where magi normally go. They may be spirits, or the way the Realm is cleaned of material detritus left by travelers. Magi who follow the caravans go into the Twilight Void, and perhaps beyond, but never return to speak of what they have seen.''

==The Sources of the Nile==

''This section presents you with some options when designing your version of Mythic Africa. Each of the following choices provides different plot hooks and saga ideas, suiting different styles of play.''

==Actual Geography: Oasis Stories==

''In the real world, the Nile rises in central Africa, and has little inﬂuence on the region this book considers. South of the Great Desert is a fertile band called the Sahel, which means “shore,” and it is fed in the west by two large rivers, the Senegal and the Niger. This area is called the Bilad-es-Sudan, “Land of the Blacks” by Arabs, but has a mixture of Sudanese, Berber and Arab inhabitants. The kingdoms in this area are small and war-tossed. If your game’s history follows real history for the region, they are struggling through the period between the fall of the Empire of Ghana in 1204, and the foundation, in about 1240, of the Empire of Mali. Troupes should use actual geography if crossing the desert is important to their character concepts or covenant design. Characters skilled in survival and negotiating with the spirits of the desert have their roles diminished if there is a Western Nile. The desert, as a setting, adds a more realistic tone to stories than the high fantasy alternative. At the same time it encapsulates places, making it understandable that a particular site has lain undisturbed for centuries, hidden in the desert.''
''THE BLACK CITY''
''Deep in the desert is the city of a king who is in mourning. His people wear black, and have painted their houses black. The mosque and the wall around the city are likewise black. The king discovered his wife was''
''drugging him each evening and sneaking out to see a lover. The king tricked his wife into swallowing the soporiﬁc intended for him. The king then dressed in her clothes, was welcomed into the house of her lover, and decapitated him. When he presented the lover’s head to his wife the next morning she died of shock. The king lives in mourning until a true woman can be found for him. He questions travelers, and subtly encourages talk about women. Ribaldry does not interest him. If a virtuous woman — particularly with a terrible husband — is mentioned to him, he may send her a gift. The treasure he chooses is a string of white pearls. Any woman who wears the pearls is turned into a dove. It then follows its homing instinct to ﬂy swiftly to his kingdom. When the dove arrives, the king removes the necklace and the woman regains her human form and mind. If the king ever takes a new wife, his people will celebrate by washing the town white.''
''THE SILENT PRINCESS''
''There is a city in the desert which has a palace ringed with 100 stakes. Virtually all of them have the head of a young man impaled upon them. The daughter of the ruler is mute, and her father has sworn no man may wed her unless he makes her speak. Each man who fails is beheaded, and, as her father has said that no more than 100 men may die in this way, it seems likely this lovely girl will never marry. Player characters can shock the girl into speaking by causing her to botch a Personality Trait roll. This may be done most easily through storytelling. Characters who think to ask her servants know that this approach has been tried before, but that love stories are ineffective. Stories in which outrageous things happen, and vices are rewarded, are likely to make her angry, so that she shouts at the player characters.''
''ZERZURA''
''One line of Egyptian Pharaohs was from the southern kingdom of Kush. They lost the throne of Egypt, and the invader continued to push south, so that it become clear to the Kushites that their capital would fall. As they fought a delay''
''ing action along the Nile, the young men and women of Kush were outﬁtted for an expedition. When the invaders took the capital, they were told that the young people had left for a refuge: a secret oasis far to the west, called Zerzura. The invaders did not chase them; the conditions in the desert were too harsh. Arab writers have claimed to visit Zerzura once. The city is guarded by a tribe of black giants, although their relationship to the city’s inhabitants is unclear. The people here worship a great bird, and a statue of it is found above the gate. The key to the city’s gate is in the statue’s beak. Zerzura was built with obvious Egyptian inﬂuences. All of the people in Zerzura are asleep and unaging. They are ruled by a king and queen, and it is vital for robbers that they not stray near this couple, lest they wake. Provided the thief does not wake the inhabitants, and avoids the guards, he may take all the treasure he can carry. Why the Kushites are sleeping, and what will wake them, is not recorded. No Hermetic magus has yet heard this story, but once it circulates, many Seekers will wish to ﬁnd this outpost of Pharaonic civilization.''

==Fantastic Geography: Stories for the Nile of the Blacks==

''Many Medieval Arabic geographers believe that the Nile rises in the Atlas Mountains and heads south across the Great Desert. There it intersects the Nil-es-Sudan, which roughly follows the path of the real-world Senegal, the Niger, and a few other rivers all joined together. The Nile then turns east. It splits in two, creating a vast island. It then rejoins. After it crosses almost all of the Continent, it turns north. At this point it is joined by water from southern Africa, even, according to some geographers from the Mountains of the Moon, which are debatably on the other side of the unlivable region close to the Equator. The Nile then ﬂows through Nubia and Egypt. Troupes should consider this version of the Nile if a high fantasy game appeals, or if''
''they have character concepts or covenant designs which are better suited to a permeable Great Desert. In the standard setting, used throughout the rest of this book, it’s assumed that the Western Nile exists, but has faded from the world as the Red defeats the Black. It is now a regio, far from the mortal world and difﬁcult to reach, but with a high Magic aura. It is ﬁlled with magical spirits sheltering from the mundanities of the world. It is also a batteground between the Red and the Black. If the characters triumph in the cause of the Hope, the regio draws closer to the world. A shattering injury to the Hunger, on the scale of the splitting of the European Forest (described in Guardians of the Forest), might draw the Western Nile back into the mortal world. The seeds below are suitable for a Western Nile either in the mundane world, or in a regio.''
''THE LONG VOYAGE: A SAGA HOOK''
''A covenant could be formed of magi who wish to explore the Nile. Beginning in North Africa, the group seeks out the Nile’s headwaters. They travel for years, through the strange kingdoms beyond the desert, eventually emerging into Egypt, and dissolving their group beneath the Lighthouse of Alexandria.''
''MAKING THE NILE FIT FOR TRANSPORT AND TRADE''
''The Western Nile can, at the troupe’s discretion, be easy to navigate. This makes it the primary conduit for trade and travel through West Africa. Alternatively, the troupe can decide that trade along the Western Nile is currently difﬁcult, and that a focus of the campaign is the covenant’s attempts to make the Nile navigable. The headwaters of the Nile are south of the Atlas Mountains. If the Nile is highly navigable, then a city may have been founded here that controls the passes leading to the rest of the Maghreb. If the Nile is not currently navigable from this point, the player characters may found a city here, and improve its accessibil''
''ity. Passes or tunnels can be cut through mountains. Bridges and roads can be constructed through harsh terrain. Dangerous predators can be destroyed. Bandits and petty noblemen who harass the merchants must be defeated.''
''A CITY IN THE ATLAS''
''A long time ago there was a sweet seller who became so poor he could not even afford the ingredients for his wares. He decided to leave his city, so that if he was forced into beggary, at least it would be among strangers, so his humiliation would be less. He took his ﬁnal possession, a little lamp of tin and red glass, and walked over the Atlas Mountains. The passes of the mountains are confusing, and he lost his way, tracking back and forth for many months. After this time, he found a green valley, and within it a rich city of stone. He approached two men in the market, who knew him for a foreigner, for he spoke Arabic. They were shocked to see him, for no people ever came to their city from outside. The sweet seller was taken to the palace of the Pasha, in which gold was used for common tools, and great piles of gemstones were strewn casually about, as a decoration. The sweet seller was entertained, as is traditional, for three days. At the end of the three days, as is traditional, the sweet seller needed to take his leave, and gift his host a gift. The sweet seller had lived in greater luxury in the past three days than at any other time in his life, and so he was ashamed to be able to offer only his tin lamp. On a moment of inspiration, he offered it as all his world goods. He was surprised, and heartened, to see that the Pasha was mesmerized by his gift. In this city, there was no glass. Windows were slits and cups were of gold. The sight of the candle through the sides of the lantern was fascinating. The Pasha, by inclination and tradition, was required to give a gift of similar value, and had nothing, by his estimation, to offer. With apologies, he had twelve camels loaded with treasure, and was gratiﬁed when the sweet seller seemed pleased to take such triﬂes in exchange for his treasure. The sweet seller headed home, and retired from business. He''
''built a mansion, planted an orchard, and took a beautiful wife, and his family resides in the city still. Now, the tale goes on to say the sweet seller had a wicked brother, and that the brother sold all he had to buy goods to trade in the distant city. He was accosted by bandits who had ignored the poor sweet seller, as he had nothing worth stealing. Perhaps the wicked brother died there. Perhaps he made it to the city, and also had a glass object to offer to the fair-minded Pasha who, with great reluctance, gave his greatest treasure to his new visitor. The wicked brother returned home with nothing but a little lantern of tin and red glass. A similar tale is told in many parts of the Near East, so perhaps these are merely faeries, playing a game of wealth and poverty. Perhaps though there really is a secluded valley in the Atlas, where simple tools are made of gold and gemstones are treated as shiny trinkets, but there is only one piece of glass, and it is valued more than all the rest.''
''THE WESTERN NILE AS A TRADE ROUTE''
''The Nile in Egypt is a useful commercial route up until about Aswan, due to the cataracts (waterfalls), which ships cannot pass. As long as there is sufﬁcient population to justify the expense, cargoes and small boats are portaged around the waterfalls. If the Nile in the West has similar hazards to navigation, they can be magically removed, or other methods of mitigating them developed. Portaging stations and canal systems are used in other areas of Mythic Earth, but player characters may opt for unnatural solutions, such as magical cranes to lift ships, portions of the river that ﬂow through midair to jump over an obstacle, or tame elementals that carry ships safely up and over the rocks. Characters who change the Nile to make it navigable are able to exploit many opportunities to trade. Bulk trade in millet and sorghum is the most voluminous, and perhaps the most lucrative, but goods of middle price require less initial investment. These include leatherwork, cotton cloth, tropical hardwoods like ebony, indigo dye, gum arabic, bronzeware, and brassware. The gold trade is likely to''
''divert to the river. If the characters dominate trade in the Western Nile, do they permit slaves to be ferried up “their” river?''
''FANTASTIC CIVILIZATIONS''
''The Garamatian civilization, described earlier, collapsed in the real world because the subterranean aquifers on which it depended dried up. If there is a Western Nile, then there’s no reason for this civilization to fall, provided its capital is in the fertile land which accompanies the river. The Garamates incessantly raided their neighbors and robbed merchants. The great export from their kingdom was “carbuncles” or carnelian, the Virtuous Form of which allows the holder to see in the dark. Bands of modern Garamates, whose battle chariots sweep out of the moonlit desert to carry away slaves, make useful antagonists. In this case, the ruins discussed in the Fezzan may simply be a lost colony. The Kingdom of Prester John, in 1220, was believed to be in India; after contact with the Mongols, it became clear that it was not in the Near East. Europe’s folklore changed and the Land of Prester John was often thought of as Ethiopia, or a neighboring state. Troupes who want to use the legend of Prester John, and the plot hooks provided for it in The Cradle and the Crescent, but who prefer to retain historical Mongols, can place his kingdom along the banks of the Western Nile. Arabic geographers insist there is a kingdom on the Western Nile where a perfect aphrodisiac grows. A single dose allows a man to have sex as often as he wishes for the rest of the day. According to local law, any of these plants harvested belong personally to the king, who has two hundred wives. The king refuses to sell any of these roots into Muslim lands, as Allah permits men to have only four wives, and he does not wish to anger the deity by tempting men to sin. Many older rulers have asked for the plant and been refused, or have been offered herbs to treat impotence instead. The player characters may be asked to steal the herb, but what if it contains Creo vis? How do they stop their grogs using it and neglecting their duties? As a curio, this country is also home to land tortoises so large a man can stand up''
''right in their tunnels, and when harvested for eating they must be pulled from the tunnels with teams of oxen. Another kingdom in the Western Nile has a strange ritual for selecting kings. Notable men of each area form a semicircle around the mouth of a cave, which is decked in treasures and bright cloths. A dragon with the body of a serpent, the head of a camel, and the mane of a lion crawls forth, and after surveying the men, pokes one on the chin with its nose, then turns back to slither into its home. The selected king must swiftly run up to the creature and pull a handful of hairs out if its mane or tail. The number of hairs accurately predicts how many years the king will rule. This is represented by the Death Prophecy Virtue, although some few kings do not actually die at the conclusion of their reigns. A player character with the right magic items could pin the dragon down and shave it bare. Do the locals accept this king? Can the dragon retaliate?''
