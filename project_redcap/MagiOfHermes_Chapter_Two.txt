''Concept: This seventh son of a seventh son is deeply concerned with his family, and develops many spell effects concerned with health, fertility, and care for children as a result.''
''This is the story of Aurulentus of Jerbiton, an unusual magus as he comes from a family of mages. Aurulentus is a seventh son, an auspicious fate. But not only that, his father was also a seventh son, as was his grandfather. In fact, Aurulentus is the fifth continuous generation of seventh sons. A prophecy was once made to his ancestors that the seventh son in the seventh generation would become a powerful magus and be able to reshape magic. Ever since, the family has used numerous means to ensure that in every generation seven sons are born and raised with the prophecy in mind. It is a story of many generations of hope and struggle, differing views and planning. Aurulentus can expect to witness the heralded powerful magus: his grandson would be the sought-after seventh son in the seventh generation. Over the course of his life, Aurulentus specializes in Corpus magic and uses his special affinity with fertility to accomplish a noteworthy feat: he develops a Longevity Ritual that does not render him infertile and tries to extend this feat to other people’s Longevity Rituals.''

''''
''Aurulentus and his Ancestors''
''Aurulentus’ great-great-great-grandfather, Askanius, visited Greece where he met and fell in love with a nymph of Artemis. She bore him his seventh son (named Alexander) and an ageing priest of the goddess revealed to him that every seventh son of his family would hold a measure of Artemis herself in his blood. Furthermore, once seven continuous generations of seventh sons were born, this seventh son in the seventh generation would be able to reshape magic. Alexander started a mission to ensure that in every generation at least seven sons were born. Aurulentus is in the fifth generation. Not surprisingly, his corporeal father took him as his apprentice early in his childhood. At the age of 13, he was told of the full extent of the prophecy and the differing views his ancestors had on how to father seven sons — something that is now also expected of him. Around the age of 18, Aurulentus found the only comfort of''

''his youth: Semira, the daughter of a Latin instructor. Because of this love, Aurulentus revised his understanding of the prophecy: the only woman whom he wanted to have children with was Semira. In order to have seven sons with one and the same woman, it was necessary to guarantee the health and fertility of both man and woman for a sufficiently long time, prompting his research into Creo and Corpus magics. During his career, Aurulentus invents numerous spells concerned with childbirth and healing, as well as creating a number of items and spells designed to facilitate the daily life of a mother of many children. His most impressive feat, however, will be the invention of a Longevity Ritual that preserves his fertility.''

''controlled aging process of the spell Bane of the Decrepit Body (three separate inventions were needed), investigating the reasons for the infertile Longevity Rituals using the spell The Maculate Noblewoman (four different inventions were needed to perfect the spell), inspecting the Hermetic treatment of Aging Crises using the spell Widening the River Styx (again needing three starts), three times probing the fertility concepts of his own spell Artemis’ Fertility, and finally experimenting with numerous Longevity Rituals of fourth magnitude. Unsuccessful research directions were the analysis of a woman’s fertility using the spells Pose Clotho’s Question and Pose Nona’s Question. Also not promising was his idea of watching an actual act of conception using the spell Verifying the Presence of Artemis’ Blessing. Six seasons in total were spent on stabilizing his research.''
''New Spells''
''Aurulentus has developed the following new spells.''
''Corpus''

===Widening the River Styx===

''CrCo 20, Ritual R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Resolves a minor crisis caused by aging (see ArM5, page 170). The target still requires rest for the remainder of the season to recover fully. Aurulentus successfully used this spell to probe the exact effects Hermetic magic can have during an Aging Crisis for his research. (Base 15, +1 Touch)''

===Blissful Sensations===

''CrCo 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The spell removes all pain not exceeding the pain of a light wound from the target. As soon as the spell duration ends, the pain will return if the source still exists. Aurulentus uses this spell to ease the pains of his wife. His version is specifically designed for his wife, such that she does not gain Warping from this spell (see ArM5, page 168). Frequent use of this spell often leads to an addiction, as the return of all the minor pains a human tends to ignore after the effect expires is overwhelming. The spell is not powerful enough to remove the pains of childbirth, Aurulentus uses the spell Ease the Suffering of Childbirth for this measure. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Artemis’ Fertility===

''CrCo 40 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind Increases the fertility of the target, thus improving the chances of conception. The spell does not guarantee conception, not even during the usual fertile phases of a woman, as Hermetic magic is unable to create life. All other magi Aurulentus has talked to do not believe that this spell works, but this does not deter him. (Base 20 (heal any debilitating effects of poison, disease, or injury preventing conception), +1 Touch, +3 Moon)''

===Bestow the Blessing of Apollon===

''CrCo 50 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Room, Ritual All targets within the room gain a +18 bonus to Recovery rolls to recover from injuries or diseases, as long as they have been under the influence of this spell for the whole of the recovery interval. The recovery interval is counted from the time that the spell is cast or from the time the subject enters the room — whichever is later. Any previous time is ignored. This spell was invented by Aurulentus as a proof of concept. It is no longer used, as it is too expensive in terms of vis and causes Warping. Instead, an Enchanted Item has been made with similar effects (see New Items: Bed of Rapid Convalescence). (Base 15, +1 Touch, +4 Year, +2 Room)''

===Incantation of the Warriors Made Whole===

''CrCo 50 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Room, Ritual Heals all damage to all human bodies in the room at the conclusion of the ritual. The targets must have been present in the room for the entire length of the ritual to benefit from the spell. The spell can only heal wounds, not such damage as missing limbs, or diseases and damage from poisons. This improved version of the Incantation of the Body Made Whole was commissioned by a Tremere magus who wanted to save vis while healing a large group of wounded people. To use this during (or better, after) a battle, a tent may be used instead of a room. Using Target: Room rather than Group means that this spell can heal more wounded, if one can get all of them into a single room. (Base 35, +1 Touch, +2 Room)''

===Blessing of Artemis’ Fertility===

''CrCo 65 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Boundary, Ritual Increases the fertility of all within the boundary, even if they were not present at the completion of the ritual. As with the spell Artemis’ Fertility, no other magus believes that this spell works as anything other than a giant waste of precious Creo and Corpus vis. Aurulentus points out that at his Covenant a higher than average rate of births is apparent, but most magi believe this to be merely a fluke. Other magi theorise that the''
''mundanes are influenced by the fact that the magi have many children, and thus also act in a promiscuous way. So far, no-one has been able to replicate the spell, although Aurulentus gives copies of the Lab Texts of the spell freely to anyone asking for them. (Base 20, +1 Touch, +4 Year, +4 Boundary)''

===Pose Clotho‘s Question===

''InCo 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Determines if the target is pregnant. The spell will fail if cast on a man. Clotho is the youngest of the three Fates. (Base 4, +1 Touch)''

===Parental Inquisitiveness===

''InCo 10 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part Determines the sex of an unborn child. Hermetic magic can only distinguish the unborn child as a Part of the mother from the second trimester of pregnancy onwards (see Ancient Magic, page 55), so this spell will fail if cast in the first trimester of pregnancy. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Part)''

===Pose Nona’s Question===

''InCo 10 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind''
''Determines if the target is pregnant and how many months are left until birth, barring unforeseen circumstances. The spell will fail if cast on a man. If the target is not pregnant, the exact date of the menstrual cycle will be revealed. Nona is the Roman version of Clotho and goddess of pregnancy. She was often called upon by women in their ninth month of pregnancy to ensure a smooth birth. (Base 5, +1 Touch)''

===The Maculate Noblewoman===

''InCo 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Accurately determines the underlying reason for the infertility of the target. Aurulentus successfully used this spell to compare two groups: those infertile from natural causes and those rendered infertile by a Longevity Ritual. Exploring the fundamen''

''The Family Tree''
''Below is a short list of Aurulentus’ ancestors, each generation using a different approach to sire seven sons. Generation 1: Alexander. Alexander believes that in order to fulfill the prophesy, he may not use any magical “tricks” — Artemis is the patroness of women and children. He uses his natural charm to sire seven sons with different mothers. Generation 2: Antipater. He has considerable difficulties fathering seven sons, and dies in bed with a woman just after the conception of his seventh. Generation 3: Alboin. Alboin realizes that charm alone nearly failed his father, and starts to use passive Corpus magic to provide surveillance and protection from diseases. He argues that Artemis couldn’t''
''be against the use of passive magic, as long as the women participate voluntarily. Generation 4: Altus. He no qualms about using Mentem and love magic to manage the, by now large, family and to father his seventh son. Generation 5: Aurulentus. Wishing to sire all of his children with his True Love, Aurulentus believes that developing a Longevity Ritual that does not render the target infertile is the best way to fulfil the prophecy. Generation 6: Arbus Tutus. The seventh son of Aurulentus. So far, he has only managed to sire two daughters and does not seem too keen to father more children ... indeed, he does not seem to be too keen on other women.''
''The Prophecy: A Faerie Game?''
''What happens after (or if) the seventh son in the seventh generation is born? Maybe nothing — the priest of Artemis and the nymph both could have been faeries who started a bet to see if they could fool seven generations of magi.''

''tal differences between these two groups, he was able to gather further insights for his breakthrough. (Base 10, +1 Touch)''

===Verifying the Presence of Artemis’ Blessing===

''InCo 15 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The caster is immediately aware of a conception in the target during the spell duration. Aurulentus observed grogs with and without Longevity Rituals during intercourse with this spell to explore the differences between the two groups. His research was unsuccessful, as he was not able to witness the actual creation of life with this spell. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Ease the Suffering of Childbirth===

''MuCo 15 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part Widens the pelvis of the target, making delivery of the child straightforward. See Art and Academe, page 62, for rules regarding childbirth; this spell gives a +1 bonus to childbirth rolls. Aurulentus invented this spell after realizing that his spell Blissful Sensations had too many undesirable side effects and was not powerful enough to help his wife during childbirth. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)''

===Hold Chur===

''ReCo 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind Holds the target completely motionless for the duration of the spell. In addition, the spell closes the eyes of the target and keeps them firmly shut, so that he is unable to see for the duration of the spell. Chur is a troublesome grog of the covenant. A lesser version of this spell was used to stop him when he was doing mischief. Aurulentus soon realized that a more-powerful version would have many uses: as a combat spell, as a spell to act without witnesses, and as a spell to stop nosy mundanes. It was once used on a friendly grog who came under the influ''
''ence of a mind control spell to stop him from attacking his group without harming him. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 close eyes)''

===House Arrest of the Unruly Child===

''ReCo 30 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle Creates a circle which (if the spell penetrates) no human being may pass. Aurulentus uses this spell to either keep children away from important rooms such as his lab or his bedroom, or to keep children inside a room. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''

===It’s Raining Men===

''ReCo 30 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group Instantly transports the targets five paces upwards into the air, after which they drop to the ground. This breaks up any military formation and inflicts damage as per the rules in ArM5, page 181. This spell was commissioned by a Tytalus magus who commanded a cavalry group and used the spell to break up spearmen lines just before charging into them. The Group target only allows for ten men to be thrust upwards, but this is usually enough to form a small breakthrough that a cavalry charge can exploit. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Group)''

===Seven Leagues Travel===

''ReCo  35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Transports the target to any place within seven leagues either that the caster can see or that the caster has an Arcane Connection to. If the caster fails an Intelligence + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9, the arrival goes slightly awry. This is an improved version of the SevenLeague Stride, sometimes used by Aurulentus to travel with his wife. The spell is specifically designed for Semira, so as to not cause Warping if cast on her. After Aurulentus created Enchanted Items that allow for instant travel, this spell is only seldom used. It was once used to teleport a group into safety from a sinking ship. (Base 30, +1 Touch)''
''Imaginem''

===Comeliness of the Crone===

''MuIm 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The target appears less likeable, cute, and attractive. Numerous subtle changes in appearance bring about this change, including a shriller, higher pitched voice, a more crooked posture, and a slightly more bloated and unclean face and figure. The character gets a –3 modifier on all rolls to influence, seduce, or please others. Aurulentus used this spell on his daughters to test whether their suitors were really more interested in personality than looks as they usually proclaimed. He stopped using it after his wife found out and forbade it. He now uses the Bachelor’s Door (see Enchanted Items) to test suitors of his daughters — without the knowledge of his wife. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Ears of a Grateful Father===

''PeIm 20 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group All voices emitted by a group of individuals will be decreased in volume to that of a normal conversation. Aurulentus invented this spell after he had to babysit ten screaming infants. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group, +1 changing images)''

===Phantasmal Troupe===

''CrIm 15 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind Creates illusionary music from a direction that the caster specifies. A full troupe of musicians can be simulated in this way, with a finesse roll determining the quality of the music. Aurulentus uses this spell to amuse his wife and children. It was originally invented by his parens, Altus, with the same motivation. (Base 1, +2 Voice, +1 Conc, +2 change at command, +1 intricacy)''
''Magi of Hermes Enchanted Items''
''Aurulentus has created the following enchanted items.''
''Army of the Infant''
''This invested item is a collection of wooden army figures: horses, soldiers, generals, and siege weapons. Each has detailed markings and is fully colored. The figures can be moved at command and are capable of emitting the appropriate noises: horses neigh, soldiers yell. This set of toys was created by Aurulentus for his sons; a similar set was made for his daughters, depicting different families of animals with corresponding sounds.''

===Movement of the Toys===

''ReHe 20 Pen +0, unlimited uses/day R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind Enchants the wooden parts of the toys such that they are capable of small, controlled movements. (Base 3, +1 Diam, +2 Group, +10 levels unlimited uses per day)''

===Sounds of the Toys===

''CrIm 20 Pen +0, unlimited uses/day R: Per, D: Diam, T: Ind Creates sounds appropriate for the toy. Full speech is not possible at this level of detail, so the soldiers just shout and yell rather than speak. (Base 1, +1 Diam, +2 Group, +2 at command, +10 levels unlimited uses per day)''
''Bachelor’s Door''
''This invested item is a nondescript door leading to an antechamber where guests can be welcomed and attended to. Aurulentus has all of his daughters await their suitors for the first time behind this door. The thoughts of the entering person will be read to determine if he only wishes to bed any of the  fe''
''males that are present in the room. Should this be the case, a second effect will be triggered that will bar the person from entering the room.''

===Identify the Lecherous Suitor===

''InMe 24 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Reads the emotions of any person passing through the doorway. If strong feelings of lust towards a female in the room are sensed, the second effect, Bar the Lecherous Suitor is triggered. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 level 2 uses/day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''

===Bar the Lecherous Suitor===

''ReCo 33 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind If this effect penetrates, then no human target may pass the doorway into the antechamber. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +5 levels device maintains concentration, +3 levels triggered effect)''
''Bed of Rapid Convalescence''
''CrCo 34 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind A leather sick-bed engraved with Creo and Corpus runes, as well as symbols of Apollon, the Greek god of healing. Anyone resting in this bed receives a +18 bonus to his recovery rolls, as long as he remains in the bed for the whole of the recovery period. Aurulentus created this item as a lesser enchanted device. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 level 2 uses/day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''
''Comb of Aphrodite''
''PeAq 15 Pen +0, unlimited uses/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This comb instantly dries any hair that''
''passes through its teeth. Aurulentus contrived this lesser enchanted device for his wife as a birthday present, after she complained that he should use his magic for more practical purposes. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +10 levels unlimited uses per day)''
''Communication of the Lovers''
''InIm 21 Pen +0, 2/day R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind Two matching silver amulets, each being an Arcane Connection to the other. When activated, this lesser enchanted device allows one to see and hear the person holding the matching amulet. Aurulentus uses these to communicate with his wife when they are separated. Because the device has no Penetration, Aurulentus must suppress his Parma in order to for his wife to be able to see him. The remaining problem, that both sides need to activate the amulets at the same time, was solved by casting a small CrIm spell at R: Arc, to indicate to his wife that he had the time to talk to her. Due to the hazards of leaving Arcane Connections in other persons’ hands and the constant scrying danger, few other magi think such devices are a good idea. (Base 2, +4 Arc, +1 Conc, +5 levels item maintains concentration, +1 level 2 uses/day)''
''Crib with a Mother’s Touch''
''A simple, wooden crib with a crystal centrally fixed along the headpiece. This is an invested item made by Aurulentus to give the mothers of the Covenant a bit more free time.''

===The Sound of Sound Sleep===

''InIm 8 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Listens to the baby in the crib. When the baby starts to scream, the second effect is triggered. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 level 2 uses/day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''

===Rocking Into Sound Sleep===

''ReHe 17 Pen +0, 24 uses/day R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind Once triggered by the first effect, this effect will rock the crib slightly, hopefully resulting in a content and sleepy baby. Once the baby’s crying stops, the crib stops rocking. (Base 3, +1 Conc, +5 levels item maintains concentration, +5 levels 24 uses/day, +3 levels triggered effect)''
''Guardian of Decency''
''A silver necklace with three small beryl stones attached to it. The invested item detects if the wearer is touched by a man and then removes any indecent emotions from him. Aurulentus created this item after he found out that a boy from a neighboring village had aggressively pursued one of his daughters.''

===Who Touches My Daughter?===

''InCo 19 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Detects if the wearer is touched by a man, and then triggers the second effect. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 level 2 uses/day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''

===Dare Not Touch My Daughter!===

''PeMe 30 Pen +0, 3/day R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind Once triggered by the first effect, this effect renders the target completely bereft of lust — he will no longer feel indecent passions towards the wearer of the necklace, or indeed, any woman. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 levels for 3 uses/day, +3 levels triggered effect)''

===a Guardian’s Voice===

''CrIm 11 Pen +0, unlimited uses/day R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind Emits a quiet, but audible humming, so that the effect Dare Not Touch my Daughter! can use the Range: Voice. (Base 1, +10 levels for unlimited uses/day)''
''Nappy without Nuisance''
''PeCo 15 Pen +0, unlimited uses/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind These nappies are lesser enchanted devices embroidered with Perdo runes, making any magus think twice about using them. They destroy any human excreta that are contained within, thus eliminating the need to wash and replace the nappies often. Aurulentus had to promise to be extra careful while preparing this item, and had to conduct extensive tests before his wife allowed him to use them on any of their children. (Base 4 (by analogy to the PeAn 4 guideline “destroy something made of animal products”), +1 Touch, +10 levels unlimited uses)''
''Reunion of Lovers''
''ReCo 40 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Female boots made from finest calf skin, with small, intricately decorated wings on the side. They allow the wearer to duplicate the effects of the spell Seven Leagues Stride up to 24 times per day and were created as an invested device, due to the high level requirement. These items were crafted for Semira, and so do not cause her Warping. (Base 30, +1 Touch, +5 levels for 24 uses/ day)''
''Soothe the Mother’s Anxiety''
''This invested device was created by Aurulentus to calm the many mothers of the Covenant. A number of the devices have been produced over the years. It consists of a small mirror and a separate handle, one being an Arcane Connection to the other. The handle can be put into a room and listens to all noises therein. If a noise louder than a whisper is detected, it triggers the second effect: the mirror displays the image and the noises of the room in which the handle is kept. The mothers are thus able put their babies to sleep and watch them, while still being able to be occupied with other work.''

===The Sound of Sound Sleep===

''InIm 14 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Room Listens to all sounds in the room that are louder than that of a whisper. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Room, +1 level 2 uses/day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''

===What Disturbs Sound Sleep?===

''CrIm 28 Pen +0, unlimited uses/day R: Touch, D: Diameter, T: Ind Displays the images and sounds of the room scryed into by the triggering effect on the mirror. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Diam, +2 move at command, +1 intricacy, +10 levels unlimited uses/day, +3 levels triggered effect)''
''The Face of Paris''
''PeCo 14 Pen +0, unlimited uses/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This razor, although blunt, will remove any and all body hair where it touches the skin of a human. The item has no penetration built into it, so a magus has to suppress his Magic Resistance while shaving. Aurulentus’ wife had always complained that his beard growth was too strong; after a twilight experience his facial hair growth increased manyfold and Aurulentus invented this lesser enchanted device to keep it under control. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +10 levels unlimited uses)''
''Traveller’s Comfort''
''ReAu(Ig) 24 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This sturdy and nondescript travelling cloak protects the wearer from rain and keeps him comfortably warm by keeping bodily warmth inside the cloak. Aurulentus invented the cloak as an invested item after his wife caught a cold from walking in the rain to visit him. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Ig requisite, +1 level 2 uses/day, +3 levels environmental trigger)''
