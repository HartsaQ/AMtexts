''Concept: The apprentice of a marched Infernalist, he is obsessed with darkness and cold as a result of the influence of demons that still surround him, waiting for him to fall.''
''Born a Silesian bond-slave, Tolides of Flambeau served his tormenting master in the performance of all kinds of malicious deeds in service to the Infernal powers, spreading fear and terror in eastern Europe. As he served, the darkness took hold in his soul, until he truly was as evil as his victims believed him. With his conscience dead and his fear of his master fading, he seized the opportunity to aid the Quaesitores of the Order when his powerful mentor was Marched. This momentous decision made Tolides a sinister husk of a young magus, unable to cope with his ownerless freedom, or to fit into a Hermetic or mundane environment. Cursed by his heritage to only exist in places where the sun never shines, he now lives at the fringe of society, clinging to his studies in the hope of finding oblivion some day. Tolides is formally a member of House Flambeau, but maintains no ties to the politics of the Order. His Housemates are not keen to claim him as one of them. Having never known love, but only the foul and heinous whisperings of the Infernal, Tolides’ mind resembles a wild beast’s. He is a predator well trained in the art of destruction, but a cornered animal nonetheless. From his earliest youth he was raised to regard the Church as his greatest enemy, and the idea of seeking salvation does not occur to him. Unable to depart from his nightmarish course, Tolides, just like his master before him, is likely to be Marched. Tolides’ fate is tragic insofar as he, being a feral hunter rather than a sly plotter, has no real desire for power beyond what is necessary to secure his meager existence. He seeks peace and tranquility through the perfection of his art, but is unlikely to obtain either.''

''New Virtues and Flaws''

===New Virtue: See in Darkness===

''Minor, Supernatural You can see in complete darkness much the same as those with Strong Faerie Blood. Other than that, your eyesight is not more acute than ordinary people’s, and you do not see farther than normal people would see in daylight.''

===New Virtue: Immunity To Cold===

''Minor, Supernatural Normal cold does not harm you, nor does it make you feel uncomfortable. You don’t need warm environments to remain healthy (see Aging in ArM5, page 170).''
''Extreme, magically created cold, such as the effect of Wizard’s Icy Grip (ArM5, page 142), still affects you normally.''

===New Flaw: Susceptibility To Sunlight===

''Minor, Supernatural Direct, bright sunlight causes you noticeable pain and exhausts you. Attuned to darkness, your eyes are very sensitive, and you suffer from a –2 penalty to all rolls involving sight in bright environments such as a cloudless day. Due to your malediction, you lose one Fatigue level per Diameter if outdoors at noon on a hot summer day, and lose levels more slowly in less-intense light and warmth from the sun.''

Due to his dealings with the Infernal, and spending a lot of time in and exposed to Infernal auras, Tolides gained a considerable amount of Warping.''

The imp transforms its body into solid material, and slightly increases its weight. If lifted and touched in that form, it behaves and feels like a small figurine made of stone. While petrified, the gargoyle-like imp is unable to move, but can end its stasis at any time, or become incorporeal by dropping its Coagulation. It can slowly move its eyes to survey its surroundings, and anyone deliberately watching it doing so will notice it, if he succeeds at a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 6. See in Darkness, 0 points, Init n/a. Like Tolides, the imp is able to see in complete darkness. Unlike him, it is not affected by sunlight unless at noontime (see Weakness).''
''Source of Tranquility, 3 points, Init 0, Ignem. The imp can evoke an effect that is similar to the one provided by Tolides’ enchanted item of the same name, but with Duration Diameter only. Weakness: The imp is unable to use any of its powers during noontime; that is, the Diameter around midday. When exposed to direct sunlight during that time, it automatically assumes the form described in Petrification, and can not change back until dusk. Vis: 2 pawns of Vim, in its wings Appearance: The imp appears as a vaguely humanoid creature of about the size of a small kitten. Two leathery wings spring from its back that enable it to fly and hover about. The fiend’s naked skin is a dirty, reddish gray, and feels cool to the touch. Its limbs end in wicked claws that are too small to effectively harm a human, but that greedily grab for small donations it is offered. Proffered food is quickly devoured with its wide, fanged maw. Like a cat, the gaze of its dark eyes constantly darts around, detecting the slightest movement.''
''One day, Tolides is approached by an imp — a lesser demon — that offers to watch his back while he pursues his studies, asking little in return. This incident, though not particularly improbable for someone who occasionally deals with the Infernal, is unlikely to be completely coincidental. The Infernal Realm is not renowned for its benevolence or generosity. Being able to survey and, if necessary, to manipulate a precious pawn first hand is too valuable a chance for the Infernal powers to let slip, especially if it helps to strengthen the mutual bond. Tolides binds the imp that, like him, is primarily a creature of darkness, by calling upon his Perdo Ignem Lab Total. He establishes a Gold and Silver Cord of score 1 each, and a Bronze Cord of score 3.''

''New Spells''
''Most spells and enchantments that Tolides invented over the described period of time are supposed to further his goal to rid the world around him of light and warmth, to make it more bearable for him. Most of his creations are influenced by gloom and decay, reflecting their creator’s view of the world.''
''Corpus Spells''

===Track By Scent===

''MuCo(An) 4 R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind For the duration of the spell, the caster’s sense of smell is as sensitive as a staghound’s. Being a hunter through-and-through, Tolides frequently employs this spell to track down those who try to escape the punishment he has decided to deal them. (Base 2, +2 Sun, requisite free)''

===Evaluate the Facing Opponent===

''InCo 10 R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind Looking the target in the eye, the caster is able to sense any corporal affliction or ailment that might hamper the target’s physical movement. This includes, for example, injuries, fractures, and crippled limbs covered by clothes or armor. Note that the caster must face the target directly to scrutinize his or her physical condition. When Tolides developed this spell he did not own a mirror, but seriously considered acquiring one to extend the utility of the spell to diagnosing himself. (Base 5, +1 Eye)''

===Chastise the Unruly Antagonist===

''PeCo 10 R: Eye, D: Conc, T: Ind The target is overcome by intense pain. If the target tries to engage in activities that require concentration while under the effect of this spell, a successful Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 is required (ArM5, page 82). The dreadful effect of punishment lasts as long as the caster concentrates. In Tolides’ version of this spell, it appears as if the victim is wrapped in bands of darkness that tear at his flesh. (Base 4, +1 Eye, +1 Conc)''

===Retreat Into the Shell of Shadow===

''ReCo 15 R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind The caster instantly transports himself to any location he can see, not more than 50 paces distant. A puff of black, quickly dis''
''solving vapor is all that is left behind once the caster vanishes and reappears at the destination. If the initial point or endpoint of the leap is Warded, or if the caster’s magic is resisted, that resistance must be overcome much the same as when targeting a Warded area (see Aegis of the Hearth, ArM5, page 161). Tolides developed this spell to retreat into the shadow of a dark corner. If the endpoint of the transportation is exposed to unclouded daylight, Tolides must make a Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to gracefully reach his destination. A failure usually means that he tumbles and falls, is disorientated, or is enfeebled, whereas a botch calls for more-dramatic results to reflect his malediction. Note that this quirk is not a flaw of the spell, but an effect of Tolides’ Susceptibility to Sunlight. (Base 15)''

===Inner Darkness Unleashed===

''PeCo 20 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind The effect of this spell is similar to The Wound That Weeps (ArM5, page 133), though its cosmetic component and modified Range''
''make it appear somewhat differently. A wound opens on the body of the affected target, releasing black, oozing liquid similar to oil or tar. As it flows, the black substance is gradually replaced by the victim’s normal blood flow, effectively creating a Light Wound. (Base 5, +3 Sight, free cosmetic effect)''

===The Protesting Adversary Held Still===

''ReCo 20 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind The affected target is held fast and still for as long as the caster concentrates. Being held means that the target is unable to move his body, including his limbs, fingers, eyes, and lips. A magus who tries to cast spells while under the effect of this spell is likely to be subject to a penalty to his casting total, unless the intended magical effect does not require words and gestures (ArM5, page 83). In Tolides’ version of this spell, small ripples of darkness quiver over the body of the target that seem to function as ropes, holding his victim in place. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)''

===Blind the Insurgent Pack===

''PeCo 25 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group Black, oily tears appear in the eyes of all individuals of the affected Group, burning and blurring their vision. With their eyesight blurred, and all sources of light reduced to unrecognizable sparkles, affected targets are considerably hindered while performing actions that depend on eyesight. They are subject to a –3 penalty to all rolls that involve sight (see Poor Eyesight Flaw, ArM5, page 58). If left to themselves, the victims’ blurred vision heals as a Light Wound. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Group, free cosmetic effect)''
''Ignem Spells''

===Banishment of Warmth===

''PeIg 15 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle This practical spell expels the warmth from all items that have been set up inside the affected Circle. Lowering the temperature of the Circle to slightly above freezing, Banishment of Warmth can be used to prevent goods related to Animal, Herbam, or Corpus from decaying naturally for a couple of days. The spell is not designed as an offensive weapon, but living creatures that remain in the Circle for an extended period of time do start losing Fatigue due to the cold. Note that the spell must be cast after the targets have been set up inside the Circle; it does not affect items that are placed into the Circle once the spell has been cast. A closer look at the enchanted Circle reveals a translucent waft of vapor over the affected area. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Ring, free cosmetic effect)''

===Extinguish the Abhorrent Flame===

''PeIg 15 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind This spell instantly extinguishes any individual fire up to the size of a campfire. The extinguished fire can be relit by mundane or magical means, but does not relight by itself. To feel comfortable, Tolides shuns the heat and light of fires almost as much as he avoids''
''sunlight, and he uses this spell to extinguish flames even from afar. It also comes in handy for affecting the sources of light of those who depend on flames to see in the dark. (Base 4, +3 Sight)''

===Cloak of Darkness===

''PeIg 20 R: Sight, D: Diam, T: Part All light around the head of the target is completely extinguished, leaving the victim mobile and unhampered, but engulfed in a tight-fitting cloak of darkness — an aurora of opaque, black flame that moves with the target for the duration of the spell. The target is blind, unless affected by a spell that permits the caster to see in complete darkness, such as Eyes of the Bat. (Base 3, +3 Sight, +1 Diam, +1 Part, free cosmetic effect)''

===Orb of Darkness===

''PeIg 20 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Part This spell represents a larger variant of the Cloak of Darkness, and removes all light from the designated target area. The effect manifests in the form of a irregular sphere of writhing darkness that contains everything within three paces of the affected target. Anyone inside the affected space is effectively blind. To see through the area from either side, a spell that permits the target to see in complete darkness, like Eyes of the Bat, is required. The spell must be targeted at an object, individual, or other specific point in space. This location functions as a focus for the effect only, as the spell targets the light within the Part of space surrounding the focus, rather than the focus itself. Thus, the spell does not have to penetrate the Magic Resistance of anyone inside the target area, but only the resistance of the focus. If it fails to penetrate, the spell fails. If the focus is an individual or object that moves, the created darkness moves along with it. For example, if the spell is cast on a pebble, and that pebble is thrown into a lake, the blob of darkness will sink to the bottom. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +1 Part, +1 Size)''

===Abyssal Touch===

''PeIg 25 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Group''
''For two minutes, all members of the affected Group are thoroughly chilled. Living targets lose one Fatigue level per round until they fall unconscious, while objects are considered frozen. The chill does not persist long enough to actually damage living targets. In Tolides’ version of this spell, dark vapor emerges from the ground near the designated Group and engulfs the affected targets. The apparition does not physically constrict the victims, and does not block their senses, but keeps chilling them for the duration of the spell. (Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +2 Group)''

===Domain of Darkness===

''PeIg 45 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual This ritual creates a domain of darkness in the designated Boundary, which can cover an area with a diameter of nearly 1000 paces. No natural light that is brighter than a soft evening glow is ever shed within its Boundary, regardless of the season or time of day. Due to the continuous lack of sun, the whole area becomes cold and uncomfortable for living beings. Warm air from outside is not actively resisted, but almost never reaches the center of the domain. Even fires created by mundane or magical means appear weak, and only dimly lit. Plants within the Boundary turn to leafless caricatures of life sooner or later. Note that a Boundary requires a well-defined border, such as the tree line of a grove, the cliffs of a steep valley, or the shore of an island. A brief note on the specific use of this spell that should not to be mistaken for traits or side-effects of the spell itself: The area affected by Domain of Darkness provides a haven for all creatures that shun the light. It represents Tolides’ latest attempt to establish some sort of abode in a domain of his own. Because the affected Boundary is inhabited by a practicing diabolist, and the ritual needed to cast the spell is often powered by Infernal vis, the aura of the Boundary slowly but steadily accumulates more and more traits of Infernal Warping. For example, animals that stay inside the domain for an extended period of time are likely to turn into Corrupted Beasts — repellent aberrations of nature (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 77). One day, the affected Boundary might even become a regio of its own, which is exactly what Tolides has planned. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +4 Year, +4 Boundary, +2 Size)''
''Imaginem Spells''

===Chamber of Muffled Passing===

''PeIm 15 R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Room For the duration of two minutes, all sound inside the affected Room, regardless of its origin and volume, is completely muted. The spell affects mundane actions, such as creaking floor boards or shouting, in much the same way as spell casting that requires a voice. Due to his Quiet Magic, this limitation doesn’t impair Tolides much, unless he wants to cast an additional spell with Range Voice while inside the Room, or to affect a target across the threshold. In Tolides’ version of the spell, the affected Room is slightly tainted by darkness. Semi-translucent patches of murk slowly crawl along the walls of the Room, greedily devouring all sound from within or outside. Tolides is not very creative when it comes to finding names for his creations, and doesn’t care much about the ambiguous name of this spell that also describes the silenced deaths of those in the chamber whom Tolides decides to kill. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Diam, +2 Room)''
''Vim Spells''

===Chastise the Unruly Fiend===

''PeVi 10 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind The effect of this reinvented spell is practically equivalent to The Demon’s Eternal Oblivion, though its cosmetic component makes it appear somewhat differently. A black tentacle, similar to a writhing whip, lashes out from the caster’s palm to hit the targeted Infernal creature, reducing its Infernal Might score by 10 points. Brought close to destruction, a demon can be punished, and forced to obey, or at least to take the caster seriously. Note that the caster must be able to perceive or sense a demon to target it, and the spell must penetrate its Magic Resistance to take effect. (Base effect, +2 Voice, free cosmetic effect)''

===Belittle the Ferocious Warlock===

''PeVi 20 R: Sight, D: Diam, T: Ind Upon penetrating the Magic Resistance of the target, the spell reduces the casting total of the affected victim by 5 levels. The evocation does not hinder the movement or senses of the target in any way, but merely affects all magic that is cast. Note that this spell must be fast cast if it is supposed to take effect before the opponent can act in the first round. (See ArM5, pages 83 and 87.) In Tolides’ version of the spell, it appears as if the target is trapped in a dark cocoon of semi-transparent, wildly writhing vapor. (Base effect (4), +3 Sight, +1 Diam)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Tolides has created the following items.''
''Arrows of Defeat''
''Tolides created a set of enchanted arrows for a shady noble who had reason to fear his opponent’s cavalry’s strength in battle, and was pleased to learn about an effective means to counter this threat on the field. The arrows have been specifically designed to cover long distances, instead of featuring armor piercing or superior damage qualities. In the hands of an expert archer, and aimed at the ground right in front of the foremost rider, even a single well-placed arrow deals considerable damage to a small galloping army that is not quick enough to avoid the pit that seems to come from nowhere. The Lab Total used for this enchantment is 40, and thus yields six charges that Tolides distributes among six identical arrows with one charge each. As a set of charged items, the enchantment did not cost him any vis.''

===Gaping Maw of the Bottomless Pit===

''PeTe 10 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part The magical effect of the enchanted arrows is equivalent to the spell Pit of Gaping''
''Earth (ArM5, page 155), but operates at Range Touch instead of Voice. Consequently, each arrow, being a carrier for the spell, must be aimed and fired to reach its target, because the arrows themselves do not have any supernatural flight qualities. After leaving the string of the bow used to propel it forward, and upon touching solid, earthen ground, each of the enchanted arrows destroys earth as described for Pit of Gaping Earth.''
''As a typical trait of one of Tolides’ creations, black vapor eerily emerges from the bottom of the created pit and dissolves harmlessly into the surrounding environment. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 size, free cosmetic effect)''
''Torus of Fire Protection''
''An inconspicuous pendant, this enchanted item comes in the form of a small, brown torus made of fired clay. For Tolides, it serves as a constant means of protection against fire as long as the size of the threat does not exceed the size of a campfire. The Lab Total used to create this Lesser Enchantment includes a +4 material bonus for protection from fire for fired clay, and +4 for knowing Extinguish the Abhorrent Flame, a similar spell. The enchantment cost two pawns of vis.''

===Quench the Open Fire===

''PeIg 15 Pen +0, unlimited uses R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind''
''Small mundane fires that come into contact with the item are extinguished, as are magical flames that do not exceed +5 damage. Because it is the enchanted item that must be bathed in flames to extinguish a fire, and not the person who wears it, the pendant should be worn on top of the user’s clothes, and not underneath. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch; +10 unlimited uses)''
''Poniard of Deliverance''
''Tolides deployed an almost-identical dagger during his apprenticeship, but that weapon was confiscated by the Quaesitores at the time he turned in his former master. It had to be reconstructed from scratch by the now-ownerless magus. Although Tolides usually shuns open combat as worthy only of fools, he sometimes still succumbs to his predatory nature, and makes use of melee weapons instead of ranged magic to deal with an opponent face to face. The Lab Total used to create this Lesser Enchantment includes a +2 shape bonus for Precise Destruction for daggers. It cost two pawns of vis to create.''

===Appliance of Wrath===

''PeCo 20 Pen +10, 24/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind When activated by quickly flicking it in the wielder’s wrist, this dagger works as a medium for the embedded spell of destruction. Upon touching its target, the narrow blade deals a Light Wound in addition to any damage that is caused by the physical aspect of the weapon. (Effect: Base 5, +1 Touch; +5 penetration, +5 24/day)''
''Sting of the Viper''
''When Tolides fell victim to the alluring charm of a salacious creature, he agreed to protect her against her numerous enemies in return for a multitude of other services. His present for her came in the form of an ornate, nicely crafted hair pin of considerable size that is usually worn in combination with an equally impressive comb to hold and accentuate long, dark hair.

''Magical Weapons''
''Enchanted weapons based on PeCo that affect a target at Range Touch must hit the opponent to take effect; that is, they require a positive Attack Advantage. Armor made from Terram or Animal does not prevent damage caused by a Corpus effect per se, so the attack need not successfully deal damage. All mundane properties and statistics of a magical weapon apply normally, unless the weapon does not penetrate the Magic Resistance of the target (ArM5, page 85), in which case the weapon has no effect.''

|}
''comb and the handle of the pin appear to be made from ivory, but in fact are carved from human bone, while the needle blade is made from the finest steel. Not designed for open combat, the pin is light and swift, and fits perfectly into small, slender hands to serve as a tool for the art of assassination. It can only be used by the person for whom it was designed. The Lab Total used to create this Lesser Enchantment includes a +3 shape bonus for Assassination for daggers. It cost two pawns of vis to create.''

===The Fool’s Fate===

''PeCo 20 Pen +0, 3/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind When the pin is driven into the flesh of the target, black ripples spread from the puncture and run along the victim’s body, thereby causing a Medium Wound. The artifact does not include any Penetration, and is thus not of much use against targets with Magic Resistance. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch, free cosmetic effect; +3 effect use, +2 3/day)''
''Source of Tranquillity''
''The Lab Total used to create this Lesser Enchantment includes a +5 material bonus for darkness granted for items made of obsidian stone, and +5 for knowing Well Without Light, a similar spell. The creation cost three pawns of vis.''

===Chamber of Void===

''PeIg 24 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Constant, T: Room This enchantment is instilled in a tiny, obsidian figurine that resembles an ugly humanoid with folded wings. The effect of the enchantment completely and entirely extinguishes all light in the Room it is placed into for as long as the item remains in it. All perception based on vision is effectively impossible, unless the occupant is able to see in complete darkness. If the item is moved to a new room, the effect is transferred to that''
''room. If the figurine is not in a room, or is in a room too large for it to affect, the effect is temporarily suppressed. (Effect: Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; +2 Room; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger)''
''Rod of Mutilation''
''Tolides enchanted this rod for a diabolist in exchange for services received, one of which was the beneficiary’s aid with a nonHermetic variant of his longevity ritual, an endeavor the magus could not have undertaken on his own due to his deficiency in the Art of Creo. The item is a wand carved from human bone, shod in iron for better durability. It clearly bears the marks of its maker: the embedded destructive energy pulses in the form of vibrant darkness whenever the rod is used to hit a target. The Lab Total used to create this invested item includes a +4 material bonus for destroying the human body with an object made of human bone, and a multiplier of 5 due to effect expiration after seven years. A small item made of bone, the rod was opened with six pawns of vis, and invested with four pawns-worth of effects.''

===Crush the Adversary’s Limb===

''PeCo 33 Pen +10, 6/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This item can be used six times per day, for seven years after the first use. After activating the item by bouncing it longitudinally and successfully hitting a human target, the rod cripples the touched limb of that target. The affected limb appears as if crushed by black patches of darkness that ripple along it, and that dissipate as soon as the body part is broken and rendered useless. The victim of a broken leg is considered to suffer from the Lame Flaw (ArM5, page 55), while two broken legs effectively Cripple (ArM5, page 52) a person. One or two broken hands are equivalent to Missing Hand (ArM5, page 56), or No Hands (ArM5, page 56), respectively. Limbs damaged by the rod heal as a Medium Wound. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Part, free cosmetic effect; +5 penetration, +3 6/day)''
''Talisman: Orb of Immanent Darkness''
''Tolides’ talisman is a black obsidian orb. He has treasured the dark stone for as long as he can remember, mostly for its cool touch and the soothing of pain it seems to provide him. Still, it took him time and effort to collect enough knowledge and resources to undertake its attunement to the aspect of darkness. The orb is Tolides’ desperate attempt to counter the painful effect of his Susceptibility to Sunlight. His spell does not completely offset the effect of sunlight, but it at least softens some of the penalties he would suffer without this means of protection. While in possession of the item, Tolides can walk cloaked and hooded below the open daytime sky without suffering from loss of Fatigue. The murk created by the enchanted item does not spread further than the rim of his hood and sleeves, and looking around over a sunny landscape bathed in sunlight still causes him pain. Attentive bystanders see a deep, preternatural shadow under his hood, and with his obsidian eyes bereft of any reflection, there are no recognizable contours left under the black linen cloth. The Lab Total used for the instilled effect benefits from the +5 material bonus for darkness provided by obsidian, as well as from +2 for knowing Gloom of the Evening, a similar spell. Finally, the Lab Total gets +5 for the enchanter’s close connection to the talisman. It cost Tolides two pawns of vis to instill the effect, in addition to the four pawns required to open the item for enchantment.''
''Attunements +5 to spellcasting involving light’s absence''

===Soothing Shadows===

''PeIg 14 Pen +0, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part This item provides a constant effect. The intensity of light close to the head and upper part of the body of the person who carries the enchanted item is greatly reduced. It appears as if deep shadows are cast upon the bearer. A closer look will reveal an unnatural lack of light. (Effect: Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part; +3 environmental trigger, +1 2/day)''
