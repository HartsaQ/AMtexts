''Concept: This weaver’s faerie blood lets her produce enchanted cloth and clothing of the highest caliber, though she rejects her heritage and as a result is tormented by her fey ancestor — a spider prince.''
''Julia Textrix of Ex Miscellanea is a maga from the Rusticani tradition (Houses of Hermes: Societates, pages 130–133), magi who excel in the combination of mundane crafts and arcane magic. She was born at the covenant of Florum in the Normandy Tribunal (see The Lion and the Lily, page 96), and is a member of the de Spinnen family who all bear a peculiar variety of Faerie Blood, that of a faerie spider. An encounter with her faerie ancestor at an early age left her with a deadly fear of the creature, and, by extension, all spiders. Consequently she would not be educated at Florum, and instead was apprenticed to one of the covenant’s associates from whom she learned the art of magical weaving. Her faerie blood allows her to convert her own body weight of raw fibers into finished cloth every day. Her tradition-specific Virtue of Craft Magic allows her advantages to spellcasting while practicing some mundane craft; see Houses of Hermes: Societates, pages 131–132 for more details. All her spells are affected by her Side Effect Virtue, in that they do not end instantly when the duration ends, but instead gradually fade away. This is barely noticeable for Momentary and Diameter Duration spells, but it takes about an hour for her Duration: Sun spells, whereas Duration: Moon and Year spells diminish over the course of a day. This fading period is also extended by her Enduring Magic; a spell that has actually lasted four Moon durations takes four days to fade away to nothing. Many of Julia’s spells employ Rego Craft Magic, for more details see Covenants, page 49. Julia is somewhat of a loner, preferring not to join a covenant but instead selling the products of her magical craft to any who will buy them. Her fabulous cloth is highly''
''sought after by the rich, for she can create miraculous colors and effects impossible with mundane dyes. She is careful not to draw too much attention to herself through this trade, working principally through a middleman who cheats her outrageously, but she doesn’t mind since it keeps the Quaesitores off her back. Since her cloths are usually charged items, the magical properties fade over time, giving her a steady trade. She receives news of the families of her customers from her vendor, and is a keen follower of the social whirl from which she is forever barred due to her Gift. Instead she sometimes impregnates her fabrics with magical impulses intended to improve the lives of those who wear them. The spider prince who is her ancestor resents her rejection of him, and sends his many-legged minions to torment her on a regular basis.''

He is a handsome bird, with black plumage, red wattles, white wing-bars, and a lyreshaped tail.

''Julia’s choice of familiar — a black grouse — was somewhat whimsical; she was struck by the pun of “textrix” (“weaver”) with “tetrix” (“grouse”), but discovered a bird who is a fierce hunter of spiders.

Grouse eat plant shoots and insects; when hunting the latter he has a +3 bonus to his Attack Total in the first round of combat if his opponent is unaware of his presence.

''New Spells''
''Julia has developed several new spells, details of which are given here.''
''Animal Spells''

===Shearing the Unseen Sheep===

''CrAn 20 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Creates a sheep’s fleece. Wool is the most common material for making clothing, but creating ready-made woolen garments''
''is difficult with Hermetic Magic. As a consequence, Julia uses this spell to create the raw materials, and then rearranges them into clothing using Rego Craft Magic, such as Woolen Garments for the Human Form, below. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Sturdy Mantle of the Traveler===

''CrAn 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Creates a gardcorps — a calf-length traveling robe with voluminous sleeves. The garment is formed of supple leather oiled to proof it against rain. A Finesse roll determines the quality of the gardcorps; an Ease Factor of 6 results in a waterproof robe of standard quality. If an Ease Factor of 9 is achieved the caster can determine the color of the leather and a specific regional style. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 treated and processed)''

===Madder, Woad, and Weld===

''MuAn(He) 20 R: Touch, D: Month, T: Group The touched cloth — which can be''
''wool, cotton, or linen — takes on a vivid hue as if dyed. Up to ten skeins of wool or 5 bolts of cloth can be dyed a single color chosen by the caster at the time of casting. When the spell’s duration expires, the cloth reverts to its natural undyed color. The spell is named after the three principle dyes employed in the thirteenth century — madder produces red, brown, and pink, woad makes blue, and weld results in yellow. By dyeing and then over-dyeing with a different color, a whole range of russets, maroons, greens, and oranges can be produced through mundane craft. However, a single casting of this spell can produce any possible hue. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +3 Month, +2 Group, +1 requisite)''

===Cloak of Nessus===

''MuAn 35 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Part The targeted item of clothing partially converts into poison. The wearer suffers terrible agony as the poison touches his skin, and must make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to avoid taking a Light Wound. This Stamina roll must be repeated every round that the wearer is in contact with the robe, or until the Duration ends. The spell is named after the cloak dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus in Greek myth. Since creating a poison of this strength has a base level of 15 (if it were an Aquam effect), two magnitudes are added for this effect, although since the poison is of Animal origin an Aquam requisite is not needed. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +1 Part, +2 poison effect)''

===The Unraveled Seam===

''PeAn(He) 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part The touch of the caster causes a thread of animal or plant origin to decay, making the cloth it is holding together to come apart. The pieces of cloth can be sewn together again, so this is counted as damaging the garment rather than destroying it. (base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +1 requisite)''

===The Unraveled Clothes===

''PeAn(He) 15 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group The targeted clothing falls apart as all''
''the stitches — both thread and leather — simultaneously unravel. The victim of this spell is left naked. If the victim is wearing leather armor (including metal-reinforced leather armor) then the armor falls into pieces. If the victim is wearing metal armor, the padding beneath the armor is affected. A character in this position suffers a –3 to all physical actions due to the shifting of his armor, and it grants only half of its Protection until the padding can be replaced. The clothes are capable of being repaired, so this is counted as damaging the garment rather than destroying it. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Group, +1 requisite)''

===The Wizard’s Spindle===

''ReAn 4 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group The caster converts up to 10 fleeces into wool. The wool is cleaned, carded, and spun in a single round. This requires a Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 12, since it replicates more than a week’s work completed in an instant. Failure to achieve this Ease Factor leaves the wool hopelessly tangled and useless. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Group)''

===Dressing the Human Form in Wool===

''ReAn 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This spell crafts a single woolen garment from either raw fleeces or from spun wool. This spell is suitable for producing a cotte, cyclas, ganache, bliaut, cappa, or chausses (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert). A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 12 if raw fleece is employed, or 9 if the base material is spun wool. The clothes produced are of standard quality; increase the Ease Factor for particularly fine or complex craft. If the Finesse roll fails, the caster is left with a useless mess of wool. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor. Julia typically uses this spell to manufacture clothes out of the magical cloth that she makes (see Enchanted Items, later). She does not have a spell that directly creates mundane clothing of wool due to the difficulty (it would be a similar spell to Sturdy Mantle of the Traveler, earlier). Instead, it is much easier to simply create fleeces (see Shearing the Unseen Flock, later) and then craft''
''them into clothing with this spell. This spell employs the Level 3 Rego Animal guideline on page 50 of Covenants: “treat and process items made of animal products.” (Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 complexity)''

===Ward Against Faeries Which Creep and Crawl===

''ReAn 20 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle No faerie animal whose Faerie Might is equal or less to the level of the spell can affect the targeted Group as long as they remain within the ring. Julia commonly employs this spell every night along with a Circle of Beast Warding — after carefully sweeping the area to ensure that no spiders become trapped in the ring with her. (As ward guideline)''

===Constraint of the Strangling Vestments===

''ReAn 35 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Group The target’s clothes develop a life of their own, and tighten around their owner’s limbs rendering him unable to move. This spell only affects clothes of wool, leather, and fur. The constricting clothing makes it very hard for the wearer to breathe, and he risks strangulation; causing him to make a Deprivation roll (ArM5, pages 180–181) every 30 seconds (or 5 combat rounds). Since Rego Animal lacks a guideline for making an animal product move with a purpose, the Rego Herbam guidelines have been used as an analogy. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +2 Group)''

''Clothing in the Thirteenth Century''
''Many of Julia’s spells create or craft items of clothing; this insert gives some details on the broad trends in clothing across Europe. Readers are encouraged to investigate the individual styles of the country in which their saga is set for a more-accurate picture of clothing. The basic items of clothing for both sexes and all social classes are the chainse, the cotte, and the surcoat. The chainse is a linen smock with tight sleeves worn next to the skin for comfort. The more fashionable man wears a doublet (made of two layers of linen) or a jupe (quilted and padded chainse). On top of the chainse is the tunic or cotte, which typically has sleeves as far as the elbows. Commoners typically wear shorter cottes than gentlefolk; the short cotte reaches the knees (for men) or the ankles (for women) whereas the long cotte is ankle-length (for men) and floorlength (for women). A women’s cotte is sometimes called a gown or kirtle. Over the cotte is worn a surcoat that comes in a number of styles. The commonest — worn by both men and women — is the cyclas, which is a straight-sided sleeveless outer tunic that reaches the knees. The ganache is similar to the cyclas but has a matching hood and is typically worn by merchants and scholars. The height of fashion in surcoats in the thirteenth century is the bliaut, which is a long outer tunic reaching''
''from the shoulders to the knees and wrists. It is shaped to hug the figure tightly at the waist and elbow. From the waist down the bliaut has full skirts, and from the elbow the sleeves flare into a trumpet shape. The sleeves and skirt are sometimes gored with a contrasting color. Both the cotte and surcoat are typically made of dyed wool, with red, green, and blue being the rarest (and thus most fashionable) colors. On the legs both sexes wear chausses, or hose, made as separate garments for each leg and reaching above the knee. Braies are linen drawers of varying length whose legs are tucked into the top of the hose to prevent them from falling down. Shoes are typically “turnshoes,” made inside out; they are comparatively flimsy in construction and typically wear out after a few months. When traveling, a cloak or cape is commonly worn; the cappa is a short hooded cape that covers the upper torso, whereas the mantle is a more-extensive affair lined with fur. Headgear for a man is either a straw hat, a round cap, a beret, a coif, or a chaperon. The coif is a tight-fitting linen hood that is tied beneath the chin with strings, whereas a chaperon is a hood that covers the head and shoulders. Women’s hats usually have a barbette (chin band) attached. They typically don coifs; the wimple and veil are considered old-fashioned but still worn by the older generation.''

''Magi of Hermes Corpus Spells''

===Sealing the Lips===

''ReCo 10 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind The target is rendered unable to speak. It appears that his lips have been stitched together; this is a cosmetic effect. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)''
''Herbam Spells''

===Clothe the Naked Form===

''CrHe 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Creates an individual garment made of linen or cotton, most commonly undergarments such as the chainse or braies (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert). A Finesse roll determines the quality of the clothes; an Ease Factor of 6 results in a garment of standard quality. If an Ease Factor of 9 is achieved then the caster can specify the brightness of the dye and any regional variations in style. Julia uses this spell rather than The Tailor’s Craft Done in an Instant when she has no cloth at hand. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 treated and processed)''

===The Travelers’ Fortress of Cloth===

''CrHe 20 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group This spell creates a tent of waterproof canvas and wooden poles that is large enough to sleep 10 people. The canvas sides appear to grow out of surrounding vegetation, and erect and fasten themselves together. A Finesse roll determines the complexity and comfort of the tent; if the basic Ease Factor of 6 cannot be achieved then the tent leaks and has a musty smell, whereas an Ease Factor of 9 results in a pavilion of superior quality. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +2 treated and finished product)''

===Weaver’s Trap of Threads===

''CrHe 20 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group A huge net of thick threads grows in the indicated area, filling a space 5 paces by 5 paces by 6 feet high. With supports the nets can hang vertically, forming a wall, otherwise they act just like a fishing net. Everyone caught in the area is captured within the nets. Getting free requires a Strength stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9; or else someone who is not trapped may use an edged weapon to free a victim, which takes three rounds. Fire is exceptionally effective against the nets, but risks burning anyone caught within. The nets are not sticky, and cannot trap anyone who stumbles into them. This spell is a deliberate reference to the better-known spell Weaver’s Trap of Webs, but the thought of emulating a spider is abhorrent to the arachnophobic Julia. Consequently, her version of this spell is less potent, as linen threads are less strong than spider’s silk. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group)''

===The Clothier’s Craft Done in an Instant===

''ReHe 4 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Given an amount of linen or cotton cloth, the caster forms it into a garment according to her specifications. Typical garments made with this spell are the chainse or braies (see the Clothing of the Thirteenth Century insert) which are traditionally made of linen. A Finesse roll is necessary to determine the success of the craft magic; the Ease Factor is 9 for clothes of standard quality since it represents a day’s work done in an instant. If the Finesse roll fails the caster is left with a useless pile of scraps of cloth. Creating a fabric of a different color than the raw material requires a supply of appropriate dye, but does not change the Ease Factor. Julia typically uses this spell to manufacture clothes out of the magical cloth that she makes (see Enchanted Items). If starting with raw flax or cotton fibers, this spell would have needed to use the level 5 Rego Herbam guideline “treat and process items made of plant products” given in Covenants, page 51. Julia has no need for this version, since her Faerie Blood allows her to effect the transformation from fiber to cloth anyway. (Base 3, +1 Touch)''

===The Mended Tear===

''ReHe 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part The caster lays a piece of linen or cotton thread over a rent in any fabric and runs her finger over it; the cloth or leather is immediately repaired with a neat stitch. This Craft Magic spell requires successful Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Part)''

===The Animate Attire===

''ReHe 20 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind One item of clothing starts to writhe and thrash under the direction of the caster. The clothing causes a major distraction to its wearer and can trip him up; he suffers a –3 to all actions, and rolls 3 extra botch dice while under the effect of this spell. While thirteenth century clothes are predominantly made of wool, underclothes are made of linen and this spell produces the best effect when cast on the victim’s chainse or braies. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)''

===Embroidering the Wizard’s Robes===

''ReHe 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The caster traces out a design on a piece of cloth, and a piece of thread follows her finger and is embroidered into the cloth. A Finesse roll of Ease Factor 9 is required for simple designs, but a 12 is needed for intricate embroidery. Failure to achieve this Ease Factor results in a tangled mess that needs to be unpicked by hand. Julia often “signs” any cloth or clothes she makes using this spell. (Base 15, +1 Touch)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Julia created the following items.''
''Loom of the Kabouters''
''This beautiful loom is expertly made from elm and is a vertical loom, a relatively''
''recent introduction into Mythic Europe from the East. Every component is made from carefully carved wood; it does not have a single metal hinge, nail, or bolt. The only components that are not wooden are the stone weights keeping the warp threads taut during weaving, and these can be easily removed. The kabouters after whom the loom is named are a diminutive race of urban faeries from Julia’s Flemish homeland, and she thought it appropriate to honor their skill in naming the item. The loom is a huge item of wood, and thus was prepared with ten pawns of Vim vis, of which six spaces still remain.''

===Loom of Elfin Proportions===

''MuHe 23 Pen 0, 6/day R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind The loom can be shrunk to a tenth of its former size in each dimension, entailing a thousand-fold reduction in weight. Whereas it once stood six feet high, it is now only seven inches tall and can be easily carried in a backpack. Julia has a special box in which she keeps the shrunken loom so that none of the components will be lost or damaged in transit. This spell is designed based on the Object of Increased Size spell (ArM5, page 154), but has an extra magnitude of complexity to make the loom shrink to a smaller size than allowed by that spell. (base 4, +1 Conc, +1 size, +1 complexity; +5 item maintains concentration, +3 6 per day)''

===Panorama of the Heinzelmännchen===

''ReAn 10 Pen 0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group The loom weaves wool into an intricate tapestry described when the effect is triggered. The operator’s skill at describing the effect in magical terms determines the quality of the tapestry; a Finesse roll of Ease Factor 12 is the minimum for a simple scene of standard quality. More-complex designs require higher Ease Factors. The finished tapestry can be any size up to one hundred square paces, and is woven exceptionally quickly rather than literally in a moment. The Heinzelmännchen are German brownies who are skilled at making clothes and weaving cloth. (base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 size, +1 intricacy)''
''The Fruit of the Loom''
''This brooch is an unremarkable piece of jewelry consisting of twisted ropes of copper wire forming a simple warp and weft pattern beneath a cast copper apple. This tiny item of base metal was prepared with five pawns of Vim vis, and has currently been instilled with three pawns’ worth of effects.''

===The Everchanging Garments===

''MuAn(He) 28 Pen 0, 6/day R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Group The clothes to which the brooch is pinned can be utterly changed in their style and components, although animal products must remain animal products and plant-based fabrics must remain plant-based. However, a woolen cyclas could be turned into a silk bliaut, and a cotton gown could become a linen scarf. Dyed materials retain their color, but possibly alter shade according to the natural color of the base material. The wielder of the item must briefly describe the clothing she desires, then make a Finesse roll to determine how exactly her instructions are carried out; an Ease Factor of 6 is needed to successfully emulate a simple change, but if the current clothes require dramatic improvement then the Ease Factor is higher. The clothes remain changed until the wielder desires to cancel the effect, but she must briefly concentrate to maintain it at sunrise or sunset. (base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Group, +1 requisite; +5 item maintains concentration, +3 6/day)''
''Magical Cloth''
''Julia’s stock in trade is the creation of fabulous cloths that cannot be duplicated with mundane craft. She makes these fabrics as charged items using her Craft Magic Virtue rather than the usual process for making charged items. While this means she uses her Casting Total rather than her Laboratory Total, it takes her mere days to instill the effects rather than a season. Since she can manufacture at least one sheet of fabric each day through mundane means, it takes her one day per charge to create these charged items. She usually instills one charge into each sheet. For example, if her Casting Total is 23, it takes four days to make four sheets of cloth containing the Iridescence of the''
''Mallard’s Head effect, each holding one charge. She generally does not trigger the magic of the charged item until it has been formed into a garment, and each piece of cloth can have only a single magical effect. Julia’s Enduring Magic often extends the duration of each effect to be much longer than specified.''

===Iridescence of the Mallard’s Head===

''MuIm 4 Pen 0, charged item R: Per, D: Month, T: Ind When triggered, this effect causes the dull green of the cloth to adopt an iridescent color not dissimilar to that found on the feathers of certain birds. When the effect fades the cloth reverts to its former color. (Base 1, +3 Month)''

===Staunch the Bloody Wound===

''CrCo 10 Pen 0, charged item R: Touch, D: Month, T: Ind When triggered, bandages made from this cloth give a +3 to Wound Recovery rolls. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +3 Month)''

===Scintillation of the Phoenix===

''CrIg 10 Pen 0, charged item R: Per, D: Month, T: Ind When triggered, this orange-yellow cloth glows with a light equivalent to torchlight and flickers like a living flame. This cloth is particularly popular among members of House Flambeau, who in the past have commissioned Julia to make ceremonial robes for attending the tribunal. (Base 3, +3 Month)''

===Constrain the Shrewish Wife===

''MuMe 15 Pen 0, charged item R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind When triggered, clothes made from this cloth cause the wearer to become more considerate towards his or her loved ones. Julia occasionally hears of clients who are having trouble at home and make them clothes from this cloth to encourage better behavior. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)''

===Curb the Straying Husband===

''MuMe 15 Pen 0, charged item R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind When triggered, clothes made from this cloth cause the wearer to become temperate, eschewing drink, violent behavior, and philandering. Julia makes clothing of this fabric for clients who have troublesome husbands. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)''

===Cloth of Unicorn Hair===

''Level 20 Pen 0, charged item R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Not actually formed from the hair of a unicorn (despite what she tells clients!), clothes made from this cloth grant the wearer immunity to poison. This effect is a product of Julia’s Craft Magic rather than Hermetic Magic, and her “Casting Total” is equal to a Dexterity + Craft (Linen or Wool, as appropriate) roll instead. See Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 131 for more details. The name is appropriate since she makes this cloth so rarely due to its difficulty. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''
''Talisman: Forfex Princeps''
''The “Prince of Shears” is Julia’s talisman. These clothier’s shears are two feet long and constructed from iron. Inlaid onto the blades are intricate filigrees of gold, copper, and lead. The invested item was initially prepared with ten pawns of Vim vis and currently has no enchantment space remaining.''
''Attunements +2 Shaping Fabric (cloth shears) +7 Harm/Repel Faeries (iron) +4 Deftness (copper) +4 Wards (lead)''

===Snip the Thread of a Faerie’s Might===

''PeVi 25 Pen 20, 24/day R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind Weakens a faerie. If the effect penetrates the Faerie’s Might then it loses 10 points of Might. (Base 0, +2 Voice; +10 Pen 30, +5 24/day)''

===Sever Wood and Bone===

''PeAn(He) 12 Pen 0, 3/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind''
''The shears can cut through any animal or plant substance that they can close around. This effect is rarely used for mundane tasks, since Julia is sufficiently skilled. Instead, she uses it where shears would not normally cut, like through bone or wood. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 requisite; +2 3/day)''

===Gather the Connection===

''ReCo(An) 30 Pen 10, 1/day R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind When triggered, this effect snips a lock of hair from the target (either human or animal) and delivers it to the wielder’s hand. If done in a surreptitious fashion, the target must make a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to realize that some of his hair has been stolen. Naturally Julia uses this effect to gain Arcane Connections, but uses it with caution for there is the real risk she could take hair from a magus unknowingly. This spell duplicates the mundane action of cutting hair, and does not need a Perdo requisite. (Base 15, +2 Voice; +5 Pen 10)''

===Sunder Stone===

''PeTe 12 Pen 0, 3/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The shears can cut through any mineral substance that they can close around — metal, glass, or stone. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 affect metal; +2 3/day)''
