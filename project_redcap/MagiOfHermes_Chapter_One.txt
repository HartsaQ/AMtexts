''Concept: A magus who spends his life exploring the deserts of North Africa, developing spells to change himself and his attendants into animals to better travel in those harsh lands.''
''Even as an apprentice, Alexander was fascinated by the idea of traveling to North Africa and visiting its ruins. His indulgent master equipped him with the sorts of skills and spells that allow him to find trouble, but not necessarily overcome it. He rectifies this lack later in life. Alexander of Jerbiton is of average height, with olive skin and dark hair. He is scrawny when young, becoming wiry as he ages. His skin becomes increasingly leathery and his face becomes more lined, due to his exposure to the heat of the Egyptian climate. He wears the clothing of the locals wherever he goes.''

''In emergency situations, where food has been scarce, Alexander has occasionally turned his group into bats, fed them insects or tiny amounts of fruit, and then allowed the spell to lapse in the morning. A well-nourished bat transforms into a well-nourished human, so this extends an expedition’s supplies markedly.

''Camels are well adapted to arid environments. They can find water by smell: open water sources have the same distinct smell as the air after rain. Camels can survive without water for extended periods, and are able to travel in mild sandstorms without harm. Their hooves have a unique design that splays when they travel on loose-packed surfaces, like sand, so that they do not sink into it as deeply as a human or hoofed animal does.

''Combat: Bite: Init +3*, Attack +10, Defense +9, Damage +6* * 	 Gains +3 if it takes its prey by surprise, for the first round only (Ambush Predator). ** 	 Includes a +3 bonus for Crushing Jaws: reflects the fact that although crocodiles are not particularly strong compared to humans, the muscles with which they bite down are tremendously powerful. The muscles which open its mouth are comparatively weak. A human may hold a crocodile’s jaws closed with a successful Grapple. Soak: +2 Fatigue Levels: OK, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1, (1–8), –3 (9–16), –5 (17–24) Incapacitated (25+) Abilities: Athletics 2 (short sprints and lunges), Awareness 3 (food), Brawl 5 (in water), Hunt 4 (prey), Stealth 4 (stalking prey), Survival 3 (river), Swim 2 (rivers) Powers: Death Roll: 0 points, Init +3: A crocodile that has successfully bitten a foe may roll in the following round. When a crocodile rolls, it either twists away a chunk of the flesh of its victim (doing +6 damage) or, if possible, drags its victim beneath the surface of the water. It then uses its Amphibious Quality to wait for the victim to drown. To prevent injury or submersion from a roll, the victim must treat this as a successful grappling attack with an Attack Advantage of 10. If a character is being drowned by a crocodile, the character may attempt to break free of the crocodile’s jaws each round. This requires''
''the character to overcome a successful Grapple attack with an Attack Advantage of 10. If the character does break free, the crocodile is likely to bite again. Appearance: Crocodiles are very difficult to spot in the water, as they have special scales that prevent them leaving surface ripples when they swim, and are colored to provide camouflage.''
''Crocodiles have a sense of the movement of water around their bodies, which allows them to track nearby moving objects without looking at them.''

''Equipment for Alexander’s Attendants''
''Alexander’s attendants are often transformed into animals. It is vital that his party have equipment that does not require requisites to transform. Armor: Alexander’s attendants usually wear quilted armor (ArM5 page 176) made of woolen thread. An expert armorer would quickly determine that the armor had been made so that small pieces of metal that are usual in its construction have been replaced with pieces of bone. Weapons: Alexander’s grogs often lose their weapons when they change shape, if they are forced to flee. To compensate for this, some of his warriors carry large fighting knives and clubs made from''
''animal bone, horn, or ivory with leather and beeswax grips. These weapons do –2 Damage compared to their steel counterparts in the tables on pages 176 and 177 of ArM5, except daggers and knives, which do –1 Damage. All of these weapons are likely to break on botches. Water: The greatest flaw in Alexander’s transformations is that the water his grogs are carrying, in leather skins, does not transform when the skins do, and so it is always lost. He has tried various solutions to this problem, but none have proven promising. His troops always carry a little mead or kumis (fermented honey or milk), but that offers no protection against dehydration.''

It can weigh up to 490 pounds and have a body length of over ten feet. It has a short, broad muzzle with powerful jaws and teeth. Its coat is tawny and the male lion has a dark, shaggy mane. The fearsome roar of the lion can be heard from a great distance.''
''New Spells''
''Alexander has developed the following new spells.''
''Animal Spells''

===Recruiting a Tiny Phalanx===

''Cr(Re)An 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group This spell allows Alexander to create a swarm of scorpions. The swarm, combined, has the mass of a human being. The spell has a Rego requisite, which allows Alexander to command the swarm to do things other than chase beetles and run from larger creatures. In dangerous areas, he often casts two Circles of Beast Warding, one slightly larger than the other, around the area where his party is going to camp. He then pours scorpions into the ring this creates, and orders them to attack anyone else that crosses the ring, casting the spell multiple times if he feels it is necessary. This technique also has the advantage that if he botches the spell, and creates a swarm of enraged and uncontrollable scorpions, he need only wait safe behind his inner Circle of Beast Warding for them to disappear. Scorpion venom is painful, but individual stings are rarely fatal for healthy people. In areas where scorpions are common, the allergy that causes their sting to be fatal may be taken as a Minor Flaw. An attacking swarm''
''of scorpions does +10 damage automatically each round, but this can be Soaked normally. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Group, +1 Rego requisite)''

===Scales of the Scorpions===

''MuAn Level 40 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Group Alexander uses this ability to plate friendly animals, including his grogs when transformed, in chitinous armor. These plates are enormous versions of the armor that protect scorpions. This grants +3 Soak. (Base 15, +2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 Group)''
''Aquam Spells''

===Bag of Teeth===

''MuAq(An) 20 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind Transforms a pool of water into an animal tooth. When on expedition, Alexander often carries several of these teeth. They are not a perfect solution to water shortage, because Alexander, while young, cannot dispel this effect, so the water only becomes available when the spell expires. If forced to use his emergency water, Alexander prefers to first create a sanctuary using A Place of Recuperation and A Time for Slumber, then ration his water by keeping his servants, and himself, in diminutive animal forms until the Bag of Teeth reverts to gallons of water. Each tooth may become just under a hundred cubic feet of water. This means that the teeth destroy any closed container they are stored within when they change back. They are able to cause explosions, but Alexander has never considered their military potential. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, requisite free)''
''Auram Spells''

===Clouds of Obscuring Sand===

''CrAu 30 R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Group''
''Alexander uses this spell to call up a small, but severe, sandstorm. This obscures the vision of everyone within an area 1000 paces across, and prevents travel by those unprepared for sandstorms. Alexander uses Movement Within the Sirocco to allow him to move freely through the storm, although navigation by sight remains difficult unless he takes bird form, using The Shadow on the Sand, to rise above the affected area. (Base 3, +3 Sight, +2 Sun +2 Group (for larger area))''

===Movement Within the Sirocco===

''ReAu 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Allows Alexander, or the person he touches, to operate in the worst possible sandstorms. Alexander uses it when a sudden storm occurs, so that he can then cast Ward Against the Sirocco. It has also proven useful while battling some of the wind creatures that guard the Kushite ruins in which he has developed an interest. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Ward Against the Sirocco===

''ReAu 25 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle Wards against sandstorms by repelling the breezes that carry dust. It is powerful enough to defend Alexander and his servants from the most powerful sandstorms. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''
''Corpus Spells''

===Eyes of the Housecats===

''MuCo(An) 20 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group The targets gain the ability to see as a cat sees, allowing them to operate normally in low-light conditions. Alexander prefers his group to travel at night when in desert locations, to avoid the heat in the middle of the day. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, requisite free)''

===The Guardian of the Tombs===

''MuCo(An) 20 R: Per, D:Sun, T:Ind When faced with animals that might feed upon his camel form, Alexander uses this spell to take the shape of a cobra. Many predators find snakes intimidating or too small to be suitable prey. While in snake form, Alexander can detect the movement of nearby animals through vibrations in the ground, and he has a poisonous bite. If Alexander bites something hollow, so that his poison is injected into it, the poison does not disappear when he returns to human form. Some of Alexander’s grogs occasionally use his poison to envenom their arrows. Alexander has a serpent skin wristband that he uses as a physical focus for the spell, so that he can cancel it at will. (Base 10, +2 Sun)''

===The Desert Wanderer===

''MuCo(An) 25 R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Alexander uses this spell to transform into an Arabian camel. This allows him to travel through the arid regions of Northern Africa more easily than if he had human shape. In this form he has the innate abilities of a camel, which includes the ability to detect the direction and distance of water for many miles, by scent. He has a belt made of camel leather that acts as a focus for this spell, enabling him to dispel it at will. (Base 10, +2 Sun, +1 for size change)''

===The Shadow On the Sand===

''MuCo(An) 30 R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind The ability to take the shape of a vulture allows Alexander to forage for food, and travel swiftly over areas that do not interest him. Vultures have exceptionally keen eyesight, so he is able to observe distant events on the ground in this form. Vultures are also considered birds of ill-omen, and he has occasionally used this shape to unnerve mundanes. Alexander has a strand of vulture feathers that he uses as a physical prop to allow this spell to be canceled at will. (Base 20, +2 Sun)''

===Retreat As Flying Vermin===

''Mu(Co)An 35 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Circle This spell allows Alexander to turn a group of people, and their Animal-based equipment, into bats. It was designed to be used as a spell that would allow his grogs to rapidly retreat from danger, but the effect Alexander desired is slightly beyond his skill, so he needs to draw a circle before the spell can be used. He plans to use it only in emergencies, because his grogs will lose those items of equipment that are not based on animal products when it is used, which includes their weapons. If forced to use this spell to flee a foe, Alexander plans to use Clouds of Obscuring Sand, and perhaps Ward Against the Sirocco first. He has a piece of bat leather in a small bag of trinkets he always carries, to use as a physical prop if this spell is cast. (Base 20, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===The Lurker in the Rushes===

''MuCo(An) 40 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell transforms Alexander, or someone he touches, into a crocodile. Crocodiles are fearsome foes in combat around water, and the stealth of the crocodile makes grogs that have experience with the form into useful amphibious or aquatic scouts. Alexander has a crocodile skin dagger scabbard, which he uses to cancel the spell at will. (Base 20, +1 Touch, +2 Sun. Crocodiles are treated as fish when selecting a base level for this spell, +1 great Size change)''

===a Punishment for Brigands===

''MuCo(An) 40 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell transforms a human into a mouse. While in mouse form, the victim of this spell may be affected by Circle of Beast Warding, which prevents him or her from fleeing if cast swiftly enough. This allows the mouse to be gathered into a bag and transferred to a place of confinement, or casually destroyed. (Base 10, +2 Voice +2 Sun, +2 Group)''

===a Source of Tremendous Pride===

''MuCo(An) 45 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group Used to transform the covenant’s ser''
''vants into a pride of lions. Medieval bestiaries recognize three varieties of lion. Male lions of the straight-maned type, which this spell produces, are lazier than female ones, and this has led to the formation of a small cadre of female warriors in the covenant, who are skilled in unarmed combat. A few carry bone weapons. Alexander sometimes uses a tail spur he carries in his trinket pouch as a physical prop to allow this spell to be canceled at will. (Base 10, +2 Voice +2 Sun +2 Group +1 for size change)''
''Herbam Spells''

===Bag of Feathers===

''MuHe(An) 35 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Group This spell is used to lessen the load carried by expeditions, by transforming all of the food supply they must carry, excepting that required during the spell’s duration, into feathers. In Alexander’s case each type of food becomes a different color and pattern of feather, so that servants who travel with him learn to read which feather is which provision. Food in feather form does not spoil, although it often tastes slightly of chicken after it regains its original form. Note that the food does not change back when the caster wishes; without Perdo Vim magic, he must wait for the duration to end. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Group, +1 requisite (changes animal products into lighter animal products).''
''Ignem Spells''

===Conflagratious Lanyard===

''MuIg(An) 30 This is a spell Alexander designed to avenge a personal slight. This spell transforms a large campfire into a bootlace, glove, thong, lanyard, belt, or similar leather product, for Moon Duration. When the spell’s duration expires, the campfire continues burning as a natural fire, if it has sufficient fuel and air. A person wearing the item suffers +5 Damage in the first round, and in''
''each subsequent round provided the fire has sufficient fuel to continue burning. Alexander appears to have used this spell to burn all of his rival’s favorite clothes, by incinerating the contents of a closet. Rumors that the rival’s ship was lost at sea with all hands have never been proven. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, requisite free)''

===a Time for Slumber===

''PeIg 5 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle When this spell is cast around a camp, it dims the blinding light of the desert sun. This allows grogs and animals to sleep more easily. Alexander uses it in conjunction with A Place of Recuperation when on expedition. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''

===a Place of Recuperation===

''PeIg 15 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle When this spell is cast around a camp, it lowers the temperature within the site to that of a mild summer’s day. Alexander uses it, in conjunction with A Time For Slumber, to allow his expedition to rest during the hottest part of the day during desert travel. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''
''Imaginem Spells''

===The False Dune===

''MuIm Level 5 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle Sometimes Alexander can’t just make an unnaturally cool, dark space, surrounded by a moat of scorpions, when he wants to camp. This spell changes the way his camp looks and sounds. He often makes it appear to be a sand dune or copse of trees. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)''
''Mentem Spells''

===Avoiding the Blame===

''MuMe 15 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell allows Alexander to rewrite all of the target’s memories concerning a length of time. Alexander uses this spell to misdirect mundane enemies, but its Duration is so brief that it must be used cautiously. It is suitable for assisting his servants, when in trouble with mundane authorities, to gain their freedom long enough to flee an area. It can also be used to trick rivals into social gaffes, which can harm their political position. (Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)''

===The Petrine Deception===

''MuIm Level 15 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Group This spell makes Alexander’s grogs look and sound like small rocks. Alexander is unable to dispel his magic, and while in rock form his grogs cannot communicate with each other to co-ordinate attacks, so this spell dissipates when Alexander’s concentration wavers. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 Group)''
''Terram Spells''

===Rapid Excavations===

''MuTe(Aq) Level 30 This spell allows Alexander to turn large volumes of sand into water, which rapidly dissipates in the desert heat. Alexander uses this spell to excavate sites that have become sand-bound, and to disorient foes by making the ground they are standing on into a deep waterhole. This spell can affect one hundred cubic yards of sand. Alexander can alter the shape of the space affected with a Finesse Roll. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Part, +1 large target)''
