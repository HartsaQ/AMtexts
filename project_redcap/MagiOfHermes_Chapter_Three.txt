''Concept: This “lab rat” develops effects to order for other magi, to gather resources for her own research project that has yet to bear fruit.''
''Discovered at an early age in a rural village outside Carcassone, Conscientia of Bonisagus was a Hermetic prodigy. Snatched up by a Tytalus at an early age, Conscientia was able to grasp the Hermetic Arts with an amazing speed. Complex formulas were child’s play, yet even the most basic of spells fizzled at her fingertips. With her parens infuriated by her inability to reliably harness the Hermetic forces, Conscientia’s studies were hard and grueling. Eventually she was spotted by a Bonisagus who saw her true potential, and Conscientia was taken back to Durenmar, where her talents could be put to better use. During her training, Conscientia would spend her minute amount of free time in the lab, exploring Hermetic theory in her own ways. She assisted her new master in many high level experiments, the last of which saw a terrible disaster that left the lab destroyed and her parens in Twilight. Although she completed her gauntlet, Conscientia has kept working in that same lab, waiting for her master to return. Conscientia spends her spare time working on requests, developing Lab Texts and casting tablets for barter with other magi for the superior equipment and supplies that she needs to continue her own work. Often, she gives her patron an overly long estimate for an item’s creation, and then announces that she has “finished early” to help bolster her reputation as a miracle worker. Sometimes she instead uses the excess time to continue her own research into the spell her parens was developing (details of which are left to the Storyguide’s discretion).''

''New Spells''
''Conscientia has developed these spells.''
''Animal Spells''

===Doublet of Silk, That’s Impenetrable===

''As Doublet of Impenetrable Silk, but experimentation has resulted in a minor side effect. The clothing affected is changed into actual silk, as well as gaining the normal benefits of the spell.''

===Pests of a Colossal Size===

''MuAn 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group While experimenting with Beast of Outlandish Size, an unforeseen side effect gave birth to this unusual, but peculiarly effective, spell. Pests of a Colossal Size causes the ordinary pests on the target (such as lice, fleas, ticks, etc.) to grow to an enormous size. Being covered in enormous''
''and often hostile insects is disconcerting to say the least, as the pests themselves tend to revert to their basic fight or flight instincts. (Base 4, +2 Sun. +2 Group, +2 Voice)''

===Epona’s Bane===

''ReAn 25 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group Created as a defense against the eastern horseman, Epona’s Bane startles and panics up to a small unit of cavalry horses. The riders of these horses must roll Strength + Ride against an Ease Factor of 12, or be thrown to the ground and risk being trampled. Even those who manage to keep themselves on their mounts must bring their horses back under control before continuing forward. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Group)''

===Summon the Eldritch Bond===

''ReAn 35 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind. A fine preparation to a Wizard’s War, this spell commands a biting insect, such as a mosquito or flea, to bite a specific target and then''
''return. A canny magus can then harvest the blood and its Arcane Connection from the insect. Of course, this needs to be cast fairly close to the target for the insect to have a chance of catching him. However, combining this spell with Pests of a Colossal Size greatly extends its effective range, as well as the intimidation factor. It does rather reduce its subtlety, however; a magus who would ignore a normal mosquito is unlikely to do the same for a giant one. (Base 15, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)''
''Auram Spells''

===Conjure From the Mist===

''MuAu(Te) 40 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Part Developed as an all-purpose utility spell, Conjure From the Mist turns a large section of air into stone, in the shape of the user’s choice. More-complicated shapes require Finesse rolls as normal, but items such as stairs, bridges, walls, spikes and other obstacles are possible. (Base 4, +2 Sun, +1 Part, +2 Voice, +2 size, +1 Intricate)''

===Be Rid the Tell Tale Smoke===

''PeAu 20 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle Conscientia learned this spell from her parens, who developed it after overhearing grogs complaining about a how a campfire’s smoke always gives away their position. This spell simply destroys all smoke within the circle. Great for setting up camp on the sly, or keeping the laboratory smoke-free. (Base 5, +2 Ring, +1 Touch)''
''Corpus Spells''

===Touch of the Blessed Virgin===

''CrCo 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual Conscientia swears this was developed for a friend, and she has never personally found a use for this spell. Popular with fathers, princesses, and nuns alike, this spell restores a woman’s maidenhood and virtue. This is often combined with an Elixir of Morning’s Afterthought for full effect. (Base 15, +1 Touch, Ritual)''
''Charged Items and Potions''
''Often overlooked in Hermetic workings, charged items can be an essential part of a magus’ repertoire. Charged items are unique in their ability to produce large effects where normal enchanted items or spontaneous magic prove too difficult or time consuming to make, and without the cost in vis. Larger effects are far easier to enchant into charged items, so they are a perfect solution if more than a few uses aren’t necessary. They also have the benefit of being produced in large quantities so that they may be given out to multiple individuals. A variety of effects, both small and large in magnitude, can be handed out, enabling those who posses them to deal with situations they might normally be ill-equipped to deal with. Potions are a popular choice for charged items, as they are easily carried and inconspicuous, as well as easily used as a thrown weapon. Carrying the potions around in containers also helps keep down accidental discharges of Touch Range effects. Musical items such as bells and flutes are also popular, as they make excellent choices for effects that need to use Voice Range. Some popular charged items are:''

===Pneum Flask===

''ReAu 5 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind Uncork this small bottle and you can steal the breath of an individual. The breath flows into the flask, which should be immediately corked. If the magus acts fast enough, the stolen breath can then be fixed as an Arcane Connection to the target. (Base 2, +3 sight)''

===Elixir of Morning’s Afterthought===

''CrCo 20 R: Touch , D: Mom, T: Ind, A quick draught of this elixir will wash away even the most serious hangovers. Popular among Jerbiton and Redcaps alike. (Base 15, +1 Touch)''

===Magic Spice===

''MuIm 5 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind''
''Useful while traveling, or in delicate social situations, as a magus can simply pour a bit on even the most appalling food, and taste a delicious feast of his own devising. Adding a bit to the gruel in the soldiers’ mess can make for a significant improvement in the men’s morale. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Ink of the Unseen Circle===

''PeIm 15 R: Per, D: Moon, T: Ind After listening to hordes of magi boasting about their latest “ingenious magical traps,” Conscientia realized they all shared the same common flaw … What idiot is going to willingly step into the creepy magic circle? This specialized ink was the answer. Once activated, the ink becomes invisible for the duration of the effect. When used to draw a Hermetic circle for Ring spells, this ink destroys the iconic species of the ring after activation, leaving it an invisible Hermetic landmine. (Base 4, +3 Moon)''

===Potion of Vulcan’s Appeasement===

''PeIg 20 R: Touch , D: Mom, T: Ind When exposed to open flame, this potion extinguishes a fire up to the size of a large house. Very useful for saving the covenant library from a fiery demise, leaving you valuable time to concoct a proper excuse. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Size)''

===Message in a Bottle===

''CrMe 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Easily carried and completely inconspicuous, a Message in a Bottle is one of the most secure ways to deliver a clandestine message. When this potion is consumed, the drinker has a message of the creator’s design flash through his mind. Very few people would even think to check a vial of liquid for a message, and fewer would be foolish enough to drink an unknown potion just to discover what the suspected message might be. (Base 4, +1 Touch)''

===The Wakeful Nightmare===

''ReMe 20 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind This terrible liquid, if consumed, forbids the body from entering slumber, denying the unfortunate victim his daily rejuvenation. The target stays awake until the duration of the effect ends. Fatigue levels may not be restored, and slowly the sleep deprivation will start to drive the target insane. After every three successive days without rest, the target loses an additional Fatigue level from exhaustion. Once all the target’s Fatigue is lost, she starts taking physical wounds as her body shuts down. Each time the character loses another Fatigue level, she takes 5 + stress die in damage. These wounds cannot heal naturally until the character fully rests. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)''

===Whistle of Warning===

''ReMe 35 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Group A particularly spiteful magus, with just a blow from this whistle, will inflict a group with Visions of the Infernal Terrors until the magus decides to release them from their torment. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +1 Conc, +2 Group)''

===Door in a Bottle===

''PeTe 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Splashed onto a wall, Door in a Bottle dissolves away the stone into an instant exit. Using this potion for illegal purposes is, of course, highly discouraged. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Stone)''

===Disenchanting Concoction===

''PeVi 40 Pen: +30 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This useful potion acts as Winds of Mundane Silence. One of the most utilitarian items a magus can carry with him, it can be used in a variety of ways; it can remove a curse, disenchant a magical trap, or even be thrown on another to drop her Parma. (+1 Touch, +15 Penetration)''
''Magi of Hermes Herbam Spells''

===Statim Sessio===

''CrHe 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T:Ind Favored by magi young and old who just need a quick rest, this spell creates a comfortable wooden chair. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''
''Ignem Spells''

===Evening’s Comfort===

''CrIg 5 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Per After many sleepless nights spent chilled to the bone, enough was enough. Slipping down to the lab to work at night, Conscentia developed this simple spell to keep her warm at night. This spell simply keeps your bed toasty warm until sunrise. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Palm of Odorous Flame===

''The first spell Conscentia developed on her own, this spell works as Palm of Flame, but experimentation has produced a small side effect. Each time the spell is cast, the flame produces the smell of a random odor. Oddly enough, the most common scent produced is elderberry. Needless to say, this spell has proven difficult to trade.''
''Imaginem Spells''

===Veneficus Enigma===

''CrIm 20 R: Touch, D:Conc, T: Ind Developed as a quick game for magi, the Veneficus Enigma creates the illusion of a small puzzlebox in the palm of the caster’s hand that can be manipulated by another. When cast, the caster sets the puzzle for the Veneficus Enigma. The illusory box then produces lights and sounds that are clues on how to open it. Figuring out the puzzle requires an Intelligence + Artes Liberales roll versus an Ease Factor equal to the casters Intelligence + Artes Liberales + 5. Traditionally, the caster holds an item in''
''the palm of his hand when he casts this spell, to be retrieved as the “prize” when the box is opened. Removing the box from the caster’s hands to reveal the item without solving the puzzle is considered extremely impolite. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 Move/ Noise, +1 Intricate)''

===Spy the Approaching Grog===

''InIm 5 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room A touch of a wall allows the caster to peer around the corner without entering the room. Great for sneaking down to the lab or the kitchen without being caught. This spell is designed to be cast forcelessly, as to not accidentally scry on another magus. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Con, +2 Room)''

===Circle of Undisturbed Rest===

''ReIm 5 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle Created in conjunction with Be Rid the Tell Tale Smoke, this large circle spell is meant to be used around an encampment. The circle prevents iconic and echoic species from leaving the circle, making the encampment undetectable. Perfect for ensuring privacy in unfamiliar territories, it does leave the camp as a silent black area; this is normally enough at night, when everything is dark, and Conscientia does not see the need for additional illusions. (Base 1, +2 Ring, +1 Touch, +1 additional sense)''
''Mentem Spells''

===Robed in Angelic Beauty===

''CrMe(Im) 25 R: Voice, D: Con, T: Group This spell creates the image of perfect beauty and a holy aura, instilling a feeling of being near a divine source. This comes in handy when you need the local plebs to believe … well, anything. Conspicuous effects are also more likely to be accepted when the populous thinks of them as miracles rather than spells. However, caution is advised so as not to attract too much attention from the church, or indeed, from demons. Note that all Mythic Europeans know that the devil can masquerade as an angel of light; if a Gifted individual serves as the spokesperson''
''during the effect of this spell, that is almost certainly what the audience will believe. (Base 4, +1 Voice, +1 Con, +2 Group, +1 Imaginem Req.)''

===Thoughts Within Speech===

''InMe 30 R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind Yet another spell where its creation resulted in a side effect worth keeping, this spell acts like Peering Into the Mortal Mind, but while the magus is searching through the thoughts of the target, the target unknowingly speaks those thoughts aloud, going so far as to even weave them into an ongoing conversation. For example: “Did you hear about the new sheriff? Why yes, I was in the gardens last night. I hear he is going to raise taxes this year.” (Base 25, +1 Eye)''

===Apollo’s Fearful Gaze===

''MuMe 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind This horrific spell rewrites the target’s common sense, so that light induces pain signals (Art and Academe, page 33). The brighter the light, the stronger the pain sensed. Note that the pain isn’t caused by any wounds, and will disappear as soon as the spell ends, or when the target is no longer exposed to light.''
''Light Source Penalty Moonlight or Candlelight –1 Torchlight –3 Bonfire –5 Daylight Incapacitated''
''(Base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)''

===Slave of Charity===

''ReMe 35 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell acts as Enslave the Mortal mind, with one exception. The target remains open to all commands as long as the spell remains active. Any time the target hears a new suggestion, he stops what he’s doing and follows the new command, returning to his previous commands when the most recent task is complete. Needless to say this side effect proved quite awkward when discovered. (Base 20, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)''
''Magi of Hermes Terram Spells''

===Conjure the Ocean’s Breath===

''MuTe 15 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Part Developed for the traveling magus who needs a quick, easily tradable resource. Conjure the Ocean’s Breath turns a large patch of dirt into salt. It is best that the magus not be around when the spell’s duration expires. (Base 2, + 3 Moon, + 1 Part, +1 Touch)''

===Armatura Vitrea===

''MuTe 20 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind Designed for those who fear the threat of armor-wearing assailants, Armatura Vitrea transforms one attacker’s armor into glass. The armor now provides a protection of 2, and a load of 3. If struck with a weapon, the glass armor shatters sending razor-sharp shards everywhere, adding an additional simple die to the attack’s damage. This, of course, destroys the armor. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Diam, +2 metal)''

===Foras Vim===

''ReTe 15 R: Voice, D Mom, T: Group An easily fast-cast defense against other magi, this spell shoots a choking cloud of dust and gravel at its targets. Those within the cloud are blinded by the dust and grit, and find it difficult to breathe. Casting a spell while in the cloud requires a Stamina + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 12. This spell also has uses in detecting invisible opponents. Conscientia has been meaning to get around to mastering this spell so that she can fast cast it ever since she created it. Maybe next season ... (Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 Group)''

===Carve Domain===

''PeTe 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part Carve Domain destroys a channel of up to 10,000 cubic feet of earth. This can be used, among other things, as a defensive emplacement, to channel a river, to expand irrigation, or to develop a makeshift moat. A Finesse roll is required for more-complex designs. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +3 Size)''

===Saving the Apprentice’s Time===

''PeTe 10 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Room Realizing she could squeeze in a few more precious moments of lab time, Conscentia decided to “cheat” in her chores. With just a wave of the hand, she can have an hour’s worth of dusting completed in a minute. (Base 3, +1 Touch, + 2 Room)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Conscientia has created these items.''
''Apollo’s Lyre''
''Apollo’s Lyre was originally made to appease Conscientia’s discontented grogs, who kept complaining about the insufferable living conditions in the forgotten depths of a subterranean lab. A small brass lyre, decorated with strips of engraved cinnamon wood, Apollo’s Lyre can play a number of different melodies, songs, or compositions at the caster’s whim. Each string on the lyre, when plucked, plays a different tune. This Lab Text quickly became a popular trade item in Conscientia’s stock.''

===Phantasmal Minstrels===

''CrIm 10 Pen 0, 3/Day R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind Phantasmal Minstrels produces a specific song or melody when activated. The song plays until the magus plucks the same string again, or another string to start a new song. This effect is enchanted multiple times into the lyre, once for each song the magus wishes to hear. Each song is triggered by plucking a different string. Conscientia’s effect requires a single pawn of vis to invest, allowing a greater variety of songs in a single lyre (eight for a wooden lyre, which counts as a large wooden object.) (Base 1, +1 Conc, +1 tune, +2 3/day, +5 item maintains concentration)''
''Cooking Stone''
''This is a small piece of stone with a brass inlay in the shape of a hearth. When it’s placed into a pot of water, the water boils instantly. When the cook is finished, all he needs to do is empty the pot, and retrieve the stone. This item deviates from the Hermetic tradition of overly complex and symbolic names, but occasionally pragmatism has its place.''

===Boil Water===

''CrIg 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen +0, Unlimited/Day This effect boils water on contact. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +10 unlimited uses)''
''Cultellus''
''This small knife with a basalt handle was developed as a trade for some very nice lab equipment. The patron wished a small kitchen knife enchanted with the ability to dispel Parma. Conscientia was halfway through the project before she realized the consequences of what she was making. When confronted, the patron never returned to claim his payment. Conscientia has always claimed to have never finished the project, and to have destroyed what notes she had.''

===Perdo Parma===

''PeVi 37 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen +32, 50/Day When this knife contacts a magus, it will dispel any Parma Magica with a score of 6 or lower (thus providing a Magic Resistance of 30 or lower), as long as it Penetrates. This version relies on the targeted magus being somewhat weak in Vim if his Parma is strong. (Base 10, + 1 Touch, +6 50/day, +16 32 Penetration)''
''Dico Calculus''
''This small stone was created for a blind Criamon who needed an aid in reading. When drawn over a page, the stone “sees” the words on the page and transmits the images into the user’s mind.''

''New Guideline: CrTe 15''
''Repair a crafted item, returning it to an “as new” state.''

|}

===Impart the Words===

''CrMe 26 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Pen +0, Unlimited/Day Transmits the images sensed by the object to the user’s mind. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +5 item maintains concentration, +10 unlimited uses, +3 linked trigger)''

===Read the Words===

''InIm 18 R: Touch, D: Con, T: Ind Pen +0, Unlimited/Day When activated, the object senses the iconic species of whatever it’s touching. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +5 item maintains concentration, +10 unlimited uses)''
''Ferramenta Glacies''
''This inconspicuous item looks like a normal pick, but with a small crystal embedded in the handle. When touched to water, it freezes a block of ice that can be used for trade, storage, or consumption.''

===Touch of Ymir===

''ReAq 14 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen +0, Unlimited/Day Instantly freezes surrounding water into ice. Further applications keep the ice frozen. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +10 unlimited uses)''
''Hermes’ Horn''
''This is an intricately carved ram’s horn with a tiny emerald charm embedded in it, that when blown will cause an entire flock to become passive and easy to control. A user can control a large herd, single-handedly driving them to and from pasture.''

===Herd the Passive Beasts===

''ReAn 40 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group Pen +0, 1/Day This effect calms a herd of animals (up to 1,000 animals), making them far easier to tend, allowing a shepherd or farmer to manage a much larger herd than he could without magical assistance. (Base 4, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +2 Voice, +2 size)''
''Mjolnir’s Equal''
''When the wielder yells a warrior’s call, this hammer can shatter the strongest shield and sunder even steel, crushing weapons, armor, and the poor soul who owns them. No object of metal or wood can withstand the blow of this hammer. This weapon can’t destroy leather armors, but leather armors do little to stop the blow from even a mundane warhammer.''

===Sunder Warrior===

''PeTe(He) 25 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Pen +0, Unlimited/Day Upon activation, a metal or wooden item touching the hammer is utterly destroyed. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Metal, +1 Herbam Req, +10 unlimited uses)''
''Shulpea’s Bowl''
''This small wooden bowl is constantly filled with a non-nutritious food such as flatbread or pretzels. The food is not nourishing, but it helps the determined magus through those long lab sessions and experiments that just can’t be stopped for dinner. This food is also perfect for lab conditions, as it won’t stain, isn’t greasy, any crumbs vanish after a few minutes, and it won’t get all over the magus’ fragile books or equipment.''

===Feed the Hungry===

''CrHe 28 R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Group Pen +3, Unlimited/Day Every two minutes, this bowl fills itself with a specific food (determined when the item is enchanted). When the duration ends, any remaining pieces of food disappear and the bowl refills. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Diam, +2 Group, +1 Size, + 10 unlimited uses, +3 environmental trigger: Diameter)''
''Traveler’s Cloak''
''This handy cloak is a favorite among the Redcaps, as well as grogs who routinely sleep under the stars. When placed upon the ground, the cloak transforms the earth underneath so that it is soft and warm like a mattress. This effect ends at sunrise, assuring a hasty awakening.''

===Transform the Rigid Ground===

''MuTe(Ig) 25 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part Pen +0, 1/Day This effect alters the earth under the cloak, softening it and warming it to the touch. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part, +1 Stone, +1 Ignem Req.)''
''Vessel of Etain’s Children''
''This sinister item is forged as a gold necklace with many fittings. The necklace itself has no power, but the jewel fittings hold a secret. When a drop of blood (easily gathered through Summon the Eldritch Bond) is placed into an empty fitting, it is transmuted into a polished stone within the fitting. This keeps useful Arcane Connections nearby and in an inconspicuous state. As the necklace itself isn’t magical, new fittings can be added as needed.''

===Harden the Eldritch Bond===

''MuAq(Te) 23 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Pen +0, Constant Effect When blood is placed within the enchanted fitting, it’s transformed into an attractive polished stone. This doesn’t alter the blood’s Arcane Connection, which is part of its essential nature and will still last for years. (Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 2/say, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/sunset)''

===Vulcan’s Favored===

''Vulcan’s Favored isn’t so much an item, but an effect that can be placed on items like tools, horseshoes, weapons, or any other commonly used metal object. Often a bronze seal is affixed to the item. The effect keeps it in repair and “like new.” With Vulcan’s Favor, bent tools reshape themselves, worn horseshoes mend, and blades never dull. The items can be traded away, or used by the grogs around the covenant. Weapons with Vulcan’s Favor are sought by paranoid magi who don’t trust their own grogs, as they can’t defeat even the weakest Magic Resistance.''

===Vulcan’s Favor===

''CrTe 29 R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Pen +0, Constant Effect Constantly repairs the enchanted item, extending the item’s life and returning it to usefulness. The item always seems brand new. (Base 15, +2 Sun, +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger: sunrise/sunset)''
