''Concept: Casting his magic through music and illusion, this son of a faerie king searches for his true love despite his father’s interference.''
''Scipio of Merinita was once named Pierre, and is the son of a poor peasant woman and a faerie king of bright summer. Soon after his birth he was abducted and taken to the court of his father, where he learned to use his inherent magical powers to create music and illusions. But he was not alone, because some other very beautiful boys and girls also lived in the court. One of them was a girl named Vinella. Soon the two recognized that there was true love between them. The king was afraid of the love between his son and foster daughter (who he desired, as well) so he sold the boy to a Merinita maga. She turned the boy, who dreamed of becoming a hero to regain his beloved Vinella, into a magus. Soon after his Gauntlet he moved out to the world to find her, always watching for his father’s men who try to lure him away from his quest for his true love.''

''• Scipio is searching for a covenant as a base for his quest; his new sodales could soon be involved in his search. • The players’ characters hear about a strange man who tricked some faeries and even entered the Faerie regio near the covenant. Will he also trick the nearby faeries and make them angry, or will he become an ally with good connections to the fey?''

''• After a long journey, Scipio visits the player characters’ covenant to ask for help getting into a secure regio they know of. There a faerie hides something that might bear hints about Scipio’s''

Will he try to blackmail them, will they hunt him down, or is this just a trick of the faerie king’s men to give Scipio a bad reputation? • On his long journeys, Scipio finds some new vis sources that he will sell to the player characters if they help him in his quest.''

''• Scipio finally finds a way to the tower where Vinella is imprisoned. It is in the Realm of Faerie, guarded by many of the faerie king’s men. He asks the players’ characters if they might help him at least to speak to his father. With Scipio’s guidance they can explore this realm and finally find the tower. • By this time, Scipio has a “personal” Quaesitor who devotes himself to capturing this troublesome magus. • Scipio frees Vinella and has some time to live happily with her, but soon she will be lost again, this time because of a faerie queen who claims to be her mother!''

''• Scipio now seeks to recapture his love from her mother, a faerie queen of dark winter. He searches for an Ignem or ice magus who could help him. • Scipio meddles with the covenant by organizing an alliance between the covenant and a faerie court without asking permission. Will the covenant accept the conditions of the pact? Or will they refuse it and make the faerie court angry?''
''• He seeks someone who could manufacture a ward against iron for him because of his new Vulnerable Magic Flaw. But just when he finds someone, he is also found by the faerie king’s men. Will the characters help him, or deliver him to his enemy?''

===+60 Years===

''• Scipio has to fight not only against the interfering Quaesitors, but also against Vinella’s mother while evading the angry attacks of his father. So he seeks a way to play both sides and escape with Vinella during the war between the two faerie courts. This may ultimately lead to a Wizard’s March against him, if both sides decide to take revenge for their losses and attack other covenants. The player characters may assist Scipio and have to destroy all evidence of their involvement, their covenant might be attacked by the angry faeries, or they might join other members of the Order to hunt down the faerie bard. Whatever the outcome, Scipio and Vinella leave their home Tribunal and travel to some distant place like Scotland, Russia, or the Levant.''

===+75 Years===

''• Finally Scipio and Vinella live together somewhere in a distant country away from urban civilization. They hide with Scipio‘s illusion magic. But sometimes Scipio is filled with wanderlust and he puts on his shoes and walks out the door. He is too careless to think about all the people (two faerie courts and perhaps some Quaesitors) who are still hunting him. Meanwhile, he searches for another apprentice and vis, as well as adventures and young heroes who he can help with their personal quests.''

===+90 Years===

''• Scipio instructs his second apprentice in some of his new silly spells, but the young one uses them to embarrass a mundane lord in front of his men. Scipio seeks out other magi who can deal with this, as he’s afraid solving the problem on his own would bring him to the Quaesitores’ attention. • His Image of the Lady spell becomes highly sought after by many covenants. The players’ covenant still has none, so they’ll need to find this notorious artist to get their hands on some of his useful creations.''

''Felix stepped into this world with an intense urge to wander, visit the humans, and take part in their lives. In the great city of Paris he improved his skill at lying, gambling, and thieving, and  felt as though he was now perfect. But the time away from his Magic aura weakened his powers, and he also attracted some demons who wanted to make him a member of their realm. But luckily Scipio (30 years out of his Gauntlet) found him before he was lured away, saving him from losing more of his powers and becoming Infernal. After this, both traveled to many countries, adventuring and getting into a great deal of trouble that they both survived thanks to their immense luck.''

===Book of Images===

''CrIm 15 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Individual This spell creates moving sounds and images that are stored in a circle (such as a drawn circle on paper) as long as it is intact.

(Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Ring, +1 moving images, +1 intricacy)''

===Told Story===

''CrIm 20 R: Voice, D: Performance, T: Individual Creates the images and sounds of a story sung by the bard, which change along with the story. This spell only creates a small three-dimensional stage on which the story is told, but no true persons. Scipio can sing the story displayed on the stage without losing concentration, because of his Performance Magic (Music) Virtue. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Performance  +2 changing images, +1 intricacy)''

===Cage of Bronze===

''CrIm 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Individual This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a big bronze cage around the target, capturing it''
''(if a targeting Finesse roll succeeds). (Base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)''

===Phantasmal Horse===

''CrIm 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a magical and beautiful riding horse. Due to their faerie nature, such horses are always strangely colored or behave in some other ridiculous way. Scipio’s horses are always red and curious. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 moving parts)''

===Story of Legend===

''CrIm 35 R: Voice, D: Performance, T: Group This spell is similar to Told Story, but instead of creating a small stage as an Individual, this spell can create up to 100 persons or things like clouds, small dragons, and so on. (Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Performance, +2 Group, +1 size, +2 changing images, +1 intricacy)''

===Doppelganger===

''CrIm(Me) 40 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a person’s doppelganger, with some limited freedom and simulated intellect. It may act independently but is under the caster’s control. Like all Glamour spells, the doppelganger has substance and can act as something that really exists. (Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Mentem requisite, +1 copy of someone, +1 moving parts)''

===Image of the Lady===

''CrIm(Me) 40 R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle Similar to Book of Images and the spell The Shadow of Human Life (ArM5, page 144) this spell creates an image of a person, which can also make sounds, within a ring that serves as a frame. This image has limited freedom and a simulated intellect. He or she cannot learn Abilities, but can remember a story told while casting the spell. Such an image can also''
''work as a guard or similar. In Scipio’s home covenant these pictures hang on almost every wall, working as advisors for slow grogs, as monitors in the kitchens, or as sentries. Due to experimentation, Scipio’s version of this spell creates images that need to sleep and eat illusionary meals. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 intricacy, +6 Mentem requisite, for a very elaborate effect)''

===Garden of Eden===

''CrIm 45 R: Voice, D: Concentration, T: Part This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) creates a nearly perfect world around the caster, in which everything is so beautiful that it almost hurts the eye. Most human beings, many animals, and even some faeries lose any desire to fight or argue. While casting, the magus makes a Finesse roll, the result of which is the Ease Factor of a Personality Trait roll to resist this effect. Appropriate Personality Traits would be anger, hatred, violent, and so on. This spell needs to Penetrate to work. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +1 Part, +1 size, +2 extremely beautiful and detailed surroundings)''

===Traveler’s Foresight===

''InIm 5 R: Road, D: Concentration, T: Individual The magus can see and hear the nearest person on the road he is traveling. (Base 2, +2 Road, +1 Concentration)''

===Faerie Flute===

''MuIm 4 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual Enchants a person or a music instrument to make clearer, sharper, and more-melodious sounds. A bard using this instrument often lures faeries to him. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Aura of the Simple Bard===

''MuIm 15 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual Alters the appearance of a person to make him look more innocent and trustworthy. His facial features become softer and more childish. The character receives a +3 on appropri''
''ate rolls. This doesn’t undo the effects of The Gift (see page 75 of ArM5), but works well for magi who have the Gentle Gift. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)''

===Living Fire===

''MuIm 25 R: Voice, D: Fire, T: Individual This spell alters the image, sound, and smell of campfire or bonfire to something the caster chooses, such as a dancing woman or a dragon’s head. The real flame is not changed, so you won’t be burned by the parts of the image that extend outside of it, like the flaming breath of the dragon’s head. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +3 Fire, +1 moving images)''

===Safe Haven===

''MuIm 20 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Structure Changes the image of a building, even one quite extravagant like a small wizard’s tower, to a that of a poor and small hut. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +3 Structure)''

===Ogre’s Stench===

''MuIm 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group You change the targets’ smell (up to 100 people) in such a disgusting and awful way that they and every person near them must make Stamina rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 or act with a –3 penalty to all rolls. If they botch, they throw up. (Base 1, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 size, +2 very “detailed” smell)''

===Blessing the Merchant’s Lineage===

''MuIm35 R: Touch, D: Until (Baptism), T: Bloodline, Ritual This spell changes all members of a bloodline so that they look more trustworthy, their voices are softer if needed, and they seem to be smiling whenever appropriate. This gives the whole bloodline a +3 on rolls that involve gaining trust or convincing others. But if anyone in the bloodline gets baptized the duration ends, so this spell is usually only used by pagans. It uses the Spell''
''Timing mystery (see page 100 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults). (Base 3, +1 Touch, +4 Until, +3 Bloodline)''

===Servant of Fire===

''MuIm(Ig,Me) 45 R: Voice, D: Fire, T: Individual This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) turns a normal fire into a human servant. He has a simple intellect and is good for only simple tasks, but has no possibility of learning or free will. The servant must eat a lot of wood or other flammable materials, otherwise the fire will burn out, ending the spell. As long as the servant eats enough, however, the spell continues. This spell has a minor side effect from experimentation that makes the servant sing instead of speaking normally. (Base 10, +2 Voice, +3 Fire, +1 Mentem requisite, +1 moving parts)''

===Hiding the Ill-bred Bard===

''PeIm 15 R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual Destroys the magus’ image species and makes him invisible except for his shadow. (Base 4, +2 Sun, +1 changing image)''

===Invisible Arms===

''Pe(Cr)Im 25 R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Part The caster’s original arms are made invisible, but the illusion of another pair of arms is created to replace them. If he wishes, the magus may use these fake arms in a normal way while his invisible arms pick pockets or cast a spell. This may require a Concentration roll depending on the fake actions; anything much more complex than swinging them while walking requires a roll. (Base 4, +2 Sun, +1 Part, +1 changing image, +1 Creo requisite)''

===Color Explosion===

''ReIm 15 R: Voice, D: Diameter, T: Individual The image of the spell’s target seems to explode in a great whirlwind of colors and fragments of the original image. The explosion has a radius of two paces for a human with Size 0, changing appropriately for''
''targets of different Sizes. This makes the target effectively invisible as far as combat is concerned, and no visual clues to his precise location can be picked out of the chaos. For rules for fighting an invisible enemy see Houses of Hermes: Societates, pages 32-33. This spell is best used with Discern Own Illusions. (Base 1, +2 Voice, +1 Diameter, +2 fast moving image, +1 change with movements)''
''Mentem Spells''

===The Generous Patron===

''MuMe 15 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Individual This spell changes the common sense (see Art and Academe, page 33) of the target. He cannot estimate the true worth of his belongings and is likely to give more of them for less. (Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)''

===Stolen Moments===

''PeMe 35 R: Eye, D: Concentration, T: Individual This spell removes all active thoughts, memories, and emotions from a person’s mind for as long as the spell lasts, so he cannot think or perceive. During this time the person becomes motionless, and cannot resist if he is moved or attacked; he does not notice anything and cannot remember anything that happens while he is under influence of this spell. (Base 25, +1 Eye, +1 Concentration)''

===Sinister Road===

''ReMe 20 R: Road, D: Moon, T: Individual Someone walking on the road whom the caster can sense is imbued with a bad feeling about what lies before him; he usually turns away from the road and walks back. This spell works similarly to The Shrouded Glen. (Base 3, +2 Road, +3 Moon)''

===Dancing Mania===

''ReMe 30 R: Voice, D: Concentration, T: Individual''
''The target of the spell dances in a wild and ecstatic way for as long as the caster concentrates. The target dances so fast and wildly that he must make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6 every round to avoid losing a Fatigue level. (Base 15, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration)''

===Endless Laughter===

''ReMe 30 R: Voice, D: Concentration, T: Individual The target’s body is shaken by loud, uncontrollable laughter that makes normal breathing or acting nearly impossible. Every round the target must make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6, or lose a Fatigue level. If this spell lasts longer than one hour, the target may suffer from an imbalance of his sanguine humor, causing the symptoms of a disease. (Base 15, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration)''
''Enchanted Items''
''Scipio’s creations include the following.''
''Bottomless Bag''
''A bag made from dragon leather. It is a lesser enchanted device made with experimentation in one season, using 4 pawns of vis in total.''

===Bag Without Bottom===

''MuIm 30 Pen +9, +2/day, constant effect R: Personal D: Sun T: Room The Glamour enchantment (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) inside this bag makes the space inside it far bigger than it should be. More than 200 liters would fit into it, but because the weight isn’t reduced there is still a limit on the wielder. You could put a whole human body inside this bag, if you could bear its weight. If you’re searching for something inside it, you could be forced to crawl into it. (Base 10, +2 Sun, +2 Room; +1 2/day, +3 environmental trigger for total of 34 levels)''
''Talisman: The Eternally Changing Lyre''
''A lyre made from a cinnamon tree, with a magnet and mercury inside a glass stone on the front. 16 pawns were used to open it, 7 for instilling effects. The original lyre was a great work from one of the finest instrument makers in France. It gives the user a +3 on all Music rolls (see City & Guild, page 69).''
''Attunements +4 Imaginem +5 Muto +2 Rego''

===Invisible Musician===

''ReAn 5 Pen +0, 12/day, item maintains concentration R: Personal, D: Concentration, T:  Individual Makes the lyre play music that the user can change by concentrating. (Effect: Base 1, +1 Concentration, +1 complexity; +4 12/day, +5 maintains concentration for a total of 12 levels)''

===Unaging Wood===

''MuHe 5 Pen +0, 2/day constant effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual Makes the lyre hard and flexible like good sheet metal. This gives a small penalty of –1 to music rolls. (Effect: Base 4, +2 Sun; +3 levels environmental trigger, +1 level 2/day, for a total of 14 levels)''

===Dance Horror===

''ReMe 35 Pen +0, 12/day R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Individual Makes the target dance until he has no Fatigue levels or the duration ends. Every round he has to make an Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6, or lose a Fatigue level. (Effect: Base 15, +2 Voice, +2 Sun; +4 12/day, for a total of 39 levels)''
