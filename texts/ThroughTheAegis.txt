<h1>Chapter One Inroduction</h1>


<div sidebars>
<div>Whether it is a brand new foundation freshly hewn from the wilderness or an ancient wreck creaking under centuries of magic, the covenant is the center of most sagas. This supplement for Ars Magica Fifth Edition describes in detail five covenants, their resident magi, and the resources available to them, including vis sources, libraries, and enchanted devices. Each covenant can be used as inspiration for your own saga, as a place to visit, or as the player character covenant. Your player characters can either replace or complement the described residents. Although these covenants have each been strongly integrated into a particular location and Tribunal, all can be used wherever your saga is set. However, your troupe will need to modify the location and Tribunal-specific content accordingly. The characters detailed for the covenants have in some cases been generated seasonby-season, taking into account the character’s duties and the resources available at the covenant. The experience totals of such characters may thus vary slightly from that expected via the Detailed Character Creation method (ArM5, page 32). Life-events such as Twilight may also cause the Virtues and Flaws of some characters to be either unbalanced or to exceed the normal allotment. When this applies it has been noted. When existing communal covenant resources, such as enchanted items, have been acquired or made by the current residents, then these have been effectively paid for twice: once in terms of seasons of work, and once in terms of covenant build points. On the other hand, resources personal to a magus, such as talismans and some enchanted items, have not been paid for out of the covenant build point budget. Generally, if a magus would likely take a resource with him if he left the covenant, it has been considered a personal resource. However, sometimes, it has been necessary to make an arbitrary decision as to whether a particular resource is communal or personal.</div>

<h3>How to Use this Book</h3>

<div>The five covenants detailed in this book make ideal starting points for a new saga. The magi resident in each serve equally well as ready-made player characters already embedded into the fabric of their covenants, or as suggestions to spark entirely new magi in keeping with each covenant. Similarly, the grogs, companions, and other specialists are all either ready-to-play or detailed enough that introducing them is straightforward. You could even take these characters individually and use them in your own saga if you wanted to. The covenant as a character is also well-developed. From Hooks and Boons, to resources, allies, and enemies, and even the state of the covenant’s coffers and the loyalty of its covenfolk, each covenant is already a living, breathing entity all by itself. Each of the covenants is accompanied by a wealth of saga threads and story seeds that your troupe can explore over decades of game time. Some of these challenges are readily apparent while others are more subtle, leaving your troupe free to develop them in any number of ways. Each covenant is also an example of one season in a covenant’s life-cycle, from Spring, through Summer, Autumn, Winter, and back to Spring again. If you are creating your own covenant, then the covenants detailed in this supplement provide solid examples of the situations and challenges that each season brings. For existing sagas, these covenants might be used as fully-detailed background covenants. Each provides information for using them in a range of ways, such as a source of information, political allies or opponents, or even naive young magi to manipulate. Their aims may coincide or cross with those</div>
<div>of your player magi, and finding the right way to deal with them provides challenging stories. As the covenants are well integrated into their different Tribunal settings, they also provide an impetus for magi to visit these different Tribunals, drawing them out of their own covenants and into a much wider Hermetic world. Lastly, the vis sources, enchantments, and books described throughout this supplement can be used as a mine of ideas, or just statistics and book titles, for your own magi and their covenant. Whether you are about to start a new saga or you are approaching the autumn of your current one, the covenants found in this book have something to offer, so populate them, contest them, spy upon them, or straight out raid them: the choice is yours.</div>

<h3>Covenant Seasons</h3>

<div>Covenants are often classified according to their season, which is a complex measure of the age, power, and influence of the covenant. Both players and characters might refer to a covenant’s season and the following gives an indication of its meaning. Of course, this can only be a guide, as the circumstances of each covenant are unique.</div>
<div>Spring</div>
<div>Spring covenants are young settlements, recently built or occupied, that pose many challenges to the magi taking them on. The main characteristics of a Spring covenant are:</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Resources: Spring covenants have few resources, and many of these may be on loan or the personal property of individual magi. The search for new resources is therefore important and remains the focus throughout a Spring covenant’s early years. They may also mistakenly take resources already claimed by others. Generations: The founders of a Spring covenant are almost certainly still alive and living at the covenant and few, if any, apprentices will have been raised there. Familiars may be rare, and many of the original covenfolk are at least still in residence, if not still active as servants, grogs, and specialists. History: A Spring covenant has little history of its own, and stories of other magi and other covenants may dominate. This serves to release the magi from obligations that might be held over those same magi were they to live in more established covenants. A Spring covenant’s history is yet to be written. Stability: Spring covenants are still exploring their boundaries and flexibility is more important than order and structure. Governance is usually consensual as the covenant lives from year to year, and often neither magi nor grogs cling to title or privilege. However, income (vis and mundane) may fluctuate. Connections: A Spring covenant’s main relationships are through the covenant’s individual magi back to their parentes and former covenants. The covenant may have few allies, and their presence may be a concern for more established covenants. On the other hand, a Spring covenant is more likely to encounter mere reflexive resistance to its activities rather than true dedicated, implacable enemies. A Spring covenant is usually simply not important enough for powerful foes to want to destroy it.</div>
<div>Summer</div>
<div>Summer covenants are established settlements, which have usually been continuously inhabited by magi for thirty or more years, though occasionally high levels of resources can help covenants reach this maturity early. After the perils of Spring, Summer marks a period of the covenant’s life where the magi have a secure home, though not all challenges are yet addressed. The main characteristics of a Summer covenant are:</div>
<div>Resources: The covenant has established a claim to enough resources to support the magi, though some resources may still be contested or hard to collect. New magi and apprentices may have access to significant resources in the form of a library and Lab Texts. The established magi may well have developed Talismans, Familiars, or both. Generations: Summer covenants often have a very simple structure, often with the only residents being the founders and their current and former apprentices. As new magi join the covenant, stories about how access to resources and library are distributed and managed arise. The covenant has probably seen apprentices Gauntleted after study here. History: A Summer covenant may have a short but colorful history, with the founder’s personalities still stamped on every aspect of covenant life, even if they themselves have now died or passed in to Final Twilight. Summer covenants often have a defining theme or goal, originating from the founders’ plans, though this may be challenged or replaced by a new generation.</div>
<div>Stability: Summer covenants have established simple routines and customs that govern how things are done, and attempt to regulate life to maximize opportunities for study and research. Covenfolk have grown more used to the Gifted magi who have long been present, and relations with the surrounding population are now established, although stories about problems still arise as unexpected crises challenge the peace. Connections: The covenant will likely have relationships with several other covenants in the Tribunal, both positive and negative, and a growing reputation. They have not yet reached the level of political influence and respect associated with Autumn, but are regarded as more important than a shortlived Spring covenant is.</div>
<div>Autumn</div>
<div>Autumn covenants are mature settlements, which have usually been continuously inhabited by magi for at least a century. If the magi of an Autumn covenant can successfully deal with occasional crises the covenant’s Autumn may last for hundreds of years. On the other hand, either a single catastrophe or the cumulative failure to deal with many seemingly minor problems could push the covenant into Wintery decay. The main characteristics of an Autumn covenant are:</div>
<div>Resources: The covenant should have plenty of established resources. However, some resources may be diminishing or peaking, so some stories may be focused on conservation, finding new sources, or regenerating old sources. Generations: Apprentice, filius, parens, and grand-parens may all live at an Autumn covenant. Thus there could be a wide disparity between the power and interests of the individual magi sitting at the covenant council table. Succession how, whether, and when the senior magi pass power and responsibility down to the younger magi may be an important and contentious issue. Similar issues may apply to the coven-folk. History: Much of an Autumn covenant’s locality, mundane and supernatural, will be shaped by decades or centuries of influence by the covenant itself. Of course, the historic tapestry spread around the covenant probably includes rich threads of compromises, cover-ups, and catastrophes. Inevitably as time passes, some of these plots threaten to unravel. Stability: Autumn covenants have established routines with duties, responsibilities, and the available magical assistance all well understood by the magi, grogs, and the locals that the covenant interacts with. This is an advantage, as it allows the magi to focus on laboratory projects and esoteric mysteries, but it can be a disadvantage if a crisis requires rapid change and innovation. Connections: The covenant probably has numerous relationships with the other covenants of the Tribunal (and quite likely even further afield). Individual exapprentices may be obligated to their parens’ covenant, and an Autumn covenant may have founded colony covenants.</div>
<div>Some connections between the covenant and the rest of the Tribunal may be antagonistic, and the covenant may be enmeshed in a web of political alliances and feuds.</div>
<div>Winter</div>
<div>Winter covenants are mature settlements, which have been continuously inhabited by magi for long times, normally in excess of two centuries. Winter covenants are in decline, and may be approaching catastrophic collapse which the current inhabitants need to prevent, if they can foresee the coming danger! The main characteristics of a Winter covenant are:</div>
<div>Resources: Winter covenants can expect to have considerable resources to their names, but many of these will be damaged, failing, or lost. In particular, auras and vis sources may be on the decline, enchanted devices may be broken, loaned books may not have been returned. While the laboratories of senior magi may be highly-developed, they may be maintained at the cost of other buildings. New sources of vis, covenfolk, and money may be hard to come by. Generations: The precise membership of a Winter covenant may be vague, tenuous, and hard to determine. Elders may have fallen into Twilight, perhaps unknown even to their proxies; masters traveling abroad may settle elsewhere without sending word back to the covenant, and apprentices and younger magi may come and go unnoticed by those elders who remain. Governance is typified by indecision and councils are rarely quorate. It is unlikely that the any of the original founders are alive. History: A Winter covenant is a slave to its history. Old bargains, dark secrets, and near-forgotten obligations are a draw upon the covenant’s energies, and the young pay for the actions of long-lost elders. The ghosts of former inhabitants and mourning familiars may be found within or near the covenant. Beyond the covenant, the world has likely moved on and the covenant is the subject of tale and rumor. Stability: Winter covenants have longestablished traditions: roles, duties, and behaviors that go beyond simple routine, though the decline of the cov</div>
<div>enant members may leave important roles unfilled. The traditions of a Winter covenant are inflexible, and those in authority likely see no convincing reason to change them. Covenfolk may harbor negative feelings towards the magi while at the same time having no means to change their lot. A Winter covenant is not yet dead, but its future is on a knife-edge. Connections: The covenant has numerous lapsed relationships with other covenants, the church, nobility, and hedge traditions. These are most likely to have lapsed through the death of key contacts and increasing political isolation. Relationships with allies are unmaintained, while enemies remain unvanquished. Past apprentices have died or trained apprentices of their own who now feel no connection with their ancestral covenant.</div>
<div>Second Spring</div>
<div>The ruins of a collapsed Winter covenant maybe centuries old are taken over by a new generation of young magi, who try to salvage what they can before all the buildings fall to rubble and the musty tomes decay forever. The main characteristics of a Second Spring covenant are:</div>
<div>Resources: The covenant has lost almost all the resources of the previous generations. The fragments which remain may surpass the resources of a typical Spring covenant but are of failing quality, dangerous to use, or even totally unusable until repaired. The laboratories of departed magi can be difficult to take over if they are over specialized, suffer warping, or otherwise haunted by former residents. Vis and mundane income is minimal due to long neglect, and must be re-cultivated or re-discovered, or new sources must be found. Generations: Few (if any) members of the covenant’s elder generations remain, and any who do hover hazily between the grave and Twilight. Most of the new residents are young, or perhaps elder, wandering magi of the covenant’s lineage who have returned to save (or claim) their ancestral covenant. If the covenant died completely before being resurrected, the current magi may have no connection at all to the earlier residents.</div>
<div>History: The new magi may be held to many of the debts, slights, and enmities of their predecessors, despite being unaware of the precise circumstances under which these were incurred. Problems arise when old rivals and antagonists return, but clever young magi may be able to search ancient texts and interview ghosts to discover hints for overcoming old foes, consolidating old resources, or reestablishing forgotten relationships. Stability: If the covenant is populated with young magi who have ties to the past generations then it may be more stable than if the new magi are all outsiders. However, the world outside the covenant has changed significantly since its original foundation and an inability to cope with such changes may have shattered the original covenant. Restructuring the covenant may be a critical task for the new magi, who have the opportunity to start again, beginning with the covenant’s charter. Connections: Most of the covenant’s alliances and contacts have atrophied through lack of use, but the gravitas of the covenant’s name may still carry some residual influence. The new magi may be able to capitalize on and rebuild these ghostly, tenuous links, or they may prefer to forge new ties.</div>

<h1>Chapter Two The Northern Seas</h1>


<div sidebars>
<div>The Covenant of the Northern Seas is a spring covenant formed from a flotilla of ships that navigate Mythic Europe’s northern seas, charting courses from the Rhine to Hibernia, and Iceland to Iberia. The covenant’s magi are led by a magus of House Tytalus, who brings years of experience at sea and a desire to see his new covenant achieve its full potential. Behind this though, the Tytalus is really after something audacious; the founding of a new Tribunal in the one place nobody has yet thought to look.</div>

<h3>History</h3>

<div>As a Spring covenant, The Northern Seas has little history to speak of beyond the events that led to the covenant’s formation. The rest, of course, is yet to be written. As an apprentice, Carles followed his master from Tribunal to Tribunal and covenant to covenant. His master, Felix, was a specialist in restorative magics and longevity rituals and young Carles witnessed firsthand the fear of elderly magi whose only aim was to prolong their empty lives year after year. He vowed that his life would never descend to that. Upon his gauntlet, he acquired his first ship, La Charytee, having diced with an old sea-captain. Rather than leaving the old man behind, he hired him to captain the ship and to take her to the world’s edge! In the end, those initial years at sea involved nothing so grand and Carles simply sailed the seas, learning what he needed, growing as a magus and a man. When he felt ready for the world’s edge he sailed as far to the west as he could, arriving in faerie land, where he sailed further still. It was there, in a land where every island was an empire, and every man ruled his own kingdom, that he realized what he wanted; his own Tribunal. His</div>
<div>experiences had given him inspiration, but his journeys had shown him where to build it; on the ocean itself. He encountered the Bjornaer Hilde Oddfish as Hilde was seeking out her ancestor in order to explore her inner heartbeast and the two struck up a firm and lasting friendship. With Hilde confined to the sea for half her life, Carles’ notion of a Tribunal of the oceans struck a chord. The magi acquired a second vessel, the Marie de Bayonne, for Hilde and they started exploring together, finding that the ocean was magically far richer than any had previously assumed. The last decade has been spent in acquiring enough funds to purchase four other ships to complete their covenant. Leaving this fleet in Hilde’ care, Carles traveled widely looking for disaffected young apprentices and magi that he could tempt. He attended as many Tribunals as he could in recent years and he was successful four times over and one by one the covenant grew. Depending on when you start, the magi have either just started sailing together or</div>
<div>are about to start their maiden voyage as a covenant. Until this point, the covenant’s time has been taken up with outfitting each ship with the essential laboratory. And now, the open ocean awaits.</div>

<h3>Boons & Hooks</h3>

<div>The covenant is described through the following Boons and Hooks, details of which can be found in the Covenants supplement: Mystical Allies (Major Surroundings Boon): Merfolk are more than just stories that old sailors tell for the price of an ale. They have their kingdoms beneath the sea, they have their princes and their rogues, and so long as the covenant of the Northern Seas treats them well, they make potent allies. Criminals (Minor Residents Boon): Whether on land or on sea, the covenant can call upon men willing to risk punishment under law on the covenant’s behalf. Difficult Access (Minor Site Boon): Knowing where the covenant is going to be makes for a good start, but those intent on visiting must have means to travel to the ships on the open seas. Famous Resident (Minor Resident Boon): Carles Magnus has built a reputation for himself and his bold idea of a sea-borne covenant. As a result, most covenants surrounding the northern seas have heard of him. His name carries influence either as an inspiration to magi with pretensions to forge their own path, or as a figure of scandal. Healthy Feature (Minor Site Boon): The open seas and the clean air, free from corruption, are excellent for the humors. At the expense of weathering storms and wintering in safe harbors, the magi and covenfolk are generally fitter and healthier than their landlocked counterparts.</div>
<div>Tribunal: Normandy Year Founded: 1209 Season: Spring Symbol: A Cog at Full Sail</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Informants (Minor External Boon): The misfits of the Northern Seas may be the black sheep of their former covenants, but they still have their contacts. Some of the younger magi grew up alongside others still learning their Arts who are eager for stories of the high seas. This means the covenant receives word of the interests of important magi and covenants, which may help the covenant in trade. Local Ally (Minor External Boon): A prominent tax collector at Barfleur, nominally the covenant’s home port, is a strong ally to the covenant. He is a member of the town’s Jewish community and owes much to the covenant’s elder magi for help and protection they afforded him and his family some years ago. Further information is provided below. Ungoverned (Minor External Boon): No ruler can truly lay claim to the seas, although the trade alliances and mercantile families probably try. As a result, the magi of the Northern Seas govern themselves and, ports and harbors aside, can afford to be a law unto themselves. Sailors (Residents Free Choice): The covenfolk are virtually all sailors.</div>
<div>Missing Aura (Major Site Hook): A covenant at sea cannot expect to sail within a magical aura all year. There are auras out there, but they are small and widely distributed. As a result, the covenant has a base magical aura of zero. Tribunal Border (Major External Hook): While nominally in the Normandy Tribunal, the independent covenant of the Northern Seas sails the borderlands between multiple Tribunals. The covenant’s connection to Normandy is tenuous at best and its magi enjoy a freedom not often granted to others. As the covenant proves the sea’s worth, multiple Tribunals may try to tempt them into membership. However, when those approaches are rebuffed, proud Tribunals may decide to take action against the upstart covenant. Erratically Mobile (Minor Site Hook): Not only do the ships of the Northern Seas sail where they will, but they may not always sail together. This means that finding the covenant and/or specific members can be difficult. The covenant does have allies on dry land, but their visits may not be regular. Gender Imbalance (Minor Residents Hook): Many sailors agree that a ship is</div>
<div>no place for a woman. As a result, and despite the covenant playing home to a female captain, the ships’ crews are overwhelmingly male. Others may view the covenant as somewhat aggressive and there is little chance for family life within the covenant. Possession Victim (Minor Residents Hook): As the covenant lacks an Aegis, the ships rely on relics or on Hermetic spells to protect the ship and crew from the infernal. Despite this, there is an infernal presence on board one of the ships and the demon is playing the long game of influencing the crew and the magus to sin and damnation. One or more of the crew are possessed by a demon. Carles Magnus suspects that something infernal may be trying to influence his crew but does not know of the possession directly. See below for more details. Poverty (Minor Resource Hook): The covenant is young, with few resources. It has the Minor variant of the Poverty Hook and starts with a single Lesser Income Source, providing 40 Mythic Pounds per year. The magi may need to resolve that early on as the covenant currently runs a deficit.</div>

He is also an accomplished thief, something he learned in the service of yet another master. Ojo’s Animal Qualities are described in terms of the rules in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 40. Necessary skill modifiers are summarized here for ease of reference. The magical Qualities and Inferiorities are all as described in Realms of Power: Magic.

He can acquire any mundane Qualities, like a pair of goat’s horns, a tortoise’s shell, a hedgehog’s spines, the venomous fangs of a snake, or the thick pelt of a bear; but cannot make major adaptations like a bird’s wings or the ability to breathe water like a fish. He can only retain one such ability at a time; if he adopts an ability while he still retains another, then the first ability disappears. The power is otherwise maintained indefinitely, but all the time that the monkey retains an ability he loses one Might point every sunset and sunrise (it takes him three hours to regenerate this point; quicker in a Magic aura). MuAn 25 (base 4, +2 Sun, +1 Part, +1 Constant effect, +1 can change ability possessed) Personal Power (25 levels, –2 Might cost) Mimic the Man, 0 points, Init +2, Imaginem: the monkey can perfectly copy any sound he hears, even human speech.

This power has unlimited use. Appearance: Ojo is a Barbary macaque, a tailless monkey with yellowish, gray, or brown fur with paler underparts, and a dark pink face. His hands and feet are nimble and dextrous, perfect for climbing and thieving. He wears trousers and a jacket of eastern silk.</div>
<div>Ojo’s silver cord adds to Carles’ concentration rolls to hold his magic addiction at bay. Talisman</div>
<div>Carles’ talisman is a kilij, a single–edged sword with curved iron blade. It is of Turkish origin and is adorned with Islamic designs with a golden hilt containing an embedded topaz. The talisman has been opened for enchantment with 14 pawns of vis and contains the following effects: Waves of Drowning and Smashing ReAq 30 Pen +0, 1/day R: Sight, D: Momentary, T: Individual As per the spell of the same name in ArM5, page 124. (Effect: Base 10, +3 Sight, +1 size) Wizard’s Leap ReCo (Animal, Herbam, Terram) 18 Pen +0, 6/day R: Personal, D: Momentary, T: Individual The caster is instantly transported up to 50 paces in any direction, provided he can see his destination or has an Arcane Connection to it. His Talisman and any equipment associated with the forms of Animal, Herbam, and Terram comes with him. Otherwise, as per the description in Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 36. (Effect: Base 15; Modifications: +3 for 6/day) The Wound that Weeps PeCo 30 Pen +24, 6/day R: Voice, D Momentary, T: Individual As the spell described in ArM5, page 133.

This effect is triggered in combat, when it strikes an opponent’s metal weapon or armor. If the effect penetrates, it rusts the target through and weapons become little more than bludgeons and armor drops to the next protection value as per the table in ArM5, page 176. (Effect: Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 metal; Modifications: +3 for 6/day, +12 for +24 Penetration) The laboratory texts for effects enchanted into this talisman have not been translated and are not available to the covenant.

<h3>Through The Aegis Magi</h3>

<div>Six magi sail the Northern Seas, two of which are experienced and represent the driving forces behind the covenant, while the remaining four are young and starting out in their magical careers. These four younger magi make for good player characters as none have taken familiars, enchanted talismans, or significantly modified their laboratories, leaving players with scope in those areas.</div>
<div>Carles Magnus of House Tytlaus</div>
<div>Carles grew up hearing tales of Hermetic daring, of magi pushing against the limits of magic, each other, and the natural order of the world itself. His master was itinerant, however, and his apprenticeship was spent traveling between Tribunals, but it was at sea that he was happiest. Something about it suited his magic and temperament and he eventually earned great wealth through pragmatic piracy and acquiring things for other magi that they could never get for themselves. This has given him something of a reputation, not always for the good. Carles has ambitions to found his own Tribunal of the Northern Seas, with himself</div>
<div>as its Praeco. Through the last forty years, he has developed a daring plan and his flotilla covenant is the first stage. His Tribunal will encompass all the waters between the shores of Hibernia, Stonehenge, Loch Leaglean, the Rhine, Normandy, and Provençal, and all the lands beneath the seas, and the sky above. Giving the covenant members a degree of freedom is part of his strategy. He intends them to gain their own followers, larger or more numerous ships, to control shipping lanes, etc. In essence, he wants them to outgrow his covenant and leave to found their own.</div>
<div>Hilde Oddfish of House Bjornaer</div>
<div>Hilde Oddfish has a problem. Her shark Heartbeast rages so fiercely that the only place she feels safe is at sea. It is not just her own safety that concerns her. The giant’s blood running through her veins, the berserk fury that seethes behind her eyes, and the lack of control she has over her magic combine to make Hilde an unpredictable woman to be around. She knows this and holds it all back as far as she can, but cannot ultimately fight what she is.</div>

<div>Heartbeast Statistics</div>
<div>Using the rules in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 23, Hilde, in the shape of her shark Heartbeast, has stats as listed below. They include all modifiers for the House Bjornaer Inner Hearbeast (Epitome) Mystery Virtue. Any relevant Virtues and Flaws from human form still apply in animal shape, Social Status is irrelevant. No General Abilities from human form are usable except language and lores, but Arcane, Academic, and Supernatural Abilities are still accessible. In animal form she uses the General Abilities inherent to that beast at their fixed levels, although she may practice if she stays in animal form for an entire</div>
<div>season, or spend experience gained on adventures while in animal form.</div>
<div>Characteristics (Outer Heartbeast): Int +1, Per –2, Pre –3/+3, Com –6, Str +7, Sta 0, Dex +2, Qik +1 Characteristics (Inner Heartbeast): Int +1, Per –2, Pre –3/+3, Com –6, Str +10, Sta 0, Dex +2, Qik +1 Size: +3 Confidence: 1 (3) Virtues & Flaws: Berserk, Lightening Reflexes; Ferocity (hunting), Fury (blood in the water), Greedy, Tough Qualities: Aggressive, Ambush Predator, Aquatic, Large Teeth, Loathsome Appearance Personality Traits: Brave +3, Greedy +3, Cruel +2 Reputations: Deadly (mariners) 2 Combat: Large Teeth (Outer Heartbeast): Init +0, Atk +11, Def +6, Dam +10 Large Teeth (Inner Heartbeast): Init +0, Atk +11, Def +6, Dam +13 Soak: +2 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0/0, –1/–1, –3/–3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–8), –3 (9–16), –5 (17–24), Incapacitated (25–32), Dead (33+) Abilities: Artes Liberales 3 (ritual magic), Awareness 2 (food), Bjornaer Lore 5 (modifying initiation scripts), Brawl 5 (Large Teeth), Code of Hermes 3 (tribunal procedures), Faerie Lore 2 (faeries of the sea), Finesse 3 (casting speed), French 4 (slang), German 5 (slang), Heartbeast 6 (regain human form), Hunt 4 (prey), Latin 5 (hermetic usage), Magic Lore 3 (giants), Magic Theory 6 (inventing spells), Order of Hermes Lore 2 (personalities), Parma Magica 5 (Animal), Penetration 5 (Corpus), Philosophiae 3 (ritual magic), Stealth 4 (stalking prey), Survival 3 (home terrain), Swim 5 (home terrain) Appearance: The heartbeast is a noticeably large shark with scarred and pitted grey skin and a wide gaping mouth filled with jagged teeth. Mythic Feat: At the cost of 1 Confidence Point, the Inner Heartbeast may inflict a Heavy Wound on any creature of size +1 or less on a successful attack. The shark is an unattractive beast, hence its low Presence score. However, its Loathsome Appearance Quality makes it fearsome and its Presence is treated as +3 for the purposes of intimidation. If using City & Guild, attacks by her Inner Heartbeast are sufficient to cause ships to make damage rolls.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Sharks are solitary creatures and Hilde’s one concession to humanity is her loyalty to Carles and she most often sails close to him. Carles may, however, send Hilde to accompany one of the other magi if he suspects anything untoward or underhanded, banking on Hilde’s presence to be enough to bring wayward youngsters into line. A member of Clan Maruhs, Hilde lives the life of a wanderer. Rebellious even to her clan, she has turned her back on their traditional magical leanings, distancing herself from them. She has no sept as the solitary aspect of her shark heartbeast asserts itself. See Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults for more on House Bjornaer clans and septs. Hilde sought out her Bjornaer ancestor several years ago and initiated one of the Inner Mysteries of her House that further enhances her heartbeast. She still retains the scarring on her side, in both human and shark form, caused by her first encounter with that ancient and powerful shark.</div>
<div>Columba of Ex Miscellanea</div>
<div>Columba served her apprenticeship in House Guernicus, but even in the earliest years of her apprenticeship, she knew that a life in that House was not what she wanted. It was during the year before her Gauntlet that she met Carles Magnus and she saw in him an opportunity for freedom. They agreed that Carles would find her a sponsor within House Ex Miscellanea and the day before she was due to take her Gauntlet examination, she fled her covenant to Carles’ ship on the coast and they sailed for Stonehenge, where she was accepted into House Ex Miscellanea by Benedic of Oxeney. From there, they sailed south to Iberia where she stayed for several years before returning to Carles, bringing a book with her. This polemic on the founding of a new Tribunal draws upon her own study of the code and upon Carles’ grand scheme, supporting her own ambition to found a new Tribunal. The cross-House and cross-Tribunal nature of Columba’s flight meant that no charges of deprivation of magical power were brought, but her former parens has never forgiven the insult. Columba has the Tormenting Master Flaw and fate conspires to place Columba and her former Guernicus parens, Roman de Troyes, in the same place at the same time rather more frequently than chance alone would dictate.</div>
<div>Matilda Page of House Verditius</div>
<div>Matilda Page was born and schooled in the Stonehenge Tribunal and, perhaps unwisely, her master allowed her to maintain contact with her birth family. This resulted in Matilda’s wealthy, but troublesome, parents, siblings, and cousins arriving at her master’s door on more than one occasion. This is perhaps why Matilda was so keen to run away to sea. Matilda’s interest was piqued by Carles’ tales of a wreck of a knarr laying on the seabed. This old viking ship, covered in magical runes as used by the wizards of the icy north, is now a source of vis. To Matilda, the wreck represents not just a source of vis, but also inspiration to pursue the Elder Verditius Runes and beyond. She believes the runes themselves to be magical, the true source of the vis. Her own craft is as an illuminator and her devices are always etched, engraved, or otherwise decorated with perfectlyformed script or images. She is particularly fond of charged devices and any potions or salves that she creates look and taste suspiciously like ink.</div>
<div>She is keen to learn the mystery of Enchant Casting Tools (Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 123) once her Arts have improved as she believes this to be a means of enhancing her magical power quickly and efficiently. Jealous of the Rusticani ex Miscellanea tradition, who are able to craft charged items without spending a whole season on the exercise, she one day intends to integrate, research, or initiate her own version of the Rusticani Craft Magic Virtue (as described in Houses of Hermes, Societates, page 130). Mindful that others of her House might see this as a betrayal of their crafts and mysteries, she has not shared this information with any other Verditius.</div>
<div>Tibor Milos of House Tremere</div>
<div>As Carles Magnus began to make a name for himself, a clerk within House Tremere started to question just what the Tytalus magus was doing. He seemed to put into port but rarely and had distanced himself from the politics and contests of his native Normandy Tribunal. The clerk went to his superiors with an outlandish suggestion; Carles Magnus was laying the foundation for a new</div>

No matter how careful she is, blotches of ink usually find their way to the corner of her mouth, her chin, and her earlobe, which she has a habit of clutching when deep in thought. Casting Sigil: A tide of illusory black ink wells from her fingers and up her arms. The greater the magnitude of the spell, the further the ink reaches.

<div>Devices</div>
<div>Matilda has a penchant for charged devices, particularly scrolls that she can either use herself without going to the trouble of spell-casting or to give to grogs and let them sort themselves out. She has developed the following scrolls, for which she retains the laboratory texts:</div>
<div>3 scrolls of Bind Wounds (as per ArM5, page 129), CrCo 10 (+0 penetration) 1 scroll of Pilum of Fire (as per ArM5, page 140), CrIg 20 (+20 penetration) 1 scrolls of Circular Ward Against Demons (as per ArM5, page 162), ReVi 15 (+20 penetration) 2 scrolls of Wreaths Of Foul Smoke (as per ArM5, page 125) CrAu 10 (+0 penetration) These are activated by opening them and speaking the illuminated trigger word or phrase written upon the scroll in Latin. Matilda has not yet developed a talisman, considering it perhaps too early in her career to settle on any one device.</div>

<div>Equipment: A satchel containing crumbled and torn parchments, small horn cups, a bottle of wine, a blunt pen knife, and never enough ink or quills. Encumbrance: 0 (0) Appearance: Handsome, smiling, fair, and with a good voice. Casting Sigil: His sigil is simply a sparkling golden sheen that persists through the casting, but it seems to apply randomly to the caster, the target, a nearby object, or a third party Voting Sigil: A cup made of polished horn with a silver rim. Spells Known: The Severed Limb Made Whole (CrCo 25) +18 Physician’s Eye (InCo 5) +10 Eyes of the Cat (MuCo(An) 5) +3 Disguise of the New Visage (MuCo 15) +12 Preternatural Growth and Shrinking (MuCo 15) +12 The Gift of Vigor (ReCo 20) +16 Spasms of the Uncontrolled Hand (ReCo 5) +8 ** Wizard’s Leap (ReCo 15) +16 Palm of Flame (CrIg 5) +6 Words of the Unbroken Silence (CrMe 10) +4 ** **	 Penalty for Short Ranged Magic applied.</div>
<div>Creating Poetry</div>
<div>You can find more detail in the Art & Academe supplement, but here is a brief summary of the rules needed for Andrew to create new works of poetry. Unlike study sources, poems generate an Aesthetic Quality instead of a Source Quality. This is determined as follows:</div>
<div>Aesthetic Quality: Communication + Craft: Poetry + bonuses</div>
<div>The bonuses include (but are not limited to):</div>
<div>• Virtues like Inspirational and Free Expression add a +3 bonus. • An artist can double the time it takes to create a piece of artwork and receive a +1 bonus. • An artist can work overtime, taxing his physical and mental resources throughout the course of the artwork’s creation. He receives a +1 bonus, but must make an Aging roll as soon as the artwork is completed. • An artist can add one third of his Artes Liberales score (rounded up) to a piece of artwork that somehow incorporates knowledge of one of the liberal arts.</div>
<div>The poet determines their story, and the troupe determines which standard Abilities this covers. Area Lore, Magic Lore, Faerie Lore, Order of Hermes Lore, etc. are all valid subjects that a poem written by a Hermetic magus might touch upon. A new work of poetry typically takes at least one season to create. The actual length of time taken is one season multiplied by the Aesthetic Quality / 10, rounded up. Artists use this work as a study source for the associated artistic Ability with a source quality equal to the work’s Aesthetic Quality divided by 2. Others may read the poem and gain exposure experience (two experience points) in any of the Abilities that the work involves. Chapter Eight of Art & Academe provides more details and options to support Andrew’s artistic ambitions.</div>

<h3>Tibor Milos (Cont’d)</h3>

<div>Tibor’s Wolf Form</div>
<div>Characteristics: Cun +2, Per 0, Pre +1, Com 0, Str –1, Sta +3, Dex +2, Qik +2 Size: –1 Confidence Score: 1 (3) Virtues & Flaws: Ferocity (against livestock), Improved Characteristics x2, Long-Winded; Compulsion (killing), Infamous Qualities: Aggressive, Hardy, Keen Sense of Smell, Pack Animal/Pack Leader, Pursuit Predator, Sharp</div>
<div>Ears, Thick Fur, Vocal (choleric) Personality Traits: Brave when hunting or cornered +3, Cowardly when surprised +2 Reputations: Bloodthirsty (local) 4 Combat: Teeth: Init +2, Attack +11, Defense +9, Damage 0 Claws: Init +1, Attack +9, Defense +10, Damage +1 Soak: +7 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0/0, –1/–1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–4), –3 (5–8), –5 (9– 12), Incapacitated (13–16), Dead (17+)</div>
<div>Abilities: Athletics 5 (distance running), Awareness 3 (smell), Brawl 5 (teeth), Hunt 4 (track by smell) Appearance: Erect, triangular ears, a narrow muzzle, and a coat of shaggy pale grey fur. His eyes are yellowish and they have a steady, unsettling gaze.</div>

<div>Tribunal. Of course, the notion was incredible – there was no land to claim, no kingdoms by which to mark a border, and any auras would be transient at best. The clerk received short shrift and, as far as Coeris was concerned, the matter was closed. However, the clerk had a filius who had just taken his Gauntlet. This Tibor Milos was assigned by his parens to the Covenant of the Northern Seas to act as House Tremere’s eyes and ears within what could be a unique political situation. Tibor is a man with two problems. Firstly, he is beholden to his parens and must report back on the covenant’s activities. Secondly, he carries the curse of lycanthropy. When the moon is full, he turns body and mind into a savage wolf. However, he is prepared and he has brought his companion, Laszlo, who is also his translator, who oversees his confinement on the appropriate nights. Laszlo is described below. At present, Tibor must send communications back to his parens by mundane means, such as using merchant houses or redcaps to transport messages. In time, he intends to invent or acquire a magical means of achieving the same. Despite herself, Hilde is intrigued by Tibor’s lycanthropy, although this is in much</div>
<div>the same way a shark is intrigued by something strange bobbing about in the water.</div>
<div>Andrew of Jerbiton</div>
<div>Andrew is a dreamer in search of adventure, but adventure in which his companions confront the dangers that he can then record. That’s not to say that Andrew is a coward, far from it. He simply has a welldeveloped sense of his role and that role is to facilitate the efforts of others, to inspire them to great deeds and to record them for posterity. There is no better place to do this than on the Northern Seas with what to him is a band of heroic adventurers. Andrew finds magic harder when not touching his target, but he has control over his spells such that he can vary the Range, Duration, or Target up or down by one magnitude, and he uses these spells principally to assist his companions. This is Andrew’s modus operandi; facilitating others so that he may support and, importantly, observe. As helpful as he is, he is often unprepared for the basics. His satchel contains many things that might once have served a purpose or might spark a conversation, but almost never contains what he needs. Luckily, he has no difficulty imposing upon</div>
<div>the generosity of others. He has a passion for poetry and intends to record his adventures in the form of chansons de gesta, epic poems concerning heroic deeds, as described in Art & Academe, page 117. These typically take a season to create and a summary of the rules is provided below. Andrew knows Matilda from their shared background in Stonehenge and he quite likes the strange bookish woman. In fact, he’d quite like to see if Matilda’s magic can help improve his own poetry in the way that magically refining books improves them as a study source.</div>

<h3>Notable Covenfolk</h3>

<div>Like other covenants, the Northern Seas has its share of companions and grogs and like other covenants not all of these characters live or travel with the magi.</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Otto-Pauels</h3>

<div>Characteristics: Int +2 (1), Per 0, Pre 0, Com +2 (1), Str 0, Sta 0, Dex +1 (1), Qik 0 Size: 0 Age: 47 (47) Decrepitude: 0 (3) Warping Score: 2 (11) Confidence: 1 (3) Virtues and Flaws: Clerk; Arcane Lore, Relic, Warrior, Well-Traveled; Diabolic Past; Arthritis, Weakness (Adventure) Personality Traits: Steadfast +3, Cynical +2, Compassionate +1 Combat: Dodge: Init –1, Attack n/a, Defense +3, Damage n/a Fist: Init –1, Attack +3, Defense +2, Damage +0 Kick: Init –2, Attack +3, Defense +1, Damage +3 Long sword: Init +0, Attack +10, Defense +6, Damage +6 Soak: +2 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+) Abilities: Area Lore: Flanders 2 (legends), Artes Liberales 3 (logic), Athletics 3 (climbing),</div>
<div>Awareness 2 (searching), Brawl 2 (Dodge), Charm 2 (being witty), Chirurgy 2 (binding wounds), Church Lore 2 (rites), Civil and Canon Law 2 (as applied to Flanders), Organization Lore: Covenant of the Northern Seas 1 (personalities), Dominion Lore 3 (angels), English 3 (prose), Faerie Lore 3 (faeries of death), Low German 5 (Flemish), Folk Ken 4 (clergy), French 3 (prose), Greek 3 (religious texts), Hebrew 3 (religious texts), Infernal Lore 6 (undead), Latin 5 (academic usage), Leadership 3 (inspiration), Magic Lore 4 (creatures), Order of Hermes Lore 1 (personalities), Philosophiae 4 (natural philosophy), Single Weapon 4 (Sword, Long), Theology 3 (heresy) Equipment: Partial Metal Reinforced Leather Armor, tinder box, clerk’s robes, longsword, satchel with basic writing tools. Encumbrance: 2 (2) Vis: Otto often carries a Fennel of Virtue containing 2 pawns of Vim vis, and a Clach Crubain of Virtue containing 1 pawn of Perdo vis. He also holds five pawns of Divine Perdo vis, as described later in this chapter. Appearance: Otto is rugged and tanned despite his apparent vocation as a clerk. He has an easy smile and a resolute brow and</div>
<div>his still-thick hair is turning from brown to gray. When at home, he wears robes appropriate to a clerk and keeps his armor, traveling clothes, and weapons upstairs in his chamber.</div>
<div>The objects of virtue and the vis listed above are bought with the covenant’s Build Points; 5 Build Points for each of the enriched items and 1 Build Point for the 5 pawns of Divine Perdo vis. Any creature with an Infernal Might of 25 or less struck with the Fennel of Virtue lose 5 points of Infernal Might (Penetration +35) at the cost of one of Otto’s Fatigue Levels. In carrying the Clach Crubain close to him, Otto gains the Lesser Immunity (Arthritis) Minor Supernatural Virtue, but gains warping through being under a constant magical effect. These are described in more detail in Realms of Power: Magic, pages 126 and 127. Otto’s personal library includes four books upon the subject of the supernatural realms. These are available to the covenant, although he has the only copies and does not allow them to leave his premises. Otto lives with his housekeeper, the young widow Madamoiselle Katarine Tempête, who occasionally assists him on his adventures.</div>

<h3>Through The Aegis Companions</h3>

<div>The covenant has few companions as such but the characters described below fill those roles. Where the Northern Seas is adopted as a player covenant, these companions would make ideal player characters.</div>

<h3>Dolly Price</h3>

<div>The port of Southampton on Stonehenge’s south coast is a busy place and sea captains vie with the king’s men to avoid taxes on goods in and out of the country. One woman happily plays one side against the other and makes profit of it; Dolly Price. While she has sailed with Carles in the past, she sees her place as firmly on dry land, running her dockside lodging house known locally as the Inn on the Wharf. It is a place where hard men of the sea come for comfort and the wealthy come to escape the city’s watchful eye. The Inn is sometimes violent, but slight as she is Dolly is more than a match for trouble.</div>
<div>An ally to the covenant, Dolly is socially connected with a network of agents along the coast and beyond who feed information back to her. She has enemies within the king’s men, enemies that might well close her down but for the protection she enjoys from Carles. She also has the touch of magic about her and her Entrancement power helps her to get what she wants from those she encounters.</div>
<div>Otto-Pauels</div>
<div>Otto is an adventurer at heart. Despite his years and the occasional attack of arthritis, he is still fit, and as much as he tells himself that his impetuous days are behind him, adventure always conspires to lure him out for one last job. He is a learned man and has applied this learning to matters of the unseen world. Outside of the Order, Carles knows of few men who know as much of the four realms as Otto does, especially when it comes to the undead.</div>

<h3>Dolly Price</h3>

<div>Characteristics: Int +2, Per 0, Pre +3, Com 0, Str –1, Sta –1, Dex 0, Qik 0 Size: –1 Age: 30 (30) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Confidence: 1 (3) Virtues and Flaws: Merchant; Entrancement, Wealthy; Protection (Carles Magnus), Temporal Influence (coastal criminals and smugglers); Enemies (Sheriff of Southampton), Greater Malediction (Plagued by Infernal Entities); Busybody, Small Frame Personality Traits: Gregarious +3, Unforgiving +2, Determined +1 Reputations: Stay on the right side of Dolly Price 3 (thieves and rogues), A thief and a rogue 3 (sheriff of Southampton) Combat: Dodge: Init +0, Attack n/a, Defense +2, Damage n/a Fist: Init +0, Attack +2, Defense +2, Damage –1 Kick: Init –1, Attack +2, Defense +1, Damage +2 Bludgeon: Init –1, Attack +4, Defense +2, Damage +1 Dagger: Init +0, Attack +5, Defense +3, Damage +2 Throwing Knife: Init +0, Attack +5, Defense +4, Damage +1 Soak: –1 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious</div>
<div>Wound Penalties: –1 (1–4), –3 (5–8), –5 (9–12), Incapacitated (13–16), Dead (17+) Abilities: Area Lore: Southampton 4 (personalities), Athletics 2 (running), Awareness 3 (alertness), Bargain 2 (hard sell), Brawl 2 (Dagger), Carouse 4 (power drinking), Organization Lore: Covenant of the Northern Seas 1 (personalities), Disguise 2 (peasants), English 5 (slang), Entrancement 5 (questionable commands), Folk Ken 3 (the opposite sex), French 4 (slang), Guile 3 (lying to authority), Intrigue 3 (rumormongering), Leadership 4 (intimidation), Legerdemain 1 (picking pockets), Order of Hermes Lore 1 (personalities), Tavern/Brothel Owner 4 (exotic girls), Thrown Weapon 3 (throwing knife) Equipment: Encumbrance: 1 (1) Appearance: Dolly is a short woman with cascading dark locks, a broad mouth, and large bright eyes.</div>
<div>The inn is within an Infernal aura that enfolds places where drinking, gambling, and debauchery are indulged. This is level 1 during the day, but rises to level 2 at night. This accounts for the many minor infernal influences that surround her. Unfortunately for her, Dolly’s soul is probably thrice-damned already, what with all the men she’s robbed, killed, or otherwise wronged.</div>

<h3>Laszlo</h3>

<div>Characteristics: Int 0, Per 0, Pre 0, Com 0, Str 0, Sta +1, Dex +2, Qik +2 Size: 0 Age: 30 (30) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Confidence: 1 (3) Virtues and Flaws: Custos; Animal Ken, Second Sight; Warrior, WellTraveled; Unbaptized*; Nocturnal, Tainted With Evil * Realms of Power: The Divine, page 93 Personality Traits: Loyal to Tibor +3, Pensive +2, Tenacious +1 Combat: Dodge: Init +1, Attack n/a, Defense +6, Damage n/a Fist: Init +1, Attack +6, Defense +6, Damage +0 Kick: Init +0, Attack +6, Defense +3, Damage +3 Bludgeon: Init +0, Attack +8, Defense +6, Damage +2 Dagger: Init +1, Attack +9, Defense +8**, Damage +3 Throwing Knife: Init +1, Attack +8, Defense +7, Damage +2 Short Sword and Buckler: Init +1, Attack +9, Defense +8, Damage +5 **	 Laszlo uses two daggers when fighting, with the blade in his left hand used to parry and redirect as others might use a buckler. This gives him a +1 to his Defense score when using daggers. Soak: +3 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+) Abilities: Animal Handling 3 (wolves), Animal Ken 5 (wolves), Brawl 4 (Dagger), English 3 (slang), Folk Ken 2 (peasants), German 2 (slang), Hunt 2 (wolves), Italian 1 (slang), Latin 3 (hermetic usage), Leadership 2 (animals), French 4 (Norman), Second Sight 5 (illusory disguises), Single Weapon 3 (short sword), Magyar 5 (slang), Stealth 2 (natural areas), Survival 2 (woodland), Swim 2 (underwater maneuvering), Thrown Weapon 4 (throwing knife) Equipment: Partial Metal Reinforced Leather Armor, knives, short sword, buckler Encumbrance: 2 (2) Appearance: Laszlo has mid-length white hair and long angular features. He remains scrupulously clean-shaven. His leather and iron ring mail is usually topped with a knee-length hooded traveling cloak, concealing the daggers at each thigh and the belt of small throwing knives around his middle.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Otto spends his days in his Boulogne home and office as a clerk, but supplements his income with commissions from all comers to investigate the strange, the untimely, and the impossible. His office is also the covenant’s nominal council chamber as required by Normandy convention.</div>
<div>Laszlo</div>
<div>Laszlo is a loyal servant of House Tremere and the guardian of Tibor Milos. He is no grog, however, for he is Custos; trusted and respected and first among covenfolk. He has traveled extensively in his time and learned a little of many languages. But it is not this that selected him for the role of Tibor’s man. It was his uncanny ability to speak with the animals. Laszlo has always had a deep understanding and affinity with the beasts of the world and given Tibor’s curse, this ability makes him valuable. He is a pensive man and given rather more to the night than the day. He suspects that’s what tends to make others suspicious of his motives.</div>

<h3>Grogs</h3>

<div>The description of a base covenant in ArM5, page 71 provides for about one grog (fighter) per magus and about two other servants of various trades or professions. The servants are likely to include clerks and cabin-boys to fetch and carry for the magus. These are not detailed here and you should consider the Urchin statistics in Apprentices, page 30 for any young cabin-boys in the fleet. Of the named grogs described nearby, you can assume that each of the covenant’s six magi have one on board their ship with them. Players may like to decide among themselves which of these grogs they claim.</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>Young Feeble Feeble is so called by the turb on account of his stammering and his morbid fear of dogs.</div>
<div>Characteristics: Int –1, Per 0, Pre 0, Com –1, Str 0, Sta 0, Dex +3, Qik +2 Size: 0 Age: 25 (25) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk; Puissant Great Weapon, Warrior; Afflicted Tongue (stammer), Fear (dogs) Personality Traits: Brave +3, Bashful +2, Confused +1 Combat: Dodge: Init –1, Attack n/a, Defense +6, Damage n/a Fist: Init –1, Attack +7, Defense +6, Damage +0 Kick: Init –1, Attack +7, Defense +5, Damage +3 Bludgeon: Init +0, Attack +10, Defense +7, Damage +2 Long spear: Init +2, Attack +14, Defense +11, Damage +7 Soak: +4 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+)</div>
<div>Abilities: Area Lore: Hampshire 3 (taverns), Athletics 3 (running), Awareness 3 (in combat), Brawl 4 (Bludgeon), Carouse 3 (drinking), Organization Lore: Covenant of the Northern Seas 1 (personalities), English 5 (rude words), Etiquette 2 (magi), Fishing 3 (rod and line), Folk Ken 1 (peasants), Great Weapon 5+2 (longspear), Guile 2 (avoiding duties), French 4 (Norman), Survival 2 (for a short period), Swim 2 (long distances) Equipment: Pack; Partial Metal Scale Armor; Long spear, Fishing hooks and line. Encumbrance: 3 (3) Appearance: If there is a way to tie or buckle something wrong and still be wearing it, Feeble finds a way. He bears a look of surprised confusion whenever spoken to and his first instinct is to look for someone to answer for him. This is of course in part because of his bashfulness over his stammer.</div>
<div>Feeble by name, but not necessarily by capability. He is highly-proficient with the spear and his task is usually to close off an enemy’s lines of attack or retreat. He lacks imagination and so when given a task he is happy to continue in that task until told to stop, including during combat.</div>

<h3>Bullcalf</h3>

<div>Bullcalf is the backbone of the turb. Aside from the hulking Hilde, Bullcalf is the largest and strongest person in the covenant. He has a temper, is quick to anger, and is easily outwitted.</div>
<div>Characteristics: Int –1, Per –1, Pre +1, Com –1, Str +4, Sta +2, Dex 0, Qik 0 Size: +1 Age: 30 (30) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk; Berserk, Great Strength, Large; Missing Ear, Uncontrollable Strength*, Wrathful * From the Grogs supplement Personality Traits: Brave +3, Angry +1, Dim +1 Combat: Dodge: Init +0, Attack n/a, Defense +4/+2, Damage n/a Fist: Init +0, Attack +4/+6, Defense +4/+2, Damage +4 Kick: Init –1, Attack +5/+7, Defense +4/+2, Damage +7 Bludgeon: Init +0, Attack +6/+8, Defense +4/+2, Damage +6 Knife: Init +0, Attack +5/+7, Defense +4/+2, Damage +6 Hammer: Init +1, Attack +7/+9, Defense +4/+2, Damage +12 Warhammer: Init +0, Attack +12/+14, De</div>

Oh, and he’s got an ear off.</div>
<div>Bullcalf carries a heavy warhammer, which he uses to devastating effect, especially when his berserk fury takes over. In combat, Bullcalf is the grog at the center of the action. There is no telling which enemy he is going to attack next, it likely switches every round, and in doing so he is frightening and intimidating. To both sides.</div>
</div sidebars>


<div sidebars>

<h3>Silence</h3>

<div>A thief and a rogue, Silence is more used to subtlety and stealth than open brawling. He is often employed on tasks where his skills of stealth and legerdemain come in useful. He can often be seen, on his own, practicing his athletic and climbing prowess, sprinting, and throwing knives at targets.</div>
<div>Characteristics: Int 0, Per +1, Pre –2, Com –2, Str 0, Sta 0, Dex +5, Qik +3 Size: 0 Age: 26 (26) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk; Great Dexterity × 2; Covenant Upbringing, Master of None* * From the Grogs supplement Personality Traits: Brave +3, Disciplined +2, Self-Interest +1, Honorable –1 Combat: Dodge: Init +2, Attack n/a, Defense +6, Damage n/a Fist: Init +2, Attack +8, Defense +6, Damage +0 Kick: Init +1, Attack +8, Defense +5, Damage +3 Dagger: Init +2, Attack +11, Defense +7, Damage +3 Throwing Knife: Init +2, Attack +10, Defense +7, Damage +2 Soak: +1 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+) Abilities: Athletics 4 (acrobatics), Awareness 3 (search), Brawl 3 (dagger), Organization Lore: Covenant of the Northern Seas 1 (people), Disguise 2 (peasants), English 3 (slang), Folk Ken 2 (grogs), Latin 2 (overheard speech), Legerdemain 4 (pilfering), French 5 (Norman), Stealth 5 (urban areas), Swim 2 (stay afloat), Thrown Weapon 3 (throwing knife) Equipment: Dark clothes and short traveling cloak; Pack; Rope; Quilted Armor; Dagger; Throwing knives Encumbrance: 1 (1) Appearance: Fit and wiry.</div>
<div>Silence prefers to use his throwing knives in combat. If these don’t slow his opponent enough, he is always mindful of finding an exit and coming back more prepared. He works well with Fang, with the brawler grappling an opponent to the ground and then Silence coming in with a well-placed dagger.</div>
<div>Shadow Shadow is well-named as he has vowed never to willingly leave his magus’ side. This serious-minded man has trained all his life to be the best possible shield grog he can manage.</div>
<div>Characteristics: Int 0, Per 0, Pre 0, Com 0, Str +2, Sta +1, Dex 0, Qik +4 Size: 0 Age: 25 (25) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk; Improved Characteristics, Great Quickness, Warrior; Covenant Upbringing, Susceptible to Warping*, Unlucky* * From the Grogs supplement Personality Traits: Brave +3, Loyal +3, Overconfident +3 Combat: Dodge: Init +3, Attack n/a, Defense +8, Damage n/a Fist: Init +3, Attack +4, Defense +8, Damage +2 Kick: Init +2, Attack +4, Defense +7, Damage +5 Dagger: Init +3, Attack +7, Defense +9, Damage +5 Longsword & Rectangular shield: Init +5, Attack +10, Defense +15, Damage +8 Soak: +10 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5</div>

Beneath the brim of his iron helmet his eyes watch for any threat to his magus and he is often seen holding people at arm’s length until given permission to approach his magus, even those people the magus knows. He carries a large rectangular shield that some have quipped is very nearly a field pavise.</div>
<div>Unless ordered otherwise, Shadow remains with his magus while in combat, standing off a safe distance and placing himself between his magus and harm. For this reason, he is unlikely to join a combat group and never presses a combat advantage; doing so might leave an opening through which he master might be harmed. Shadow considers himself armored enough to take whatever punishment comes his way.</div>
<div>Fang Fang is a brawler and likes to get in close and grapple. He has a tendency to bite his opponents, claiming it takes the fight out of them, though even his closest friends state it is his foul odor responsible for that. Fang has a weakness for drink and indulges whenever he is given the opportunity, which almost always ends in him becoming embroiled in one fight or another.</div>

<div>Through The Aegis Specialists and Other Covenfolk</div>
<div>A ship cannot function without her crew, so use these statistics for the crewmembers, regardless of which ship in the fleet you need them for.</div>
<div>Ship’s Captain</div>
<div>Given their importance, each ship’s captain is bought as a Specialist from the Covenant’s Build Points. These individuals are described below alongside their ships, but a standard statistics block is provided nearby. Each sea captain costs 5 Build Points.</div>
<div>Sailor</div>
<div>The Sailors Free Choice Covenant Boon describes the main body of the covenfolk. As per the description of the Boon, each sailor costs the covenant a penny each day. At around a dozen sailors per ship, across six ships, that’s a total of 6 shillings each day and around 110 Mythic Pounds per year. These sailors do not have a Build Point cost as they have little bearing on play beyond carrying out duties on board the ships.</div>
<div>Specialists</div>
<div>The covenant does not generally take its specialists with it, which means that the covenant must visit certain ports in order to use the services provided by their specialists. These invariably are Carles’ social contacts, all either paid by the covenant for prompt and preferential treatment or in debt to Carles and Hilde in some way. These specialists are always prepared to take on unusual or even dangerous commissions The following specialists are available, and unless otherwise marked they each cost 6 Build Points for their highest primary Ability. The Chaplain: Clovis knows enough of the Order to know that they frequently endanger their own souls and the souls of those around them. While he tends his parish near St. Malo, he may occasionally sail with the covenant if asked. He is useful as a messenger, a mediator, a neutral party, and as a conscience. He costs 51 Build Points as this includes the cost of his Bible. The Bible: Summa, Theology (Level 10, Quality 3), Summa, Church Lore (Level 3, Quality 3) The Sail Maker: Stephen is a sail maker working out of his Cherbourg sail loft. While skilled, he lacks the innovation in his workshop to make him stand out, something he intends to ask the covenant for help in.</div>
<div>The Carpenter: Hugh is master carpenter with access to wood and timber from across the known world. He is also able to find and pass on exotic wood by request, such as lightning-struck oak, or a cypress upon which a man has hanged for three days. Hugh costs 21 Build Points as this includes a +2 Raw Materials bonus to his workshop. The Rope Maker: Guerrier of Abbeville on the Somme operates a thriving ropewalk. Guerrier costs 21 Build Points as this includes a +2 Innovation bonus to his workshop. Shimon Avraham: Shimon is a prominent tax collector at Barfleur and a strong ally to the covenant. A member of the town’s Jewish community, he owes much to the covenant’s elder magi for help and protection they afforded him and his family some years ago. He can ensure that some cargoes go through the port unchecked and uncounted. He costs 8 Build Points for his Profession: Tax Collector Ability. The Merchants: The covenant has friendly merchants in Antwerp, London, and Paris, which accounts for the stability of their trade and transport income. These three merchants alone may not be able to increase this income, but they do look after the covenant’s interests.</div>

<h3>Thrice-Dead Ned</h3>

<div>Thrice-Dead Ned is so called because he has very nearly died in the service of magi at least three times. He considers himself lucky, though others aren’t as sure. He has an astounding constitution that sees him recover from wounds that would have surely killed other men. Years of patching his own wounds have taught him the art of chirurgery and he sees that his fighting friends are well looked after.</div>

His beard may be gray, his eyes a little rheumy, and he may be a little hard of hearing, but he has a lightness to his step and ready smile.</div>
<div>Thrice-Dead Ned benefits from a Stamina of 4 +3 for Rapid Convalescence in all Wound Recovery Rolls, as detailed in ArM5, page 179. He does however have some Aging Points against a few of his characteristics, which puts him at risk during each winter. Ned isn’t clever, but he isn’t stupid either. He knows he’s getting on a bit and prefers to use his crossbow from range, reloading while others keep danger at bay. Ned uses the Crossbow Ability from Lords of Men, page 138, and spans his crossbow using a belt hook.</div>

<h3>Through The Aegis Covenant Organization</h3>

<div>Six magi, free from the politics and squabbles of their land-locked cousins, sail the seas and oceans and go where adventure takes them. Each magus is master of his own ship, has a captain to command it, and a crew to sail it. They live and work aboard this vessel and this includes study and laboratory activities. The covenant has a number of contacts on land, mostly in the ports and harbors along the Stonehenge and Normandy coastlines. The covenant sails as a fleet, bearing security in mind and the need to bond the magi together. Given the immediacy of its founding, there has been little time for formal councils, but the magi do meet and agree their course and responsibilities for the season ahead. Each magus flies two flags, the first being the covenant’s symbol of a black Cog on a field of White, and the second being their own symbol in the form of a sanctum marker; after all, their ship is their own domain. Laboratory work is typically conducted with the ship at anchor in one of a score of natural harbors and reefs. A life at sea may be conducive to freedom, but the lack of pervading magical aura across the seas means that laboratory work cannot benefit as on land. Alternatively, magi may trade for a season within an aura controlled by friendly covenants.</div>

<h3>Hierarchy and Governance</h3>

<div>There is little of either hierarchy or governance on the Northern Seas. The older of the covenant’s magi have known each other for years and they have a strong bond of friendship, but they are firmly committed to seeing the younger and less experience magi achieve their potential. Each of the magi is, in their own way, an outcast or a misfit, and the Northern Seas provides a welcome harbor from their sea of troubles. Each magus has their vote on the council and must abide by decisions made. The covenant also respects the opinions of its covenfolk and, if they request it, they may speak before the council. Magi are free to study what they will and all are agreed to provide assistance to their colleagues when needed, for instance in exploring where one desires or trading for resources that another might require.</div>
<div>Income and Supplies</div>
<div>There are few laws at sea and the Northern Seas takes full advantage of this. Merchants and smugglers risk their cargoes to pirates, storms, and the vagaries of the ocean. To these can be added the magi of the Northern Seas. Trade may ultimately make up some of the covenant’s income, but the more experienced of the magi are not above taking what they want from ships that cross their paths.</div>
<div>However, the current source of income is from trade; transporting goods from one port to another. On its own, with a fleet of six ships, this should provide a decent income for a wealthy merchant. However, the six ships need to support the same number of magi, which brings its own costs. As described later in the chapter, the small in</div>

<div>come from legitimate trade is not yet sufficient to cover these costs. The covenant has a little time to decide, but the magi of the Norther Seas need to determine how they are going to keep the Northern Seas crews paid, ensure the ships are maintained, and buy the all-important devices and equipment used in Hermetic laboratories. Their trade income is there to be developed and piracy is still being debated. The covenant does have its own reserves of silver, a sizable sum in fact, which should support the covenant for a while, but before long the young covenant will need to earn its keep.</div>
<div>Study and Laboratory Work</div>
<div>The magi of the Northern Seas spend their time as other magi do, in their laboratories, inventing spells, and creating enchanted devices. They face several challenges in this that others do not, principally the lack of a covenant aura and the unusual situation of their laboratories. These laboratories are described in detail later in this chapter and take account of the inherent dangers of trying to work at sea. For particularly delicate work, or in times of severe weather, the magus might choose to anchor up and work from a safe harbor. The lack of aura does not prevent magic from being used of course, but the magi of the Northern Seas do not enjoy the same benefit that other more conventional</div>
<div>magi might. However, the magi are charting the seas and looking for stable magical auras which might one day allow them to benefit while at sea.</div>

<h3>Life At Sea</h3>

<div>Life at sea is hard enough, but there are distinct challenges for a magus whose career consists of long months of study and delicate laboratory work.</div>
<div>Charting The Ocean</div>
<div>The magi of the Northern Seas, young as they are, rely upon their elder and more experienced captains for their knowledge of the ocean currents, storm fronts, and treacherous coastlines. These captains do not, however, have knowledge or understanding of the supernatural auras. The magi of the Northern Seas are therefore setting out to chart such auras that can be found both on the surface of the sea and beneath it. Just as a magus on land might find, follow, and exploit a magical stream, so the magi of the Northern Seas believe they can do the same for currents and flows in the ocean. This is not so far-fetched as some land-locked magi might first think. Consider that magical stream and where its waters come from and go. The waters are within that stream for so short a time, and yet they carry magic with them while part of that stream. The same is true for the currents, swirls, and eddies that every captain knows. The deep currents between Iceland and the Faroes may hold older and stronger magical auras than anyone suspects. Each magus has a copy of the Carta Ma</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>The Gift of Magestones</h3>

<div>While the covenant’s ships lack a magical aura, there exists one tantalizing option; Magestones. The story goes that while Verditius was learning Hermetic magic from Bonisagus he enchanted a number of fist-sized onyx pebbles, each with the two runes for Creo and Vim engraved upon them. These stones each create a localized level 3 magic aura large enough to cover a magus’ laboratory. Apart from a few secretly given to the covenant of Oculus Septentrionalis in the Rhine, Durenmar jealously guards all the remaining stones that they are aware of. However, you may decide that Verditius kept some of these stones back for himself and his followers, and that perhaps he took these stones with him on what became his final sea voyage to ensure that his ship benefited from a magical aura at all times. You may decide that these stones are out there for the finding, perhaps in the hands of mundane nobles who do not know what they have, or in the clutches of Merfolk who might use them to bargain with the magi of the Northern Sea. Perhaps they are in the belly of an enormous whale, grown large and ancient through the action of the magic it carries within itself. Alternatively, you may decide that the precedent set with Oculus Septentrionalis might be repeated and either Durenmar has already given the Northern Seas a set of Magestones or the leaders of House Bonisagus are open to persuasion. Whichever way you approach it, Magestones provide a means of giving each magus in the covenant a valuable magical aura. See Guardians of the Forests, page 70 for more details on Magestones.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The Magical Whale</h3>

<div>Sailing with the covenant for a season, Maris of Tytalus tells tales of an immense whale that brings a magical aura to the surface each time it breaches. A ship tacking alongside can benefit from that aura for a while. Is this just a tall tale of the sea or has Maris discovered a powerful resource? Pressing Maris for more information, Carles asks for volunteers to hunt down the whale and discover the source of its power.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The First Contract</h3>

<div>The covenant has been engaged to take a small cargo of tin from Southampton to Riga. Two nights into the journey, a stowaway is discovered trying to pilfer food. This young girl is no urchin; she is clearly the daughter of someone important. As the magi learn more, it seems that she is fleeing a marriage to an elderly knight arranged by her father for monetary gain. Her sweetheart has already fled her father’s abuses and she is going to Riga to be with him. Can the magi allow themselves to be dragged into this tale of love and loss? What do they do when they discover that this long-lost lover in Riga has himself a new woman? And how do they deal with the angered father now that he has discovered on whose ship she stole away?</div>
<div>Story Seed: The First Act of Piracy</div>
<div>Having heard of a valuable cargo of silver and other treasures on its way to Denmark, the covenant resolves to take it. When they board the ship, however they find little treasure but a handful of monks on their way to save a village from the curse of devilry and witchcraft. The treasure on board is the sacred relics and paraphernalia that they carry with them. Do the magi take the treasure and leave the monks and the villagers to their fate, or do they take the virtuous path?</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>rina, a map of the ocean, which they update. See additional details on the Carta Marina later in this chapter.</div>
<div>The Charter</div>
<div>The charter of the Northern Seas is quite light on the kind of detail that other magi might expect. There are no degrees of membership. Here is a description of the principle clauses:</div>
<div>• Membership is by accord with the existing members. • A magus accepted by the Northern Seas shares his resources with the covenant and in return is given his share of the covenant’s resources. • Each magus is sworn to provide hospitality to his brothers and sisters in the covenant. • Each magus is master of their own vessel. • Each magus has a single vote at council and the elder magus holds the casting vote. • Each magus is sworn to the covenant for no less than a decade, after which he may leave with his rightful share of the spoils. • A magus who stays with the covenant for twenty years may take his ship and his crew on condition that he funds a replacement. • A magus who stays with the covenant for thirty years may take his ship and crew with no obligation to the covenant. • A magus who stays with the covenant for forty years may claim a shipping route or region of the sea to call his own, shall be accorded the respect due to a fully-recognized covenant, and may charter others to himself.</div>
<div>The charter is interesting for the things it doesn’t say. In promoting recognition of rights to a shipping route or a region of the sea after forty years, it implies that such rights would not be recognized before that time. The oldest two magi, Carles and Hilde, supplied the majority of the covenant resources when the six magi formed the covenant, but all took their share. Carles has also shown the way of hospitality by recording all the covenant members on his sanctum marker.</div>

<h3>Covenant Site</h3>

<div>The covenant has few true buildings as it is based on a flotilla of ships. Each ship in the covenant is either a cog or hulk up to size +8 (as per City & Guild, page 77) and has a base value of 52 Mythic Pounds for a ship of Standard construction, 104 Mythic Pounds for a ship of Superior construction, or 260 Mythic Pounds for a ship of Excellent construction, which provide a total of 6, 9, and 12 Damage Levels respectively.</div>

<h3>Life on Board Ship</h3>

<div>Regardless of type or quality, each ship in the flotilla has a capacity of around 125 tonnes and a crew of 13 including the captain. The grogs described above are additional as they occupy a specific role. None of the ships have so far been enchanted or opened for enchantment by a Hermetic shipwright. Each ship can be affected by the standard Hermetic Structure Target.</div>
<div>Anatomy of a Ship</div>
<div>Allowing for differences in individual design, the covenant’s ships are approximately 75 feet in length, 25 feet in the beam, and just over 12 feet from keel to deck. This allows for a cargo hold and a single deck. The magus’ laboratory typically occupies the rear of the cargo hold and is secured against accidental intrusion. The single mast descends through the deck and secured at the base of the ship. This is generally made from a single tree to promote strength. The ship is steered principally through adjusting the sail to capture the wind at different angles, thereby pushing the ship where it needs to go. The steering oar at the rear of the vessel allows for fine control. The crew typically sleep on deck, weather permitting, or find space below deck among whatever cargo the ship is carrying.</div>
<div>Risk of Damage</div>
<div>As per the rules in City & Guild, page 77, each of the ships has a number of Damage Levels. Every time the ship is exposed to an explicit danger there is a chance that the ship may be damaged, losing one of these Damage Levels. These dangers include magical accident or explosion, attack by a sea monster, violent storms or swells, running aground, or collision with another vessel.</div>
<div>Laboratories</div>
<div>Each ship has been fitted with a laboratory of standard size, roughly 20 feet by 25 feet, which costs the ship 25 tonnes of carrying weight. If using the expanded laboratory rules from the Covenants supplement, each additional point of size costs a further 25 tonnes of carrying weight. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: As per individual magus Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +0, General Quality –1, Upkeep +0, Safety –1, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics –1 Virtues & Flaws: Mobile, Extensive Stores; Cramped, Unstable Specializations: Experimentation +2 Each of these laboratories costs 10 Build Points.</div>
<div>Modifying the Ships</div>
<div>The magi may wish to modify their ships once the covenant sets sail and their income improves. Options include improving the onboard laboratory using the rules presented in the Covenants supplement, adding a prepared casting space, and enhancing the vessel through enchantments. A Hermetic shipwright could enchant the entire vessel, but even separate devices can affect the ship as a structure. See the Hermetic Projects supplement for more information on these options.</div>

<h3>La Charytee: Carles Magnus</h3>

<div>La Charytee is a large cog of Excellent construction, having 12 Damage Levels and providing a bonus of +2 to all sailing activities. She has a distinctive tall tower at the rear of the vessel, the balcony of which is richly painted red.</div>
<div>The Reliquary</div>
<div>Carles has outfitted La Charytee with a relic; the Long Bone of Epiphanius. With a Faith Score of 3, the relic, which hangs from the mast within a box of excellent quality, has a Divine Might of 30 and scourges all demons that come within 30 feet of the relic. This covers almost the entirety of La Charytee. The Long Bone costs 35 Build Points, which is 30 for the Faith Score and a fur</div>
<div>ther 5 for the miraculous power it contains. See the nearby box for more details. See also Realms of Power: The Divine, page 43 for more on relics.</div>
<div>Carles’ Laboratory</div>
<div>Carles’ laboratory is dominated by the carved and painted map of the oceans and the skies that covers the chamber’s floor and ceiling. It is very tidy; important given that the working spaces are a little cramped in order to expose as much of the great map as possible. While the sanctum marker bears the names of each covenant member, Carles ensures that his laboratory is guarded at all times and that the guard knows not to admit anyone unless explicitly told by Carles or Hilde. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Hilde Oddfish, Columba of Ex Miscellanea, Matilda Page, Tibor Milos, Andrew of Jerbiton Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement</div>
<div>+2, General Quality +1, Upkeep +3, Safety +1, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics +2 Virtues & Flaws: Extensive Stores, Lesser Feature (Map), Specimens, Guard, Highly Organized, Mobile, Precious Ingredients; Cramped, Unstable Specializations: Experimentation +2, +1 Longevity Rituals; +1 Intellego; +1 Animal Features: Map These enhancements cost 30 Build Points.</div>
<div>Captain</div>
<div>La Charytee is captained by Gilot Vallet, a shaven-headed robust man with exacting standards. His Personality Traits are Exacting +3, Loyal to Carles +2, Reckless –1.</div>

<h3>Marie de Bayonne: Hilde Oddfish</h3>

<div>The Marie de Bayonne is a flat-bottomed hulk of size +8 and Superior construction, providing 9 Damage Levels and a +1 bonus to sailing rolls when sailing close to shore. She is, however, given to frequent leaks and the crew are often kept busy making good and bailing out.</div>
<div>Hilde’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Hilde’s laboratory is constantly damp as the Marie de Bayonne has been modified so that the hull remains sound despite the opening from Hilde’s laboratory to the sea. This opening allows Hilde to leave her laboratory directly into the sea in her shark heartbeast, but the water does slosh into the lab during choppy seas, despite an enchantment that keeps the ocean at bay. The ceiling is strung with fish in various states of decomposition, seaweed, and driftwood. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Carles Magnus Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +1, General Quality –1, Upkeep +1, Safety +0, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics +1 Virtues & Flaws: Mobile, Highly Organized, Lesser Feature (Running Water), Extensive Stores, Specimens; Cramped, Lesser Focus (Running Water), Unstable Specializations: Experimentation +2; Animal +1, Aquam +3 These enhancements cost 30 Build Points.</div>
<div>Captain</div>
<div>The Marie de Bayonne is captained by Taupin le Ribaut, a gray-bearded tyrant who runs a decent God-fearing ship. He’s a fair captain, but woe betide those who fall short of his standards. His Personality Traits are Merciless +3, Pious +2, Loyal to Hilde +1.</div>
<div>The Black Bark: Andrew of Jerbiton</div>
<div>The Black Bark is a large hulk with 6 Damage Levels. Its hull has been painted pitch black to reflect its name, which immediately provides the ship with a certain presence. There is no mistaking the Black Bark when she rounds into port.</div>
<div>Andrew’s Laboratory</div>
<div>The laboratory on the Black Bark has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above.</div>
<div>Captain</div>
<div>The Black Bark is captained by Pierre l’Englais, a vibrant clean-shaven man, secure in the camaraderie he enjoys with his crew. He will gladly lead his crew and risk his ship in any venture, for there is no life but the adventurous life in his mind. His Personality Traits are Adventurous +3, Energetic +2, Cautious –1.</div>

<h3>The Laurens: Columba</h3>

<div>The Laurens is a large cog of size +8 and Standard construction, providing 6 Damage Levels. She is wider in the beam than most other vessels, which makes her slower but more stable in rough seas. Her cargo capacity is 25 tons more than the covenant’s other ships, room that could be turned over quite easily to a council chamber of sorts.</div>
<div>Columba’s Laboratory</div>
<div>The laboratory on the Laurens has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above.</div>
<div>Captain</div>
<div>The Laurens is captained by a Breton by the name of Tiessot. He has a tendency to walk the ship at night, when things are calm</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>The Long Bone of Saint Epiphanius</div>
<div>Saint Epiphanius (died 403) was the bishop of Salamis on the eastern coast of Cyprus and a noted polemicist warning against the dangers of heresy in all its forms. He lived into his eighties and was noted for his mastery of many languages. Carles has acquired the thigh of Epiphanius, which has a Faith Score of 3 and the following miraculous power:</div>
<div>Babel Rejoined</div>
<div>InMe 40 Pen +8, 2/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Hearing Those in the same structure as the long bone of Epiphanius understand the spoken words of all others within the structure regardless of the languages that any of them speak. To benefit, targets must at least nominally be members of either the western or eastern Churches. Jewish and Islamic characters do not benefit, neither do heretics, pagans, or those aligned with the Infernal. The power is activated by invoking Saint Epiphanius in the presence of the bone, something widely-known by the crew. (Effect: Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +3 Hearing; Modifications: +1 for 2/ day, +4 for +8 penetration) This relic costs 35 Build Points.</div>

<div>est, and take his turn on watch. He enjoys these quiet moments when he can be alone with his thoughts. Those thoughts often turn to Columba, a woman he knows he can never have nor ever speak of his affections. His Personality Traits are Thoughtful +3, In love with Columba +2, Protective of his crew +1.</div>

<h3>Le Genet: Tibor Milos</h3>

<div>Le Genet is an ocean-going cog that has been patched and repaired many times in her life. She is of Standard construction and has 6 Damage Levels.</div>
<div>Tibor’s Laboratory</div>
<div>The laboratory on Le Genet has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above. The sanctum is also contains a small cage of iron straps and a strong lock. This is Tibor’s cage into which he goes on those nights he becomes the wolf.</div>
<div>Captain</div>
<div>Le Genet is captained by Susane la Fèvre, a strong-willed and vocal captain and harsh task master. She feels the need to exert her leadership, but marries this with an ability to hold her drink and to haul a rope as well as any of her crew. She also has no qualms with piracy, and is willing to turn her unease at Tibor’s curse into a fearsome legend of the sea-wolf if it helps her cause. Of all the captains sailing for the Northern Seas, Susane is perhaps the most loyal to her own path over that of the covenant’s. Her Personality Traits are Garrulous +3, Showy +1, Loyal to the Covenant –2.</div>

<h3>Trinite: Matilda Page</h3>

<div>Unlike the other ships in the covenant, Trinite is a Mediterranean nef, long bodied with a sturdy keel and towers for and aft. The ship is a gift from the Merfolk to Carles and was once a wreck that laid for many years on the seabed. This gives the ship a weathered patina that Matilda finds pleasing. Trinite has triangular lateen sails, that allow it to tack closer to the wind, meaning it can outpace similarly-sized vessels when sailing into the wind. She has 6 Damage Levels but receives a –1 penalty to any Damage Checks while in the northern oceans. Her Mediterranean design does not fully suit the rougher seas of the north.</div>
<div>Matilda’s Laboratory</div>
<div>The laboratory onboard Trinite has the statistics for the standard shipboard laboratory detailed above. It is situated to the rear of the vessel below decks. Matilda also has an additional workshop in the forecastle at the bow. She calls this her reading room, though actually it is where she practices her scribing and illumination. Her hand has adapted to the constantly-rolling motion of the sea and she is now as accomplished on board Trinite as she is on land, though she suspects that there may be magical means of improving her laboratory to aid with the development of enchanted devices; perhaps a mechanism to keep her workspaces steady no matter the conditions outside.</div>
<div>Captain</div>
<div>The ship is captained by Sarrasin, a Frenchman of Moorish ancestry. His manner, dress, and language mark him out as a Frenchman and any prejudice concerning his descent is soon eased and so he lacks the Outsider Flaw that might normally be expected. His Personality Traits are Patient +3, Paternal to his crew +2, Respectful +1.</div>

<h3>External Relations</h3>

<div>No covenant operates alone and the Northern Seas has its share of allies, rivals, and enemies.</div>
<div>Merfolk</div>
<div>This race of aquatic faeries are anatomically similar to humans from the waist up, but they have a fish-like tail from the waist down. They also breathe water like a fish, having gills located just behind the jawline, often obscured in male Merfolk by prodigious tightly-curled beards. Merfolk have a tendency to the barbaric, though they might claim adventurous instead. Warfare between the different tribes of the sea is a part of everyday life, so much so that a young Merfolk boy does not become a man until he has made his first kill, whether that is another Merfolk, a great beast of the deep, or a human from the world above. Merfolk fight with the trident and net, often using the net to capture their enemies alive, so that they might be sacrificed to their gods. The magi of the Northern Seas have an uneasy alliance with the capricious Merfolk. The mutual respect was initiated not by Carles’ politicking but by the Merfolk’s awe at Hilde’ shark heartbeast. A warband chanced upon Hilde one day and tried to slay the shark. After Hilde had killed seven of her assailants, the others surrendered to the victor. Hilde is now viewed with reverence, like a legendary hero who walks among them. For her part, Hilde claims to find this all a bit unsettling. Regardless, the Merfolk recognize the ships of the Northern Seas and leave them to their business. Use the Triton statistics for Merfolk, as provided in Realms of Power: Faerie, page 90.</div>
<div>The Covenant of Favonius</div>
<div>The covenant of Favonius in the Tribunal of Thebes is, like the Northern Seas, housed on several ships. Like the Northern Seas it also has contacts and properties on dry land. But it differs from the Northern Seas in two important ways; Favonius has the power to enchant its ships and it is ideologically wedded to the current status quo with regards to Tribunals.</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Story Seed: The Rusted Bars</h3>

<div>All iron rusts and corrodes at sea, but never as quickly as that fateful night. Although Tibor retired to his cage at the onset of the wolf, the bars quickly crumbled and broke under the wolf’s attack. This freed Tibor and the wolf had free rein all over Le Genet. Are the crew able to safely recapture their transformed master? Was the rusting of the bars natural or was there a malicious power at work? Who would want to seed fear and mistrust within the Northern Seas?</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Carles has discussed both of these with the Favonius’ leader and principal enchanter, Memnos and hopes one day to both commission an enchanted vessel from him and to persuade him to throw off the Tribunal of Thebes and strive for freedom. For their part, Favonius sees Carles and his magi as following in their wake and wish them nothing but favorable winds and smooth sailing.</div>
<div>John Padbury of House Verditius</div>
<div>John Padbury is a Verditius with a dream. He is a carpenter and budding shipwright attempting to establish a small Hermetic shipyard in Smallhythe in the Stonehenge Tribunal. At present, he is working on his own with a small and hard-pressed band of mundane carpenters and has nothing even approaching the kind of expansive and open laboratory he needs. If Carles and the Northern Seas are keen to help him, however, he is willing to repay the debt in kind by providing such enchantments that they might request. Smallhythe is a little way inland, but the river that runs to the small town is deep enough that coastal busses, hulks, and unladen cogs can navigate quite easily. It is a place already well established in shipbuilding.</div>
<div>Feliadexter, Demon of Wrath</div>
<div>This demon of wrath has possessed one of the crew, placing a portion of its Might into the unwitting sailor, from where it hides and pushes others to wrathful or spiteful actions. Where there is a choice between the virtuous path and the path of sin, Feliadexter tempts, or suggests, or calls for violent or sinful acts. When a thief is caught, Feliadexter’s voice is the one calling out from the back for the thief to be mutilated or hanged, his is the eye that spies a laden merchant ship on the horizon, and his is the finger that points out a cheat. This possessing spirit could be in any of the crew. It can hide safe and secure within its host, shielded even from the scourging effects of relics. For this reason it is not specified on which ship the demon sails or even whether the demon has joined the covenant at this point.</div>
<div>Captain Folpert Berlensis</div>
<div>Captain Folpert Berlensis (Tales of Mythic Europe, page 43), master and owner of the mundane vessel La Main Blanche, is engaged in Hermetic trade in some small way. He is known to the magi along the Normandy and Rhine coast and can often be encountered transporting esoteric cargoes. Lacking the insight that a magus can bring to such services, he nonetheless takes trade that the Northern Seas might on occasion prefer for itself.</div>
<div>With Folpert so well-known to the Order, acts of piracy against him and his vessel would hardly be wise, but they do sail the same waters and encounters are inevitable.</div>
<div>Waddenzee</div>
<div>The covenant of Waddenzee in the Rhine Tribunal are rivals to the Northern Seas by virtue of operating their piracy in waters sailed by Carles and his followers. Although the covenant itself is housed on land, the magi of Waddenzee are notorious pirates and may not think twice about trying to take from the Northern Seas. If things were different, Waddenzee, with its reliance on ships, would make an ideal partner to Carles in founding a new Tribunal, but he cannot in all conscience include them in his plans for fear of the aggression and plunder that might follow.</div>
<div>Oculus Septentrionalis</div>
<div>The Rhine covenant of Oculus Septentrionalis was founded with the intention of extending the Rhine Tribunal’s reach northwards. While this has stalled, the covenant, along with others of similar mind, are examining the possibility of seceding from the Rhine and forming their own Tribunal. At first glance, this looks like a good fit for the Northern Seas. However, these covenants, and Oculus in particular, would bring too much history and politics to the venture to secure a decent start. However, Estrid Danesson of House Ex Miscellanea is a young magus and has a lifestyle very similar to those of the Northern Seas. It may be possible to persuade Estrid to leave Oculus and join the Northern Seas, which would bring new knowledge to the covenant, if only Estrid’s wife could be persuaded to leave her current life to start a new one.</div>

Weakness: Love, freely given Vis: 4 pawns of Mentem vis sordida found in the demon’s bowels Appearance: Feliadexter’s true form is that of a spindly bony man with rips tearing through his skin. His mouth is forced open so far that his head always tips back, and out of it spills a massive tongue as wide around as a grog’s arm. The tongue flails around and it is this he uses in combat as a whip.</div>
<div>The possessing spirit of Feliadexter has a Possession Pool of 15, which should be used in place of the Might Score listed above. Points from this Possession Pool are not regained. His Possession power has no other Might cost other than the points Feliadexter chooses to place within the host. This means that the demon can jump between hosts with no loss of power and, as the part has the powers of the whole, even split off further possessing spirits and place them within additional crewmembers.</div>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<div>The Covenant of the Northern Seas has the following resources.</div>

<h3>Income Sources</h3>

<div>Trade and transport are the chief sources of income for the covenant and this is treated as a Lesser Income Source, earning 40 Mythic Pounds each year. This is insufficient to sustain the covenant.</div>
<div>Enchanted Devices</div>
<div>The following enchanted devices are available. Unless otherwise stated, the troupe may decide upon which ship they can be found.</div>
<div>Brooch of Lungs of the Fish</div>
<div>MuAq 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part This brooch affects the wearer as per the Lungs of the Fish spell described in ArM5, page 122. The effect is constantly active and so the user simply needs to wear it to benefit. The covenant has only one of these at present but the Laboratory Text is available. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) This device costs 10 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Freshwater Barrel</div>
<div>PeAq 20 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual This barrel, when filled once per day from the sea, destroys the saltiness property of the seawater caught within it. Both Carles and Hilde each have one of these devices and the Laboratory Text is available. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Touch) These devices together cost 16 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Master’s Chart</div>
<div>Carles possesses an arcane connection to each ship in the fleet in the form of a carved miniature made from the wood of their frames. When these are individually placed onto this enchanted map, which is the triggering mechanism, the miniatures sail to their appropriate locations. Hilde knows of this map, and Matilda Page suspects, having found a recently cut section of Trinite’s keel. Hilde has a copy of the laboratory text for this device, which was commissioned from a magus of Verdi in the Roman Tribunal. The chart has two effects. The first finds the fleet through individual arcane connections to the vessels placed upon the chart. The second uses the information provided by the first to move these wooden tokens to their appropriate place on the chart. The large chart of wood and parchment has been opened with eight pawns of vis and the two enchantments currently use four of those pawns. This device costs 12 Build Points. Finding the Fleet</div>
<div>InHe 14 Pen +0, 12/day R: Arcane Connection: D: Momentary, T: Individual Provides information on the location of a target ship given an arcane connection to it. (Effect: Base 2, +4 Arcane Connection; Modifications: +4 for 12/day)</div>
<div>Mark the Fleet ReHe 11 Pen +0, 12/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual Moves the token placed upon the chart to the location indicated by the Finding the Fleet effect. (Effect: Base 3, +1 Touch; Modifications: +4 for 12/day, +3 triggered by Finding the Fleet)</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>Story Seed: The Fall of the Mercantile Families</div>
<div>When a series of sustained pirate attacks along the Rhine coast threatens to bring down several prominent mercantile trading families, the Northern Seas must act to protect its monetary interests. When it becomes clear that the covenant of Waddenzee is responsible, the covenant has some hard decisions to make. On their own, they may not be strong enough to oppose Waddenzee, but can they find aid from other covenants similarly affected and similarly intimidated? Perhaps the covenant could instead persuade these separate families to band together and coordinate their activities and their wealth for the protection of all.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Bell of Summoning</div>
<div>CrIm 30 Pen +0, 12/day R: Arcane Connection, D: Diameter, T: Individual Commissioned from a Verditius working out of Verdi, when rung this bell sounds throughout all six ships of the fleet, using up six of its 12 uses. This allows the bell to be rung twice with effect. The bell is housed on La Charytee to be rung when Carles gets to port ahead of a council meeting. The bell is usually rung twice in succession, once to alert the magi and again to give them chance to locate the direction of the magic using their Magical Astrolabes, described below. (Effect: Base 1, +4 Arcane Connection, +1 Diameter; Modifications: +4 for 12/day, +16 for +32 penetration) This device costs 12 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Magical Astrolabe</div>
<div>InVi 40 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual When used against an active magical effect, the astrolabe allows the user to determine the horizontal and vertical directions of the magic’s origins. It cannot provide distance information. The device is used to locate the source of the sound of the Bell of Summoning. When used in conjunction with charts, this provides a confident view on where the bell is. Each ship in the fleet is issued with one of these devices. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch, +3 for increased information; Modifications +10 unlimited use) Individually these devices cost 16 Build Points. There are six of them, for a total of 96 Build Points.</div>

<h3>Library</h3>

<div>Given the covenant of the Northern Seas’ unusual makeup, it does not have a library that other magi might recognize; there are no alcoves, no lecterns, and no dedicated librarian. At present, the covenant’s books are either distributed among the magi or lodged with Otto-Pauels in Boulogne and magi must travel there either to study or to take books away with them. It is surely a situation that cannot continue and the young covenant would do well to</div>
<div>consider their arrangements. It is possible that a magus willing to maintain the library aboard their ship may secure certain favor from the covenant in return.</div>
<div>Arcane Abilities</div>
<div>The covenant has several books on the Realm Lore Abilities, in addition to Magic Theory, Finesse, Parma Magica, and Penetration. Some of these have been paid for through character creation and the others total 81 Build Points.

<div>Laboratory Texts</div>
<div>Many of the covenant’s magi brought their own Laboratory Texts with them when they joined the covenant, so there are a large number of spells and effects to choose from. These should allow the magi to gain a fast grounding in a broad range of spells. These books together cost 98 Build Points. Laboratory Texts are also available for the devices described above, Carles’ talisman, and the scrolls developed by Matilda Page.

<h3>Vis Sources</h3>

<div>The Northern Seas has few confirmed and stable vis sources and the magi may want to search for more during the covenant’s early years. Those sources that they know about and regularly collect from are described below. Most however, are not within Normandy’s traditional boundaries and so these have not yet been declared. Columba and Carles agree that they fall outside of Normandy’s interest and this has yet to be challenged at Tribunal.</div>
<div>Fire From the Sky</div>
<div>10 Pawns of Terram per Year Once a year, the freezing winds sweep down from the north and build over several days, culminating in a thunderous hail storm over the northern seas. In among the stinging hailstones are, on average, ten fist-sized spheres of burning granite that arrive out of the sky like thunderbolts. The magi sail into the storm so that they can quickly locate the burning stones as they fall, using magic to capture them in the air, or to send divers down to the seabed to collect them. The stones can damage any ships they strike, but the magi must sail close and act quick if they are to profit from the venture as the stones lose their vis if not collected within the night. The storm always happens in winter, but it takes an Intelligence + Artes Liberales (Astrology) roll to determine where and how long the magi have to reach it. A low roll leaves the covenant little time to reach the site of the storm and the magi may need to find other ways to get there in time. This source costs 50 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Kraken’s Egg</div>
<div>5 Pawns of Animal each Year A giant kraken rises from the deep every spring to feed and to lay a single egg. It arrives predictably enough two hundred miles southwest of La Rochelle, but it isn’t always clear where she’ll go. Magi may witness the kraken hunting whales or even ships, both of which form a season of useful insight for those studying Animal. This propensity to attack ships is a danger to the covenant, so magi would be advised not to sail too close and to consider strongly whether to intervene when another ship is attacked. Eventually, at some point toward the end of the season, she dives again and leaves behind a single egg that floats on the tide. This</div>
<div>smooth translucent leathery pouch the size of a grain sack contains five pawns of Animal vis. If left in the sea, the egg develops into a new kraken that hatches the following year, losing the vis. If taken from the sea, the egg does not develop and the vis is preserved. This source costs 25 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Summer Fog</div>
<div>5 Pawns of Mentem vis each Year On the last day of July, the inhabitants of the troubled village of Sønder Vorupør shut up their doors and windows against the horrors of the night, for a fog rolls in from the North Sea bringing nightmares with it. Those caught in the fog suffer the effect described below. Magi, however, may collect the fog, gaining on average five pawns of Mentem vis each year. Curiously, the vis itself does not appear to carry the effect, though taking the vis does dissipate it and save the villagers from their nightmares. The fog may be manipulated through Rego Auram effects and the vis is collected in large leather bags.</div>
<div>The Unbidden Horrors CrMe 20 Pen +10, 1/day</div>
<div>R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual Individuals touched by the fog feel unease, rising to dread, through suspicion and fear, and into the horror of their deepest nightmares. The effect lasts through the night, and the screams of those unlucky cursed few can be heard throughout the village of Sønder Vorupør. The memories of the experience live longer than the effects of the magic itself. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; Modifications: +5 for +10 Penetration) This source costs 25 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Black Horse of Boulogne</div>
<div>Four pawns of Rego vis each year. Otto-Pauels knows of a secret pool where a black stallion of enormous size comes every autumn. The horse is of such an unnatural blackness that it can scarcely been seen in the night when it comes. But the horse must once have been tamed for it wears shoes of iron. Each year, the stallion comes to the pool in the clearing and, invisible against the night, it drinks from the pool. If, during its visit, it spies a set of new iron shoes upon the ground, it throws off its old ones and stands</div>
<div>upon the new. When the horse goes, it takes the new shoes with it and leaves a pawn of Rego vis in each of the discarded shoes. The vis is tainted with the realm of faerie and Otto suspects that the horse is associated with a craftsman’s endeavors and gains something from the gift of finelycrafted new shoes. This source is considered a seisin of The Northern Seas and is protected by Tribunal law. This source costs 20 Build Points.</div>

<h3>Vis Stocks</h3>

<div>The covenant’s vis stocks are a combination of pawns held by each magus, two rooks of vis in a sunken ship, and extraordinary spell-like and lesser enchantment vis.</div>
<div>Alfgeir’s Resting Place</div>
<div>Twenty pawns of Dedicated Rego Aquam vis. This submerged wreck of a large Norwegian knarr would be unremarkable but for two factors. The first is that beneath the silt, barnacles, and other detritus of the sea, the hull has been carved with magical Nordic runes, and the second is that this magic has leached into the timbers and can now be collected as vis. This vis is Dedicated Vis, as per Realms of Power: Magic, page 122, to the Technique and Form of Rego and Aquam. This vis costs 6 Build Points.</div>
<div>Alfgeir’s Bones</div>
<div>Five pawns of Lesser Enchantment Corpus vis. The knarr is not all that survived. Its captain also survived after a fashion. His restless corpse, now barnacle encrusted, has the power of self-animation. At present, the thing is chained to the bulkhead deep with La Charytee’s hold.</div>
<div>The Animated Corpse ReCo 24 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual A season spent taming Alfgeir’s skeletal form, which can be achieved as a five-day distraction, imparts a Dexterity equal to the controller’s Intelligence and a Single Weapon Ability equal to the controller’s Finesse as the controller impresses their will upon the corpse. All other characteristics and Ability scores are considered to be zero and/or normal for a typical human. (Effect: Base 10, +2 Sun; Modifications:</div>
<div>+1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) The corpse may dutifully carry out simple instructions, but it is unknown whether this is simply the vis at work or whether there is something more insidious behind it. This vis costs 3 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Oyster King’s Shell</div>
<div>Some years ago, Hilde wrestled the shell off the Oyster King, a great beast four feet in length and nearly three feet at its widest. The two halves of the craggy shell each contain three pawns of Lesser Enchantment vis and while whole each part has the following effect.</div>
<div>The Agile Shield MuTe 14 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual This effect transforms the stone of the giant oyster shell so that it is as hard as the finest steel but as light as beaten tin. (Effect: Base 3, +2 Sun, +1 stone; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) Each half has therefore been turned into a long Norman-style kite shield. The magic in the shell reduces the weight, making the shield easy to use and incredibly strong, treating the shield as of Excellent construction and providing a +3 to Defense but with a Load of just 1. The two shields together cost 3 Build Points.</div>
<div>Fixed Arcane Connections</div>
<div>Carles has two fixed arcane connections to significant places; one to each of Boulogne and</div>
<div>Southampton. He also wears a fixed arcane connection to La Charytee in the form of a bracelet made from strands of the ship’s rigging. Finally, he has a fixed arcane connection to Hilde, which Hilde knows about and grudgingly accepts. These fixed arcane connections cost two Build Points each, for a total of 8 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Magus’ Share</div>
<div>Each magus has fifteen pawns of vis. These are nominally three pawns for each of the Hermetic Techniques, but the troupe may allow some variation in the arts. This costs three Build Points for each magus, for a total of 18 Build Points.</div>
<div>Otto-Pauels’ Share</div>
<div>Otto-Pauels has five pawns of Divine Perdo vis in the form of a small branch torn from a birch tree by an angel. This share costs 1 Build Point.</div>
<div>Dolly Price’s Share</div>
<div>Dolly Price keeps five pawns of Corpus vis in her chambers at the tavern in the event that any of the magi of the Northern Seas need it. It is not clear where the vis originally came from but each pawn has been extracted into a delicately-carved finger bone. Each bone is engraved with writhing celtic knotwork. As far as anyone has so far determined, these pieces have no intrinsic powers. This share costs 1 Build Point.</div>

<h3>Wealth</h3>

<div>There is little actual income generated at present, and so it is fortunate that the covenant has significant monetary stores, bought with 74 Build Points. Some of this money is in the form of treasure, some in the form of silver coin distributed among the magi, and some is lodged with the trading houses of the region. Each magus has silver and other treasure to the sum of 50 Mythic Pounds on board, with the exception of Carles and Hilde who both have 100 Mythic Pounds. A further 340 Mythic Pounds is accessible through mercantile families and societies in London, Brügge, Hambug, Lübeck, Bergen, and Riga.</div>

<h3>The Covenant in Play</h3>

<div>The Northern Seas has been designed as a player covenant providing independence from Tribunal oversight and the opportunity for adventure on the high seas.</div>

<h3>Covenant Themes</h3>

<div>The three defining covenant themes are independence, adventure, and selfdetermination. Independence: Normandy’s influence on The Northern Seas is limited. The covenant has not so far involved itself in Tribunal politics, but it is still beholden to Normandy’s Peripheral Code. A saga on The Northern Seas is about breaking those ties and finding independence on the oceans, that may also mean skirting close to the letter and the spirit of the Peripheral Code. Adventure: Andrew of Jerbiton recognizes the opportunity for adventure inherent in sailing where the wind takes the covenant. There are stories and poems to be had and reputations to be built and The Northern Seas. More importantly, these adventures have a very different flavor to those grounded on solid ground and surrounded by fairie woods and magical valleys. Self-determination: All the magi of The Northern Seas have turned their backs to some degree on what was expected of them; Columba has left the House of her training, Matilda has fled the attentions of the Stonehenge Tribunal, and Tibor Milos must determine his relationship with his lycanthropy. A Northern Seas saga is one in which these young magi help each other to achieve their aims and in that the covenant is designed to combine freedom with collaboration. The Northern Seas is also a Spring covenant, which means that there is work to be done finding and claiming resources, building alliances, and protecting the covenant from challenge and danger.</div>

<h3>Player Character Roles</h3>

<div>The four younger magi are suitable for use as player characters while Carles and Hilde are best used as storyguide characters, either to provide the impetus for ad</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Story Seed: The Oyster Prince</h3>

<div>The long-lost son of the Oyster King returns to the sea to take up his kingdom. His first decree is that those who murdered and robbed his most noble father should be found and made to pay for their crimes. When the creatures of the sea themselves turn against the covenant of the Northern Seas the magi must either go to war with an implacable foe or persuade Hilde to give up her hard-won trophies. Even then, is that enough for the Oyster Prince?</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>venture and story or as resources that the players may call upon to help confront certain challenges. Individual magi fulfill different roles. Matilda Page is a very much the quartermaster and is the maga to go to in order to develop the magical tools they need, including offensive capabilities. Columba provides a route into Order politics, partly because of her understanding of the Code and partly because of her notoriety. Andrew has the potential to be a great generalist, able to provide strong support to other magi, companions, and grogs in the party. Tibor Milos has the potential to protect and control using his strong Rego and spells concerning demons, spirits, and beasts. As a werewolf, he also provides an interesting combat option. The grogs are important as they provide the muscle that the magi individually lack.</div>
<div>Dealing with the Elder Magi</div>
<div>Setting up a covenant with two slightly elder magi NPC characters can sometimes present a challenge to storytelling as the younger magi may seek advice or help rather too readily from their elders. For the Northern Seas, however, this is less of a problem. Carles suffers from a magic addiction, as per the Flaw, and as such is reluctant to cast magic of his own when there are perfectly capable junior magi able to cast their own spells. It is also part of Carles’ plan to make the junior magi more independent of him; he wants them to outgrow him in preparation for the day they leave and found</div>
<div>their own ocean-going covenants. Hilde is prepared to help, but tends to do as directed rather than pro-actively solving problems. She is also generally unwilling to leave Carles for extended periods, especially if the suggested task is going to take her ashore. As for dominating council sessions, Carles only does so through holding the casting vote and that only through age. He abides by council decisions and while he may privately work on a backup plan in cases where he loses the argument, he also works as directed to uphold the council’s decision.</div>
<div>It is also possible that Carles and Hilde may decide to sail separately from their juniors for a season or two, perhaps hunting down a newly-discovered magical sea creature, or charting a new aura. The junior magi are left to determine the covenant’s course, deal with events as they arise, and hopefully grow as leaders and magi out of the experience. This very much places the player characters in charge of the covenant; they have elders they can turn to for advice, but elders for whom it is not in their interests to mollycoddle their juniors.</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Covenant Finances</h3>

<div>The covenant, at present, costs more to run than the income it generates. It has an income of just 40 Mythic Pounds per year, thanks to the Poverty Hook, but is currently spending 133 Mythic Pounds across the same period. The largest cost by far is for provisions. It is assumed that much of the covenant’s food is caught at sea, hence the sizable reduction, but that still leaves the requirement to take on provisions when in port. The expenditure in Mythic Pounds breaks down as follows:</div>
<div>Expenditure   Subtotal  Reduction  Total Buildings   15   –7.5   7.5 Consumables  30   –6   24 Laboratories   11.5   0   11.5 Provisions   75   –24   51 Tithes   0   0   0 Wages   30   0   30 Weapons and Armor  3   0   3 Writing Materials  6   0   6 Total         133</div>
<div>The cost of the weapons and armor includes all in use by the current grogs, companions, sailors, and their captains. There are no weapons in storage. The covenant has enough money in its stores, both on board each ship and banked with mercantile families, to sustain it for the next four or five years, but it is in desperate need of increasing its income and finding further ways to reduce its costs. More on covenant wealth can be found in Covenants, chapter five.</div>

<h3>Loyalty</h3>

<div>The Northern Seas has no particular loyalty problem at present. The covenfolk are wary of the magi and may question their actions in hushed tones below decks, but they know that their own fates, for now, are tied to the success of the covenant. Using the rules on age 36 of Covenants, we get a base loyalty of –30, based on the Gift of the member magi, and a bonus of +2 for having been established a year already. The provision of ship’s captains is treated as a turb captain and a flat bonus of +5 has been applied. Despite the ocean being considered a Healthy Feature Boon, it does not provide a Living Conditions modifier, just a bonus to the roll, so we can’t take advantage of that here. This gives a total of –23 loyalty points, which buys a Loyalty Score of –2.</div>
<div>Base Loyalty    –30 Modifier Covenant Age  +2 Turb Captain   +5 Living Conditions   0 Austerity    0 Total    –23</div>
<div>Furthermore, this is simply the prevailing loyalty. Discipline on board ship needs to be carefully handled if the magi do not want to further alienate their crews. In order to reverse this trend, the covenant could employ a turb captain, steward and a chamberlain, all of whom help to improve the prevailing loyalty.</div>
</div sidebars>


<h3>Through The Aegis Suggested Storylines</h3>

<div>As the covenant is erratically mobile, it is more likely to find the trouble than the other way around. This can be a boon to storytelling as the freedom that the magi enjoy means that some might sail away from the fleet for a season or two, allowing stories to be told concerning just the interested characters. Ranging from stories of exploration, distant lands, and the struggle to survive on the open oceans, there are a number of storylines that can easily run throughout your Northern Seas saga.</div>
<div>Adventure</div>
<div>Play in the Northern Seas for tales of long-lost magical devices, ancient manuscripts, and monsters from the deep. The covenant is young and in need of resources and, given that they can go almost anywhere, they are free to follow up rumors of strange magic, forgotten magi, and creatures causing trouble. The covenant’s magi and grogs are particularly well-suited to an adventurous life; even the more academic Columba has enough sense of adventure to make her home at sea.</div>
<div>Exploration</div>
<div>The cold northern seas are ancient and unchanging, qualities that describe the most powerful of Magical beings and the islands found there may be home to just such creatures. While the lands of the East are known, at least as far as the Holy Lands, the oceans to the west represent uncharted territory. Frisland and Icaria: The islands of Frisland and Icaria can be found in the waters north of Britain and to the south of Iceland. Stories of these islands persist in the tales told by sailors. Powerful magic guards these islands and their exact location is hard to determine, leading some to suspect that they are actually a manifestation of either the Magic or Faerie Realms. Magi of the Order may be interested in these islands for two reasons. Firstly, they may represent new and untouched magical resources. Secondly, and conversely, the islands may at last reveal the secretive Order of Odin, perhaps as they prepare for war with the Order of Hermes. But the truth of the islands may be somewhere in between. There may be old Viking</div>
<div>colonies on the islands, cut off from the rest of the world by the frozen mists that surround them. But are the wyrms and serpents that slumber in the ice their masters or their guardians? And what is true of one island may be the antithesis of the other. Rupes Nigra: The island of Rupes Nigra is a vast black rock over 30 miles across that sits in the middle of a great ocean surrounding the north pole. The entire island is magnetic, which explains why compasses all point toward it. Sailing that far north, travelers encounter biting unnatural weather, ancient spirits of storms and cold, and dread creatures never before seen by man. But the island could offer huge wealth, both in material and in magical terms, untouched and ancient as it is. Even the existence of Rupes Nigra is not widely known, and player characters may become the first to explore it. But finding the island is an adventure in itself as no safe passage has so far been charted. Estotiland: Sailing west by the northern seas, a thousand miles off the coast of Frisland, the island of Estotiland can be found. This vast unexplored land is populated by people who once called Mythic Europe home. They live in great cities ruled by kings which they fund and furnish through trade with Europe, made possible by their mastery of the seas. But the merchants sent out from Estotiland keep their origins secret for fear of their cities being discovered and their lands becoming subject to new crusades by Frankish nobles. The language of Estotiland is unusual and different from the Norse, the British, and those on the continent. In particular they have little knowledge of Latin and seem suspiciously unable to learn it, despite the libraries of secret knowledge found in their palaces, though Estotiland merchants know a little of the Scandinavian tongues. They are tolerant of and hospitable to visitors, but those reaching the shores of Estotiland may find themselves confined to gilded cages, forbidden ever to leave. Drogeo: Also in the west but many miles south of Estotiland is the island of Drogeo. Unlike Estotiland’s insidious dangers, Drogeo is a place of raw Infernal evil and it may even be a manifestation of hell itself. The people in the north of the island are warlike and have little but evil in their hearts. They do not farm or tend the land but take from it what they want. They do not rear herds of livestock but mercilessly hunt the unending forests, killing not for want of</div>
<div>food but for sport, often leaving the carcasses where they fall. They have no knowledge of the Artes Liberales or of Philosophiae or Medicine or of any learning that might sustain a people. They dress in animal skins and hunt with bows and spears tipped with flints. Nor do they have knowledge of God, giving praise to a series of deities, all likely to be demons feasting on the misplaced adulation of a morally corrupted and savage people. The people of the south offer a more pleasing aspect, given that they have knowledge of learned pursuits and live in walled cities, protected from the savages of the north. They also have knowledge of Mythic Europe, learning brought on the winds commanded by powerful sorcerers, and even possess books and other artifacts brought by sailors when their ships wrecked against the island. But the veneer of civilization is thin as the people of the south are cannibals and unwary crews or those unfortunate to run aground may face an end worse than death itself. The Purple Islands: The Ancient Magic supplement devotes a chapter to the Purple Islands lost amid uncharted waters. The gardens of the Hesperides can be found on the island of Junonia and it is there that explorers can find the zero point for the system of Ptolemaic Coordinates. See Ancient Magic, chapter seven for more detail. South of the Sun: The cosmology discussed in Art & Academe (page 27) suggests the tantalizing prospect of the Magic Realm being physically manifest south of Africa beyond the great ocean that separates the north from the south. But it is not just a vast ocean that explorers must contend with but the searing impassable heat caused by the proximity of the Sun to the Earth at the equator. Hermetic magic may be unable to protect magus, ship, or crew against the heat of the Sun, perhaps because of the encroachment of the lunar sphere. Alternatively, perhaps this is precisely the place where magi of the Order can study the lunar sphere with ambitions of achieving a famous Hermetic breakthrough. Whatever the case, navigating to and surviving within this most torrid place is nothing short of miraculous.</div>
<div>Lost and Drowned Cities</div>
<div>Beyond islands, there are stories of sunken and drowned cities in almost every ocean, some cities, such as Atlantis, accumulating so many stories that no one can be sure where</div>
<div>they are, how they might be reached, or what might be found. Atlantis: To those schooled in classical texts, the most famous lost city is Atlantis. Said to have once been home to the Gods of the Greek pantheon, the city fell into ruin when the children of the gods and mankind took their utopia for granted and greed and lust befell them. The gods sank the city in a great flood in punishment for their sins. Atlantis may still exist, surrounded by regiones, either still on the surface of the sea or far beneath the waves. There may be wizards schooled in ancient Greek magic seeking for a way to release their people, calls for help that may make their way to magi exploring the oceans of Mythic Europe. But have the people of Atlantis given up their lustful, greedy, and envious ways? Have the centuries mellowed them or will ancient Atlantean weapons forged by Hephaestus be turned against Mythic Europe? Tartessos: The lost city of Tartessos is a tragic kingdom ruled by a heartbroken king. Once a proud and powerful trading nation that sent ships to all corners of the known world, Tartessos sank into the sea at the mouth of the Guadalquivir river near the city of Cadiz in the Iberian Tribunal. See Legends of Hermes for more information on Tartessos.</div>
<div>A New Tribunal</div>
<div>Carles wants to found a new Tribunal. This covenant is the first step toward that aim, but there will be many more. He needs to bring his new covenant on board with his plan, something he has already done with Hilde and Columba. He needs to research the Code further to look for clauses or rulings of which he is not yet aware. And he needs to persuade others to his plans, against much opposition. His current plan involves assisting in the foundation of three other ocean-going covenants; one in Stonehenge, one in Hibernia, and another in either the Rhine or Loch Leglean. This should provide at least twelve magi across four separate covenants, which is considered the legal minimum required to found a Tribunal. This is going to take time and resources. Other magi need to be persuaded as to the benefits of founding an ocean-going covenant, and getting them started may require the purchase of ships, the hiring of crews, and a great deal of support. Even once this is done, there is no guarantee that these young covenants will embrace Carles’ aims and the politics are going to be difficult.</div>
<div>If you are following the Lotharingian Tribunal saga seed presented in The Lion & The Lilly, then both sides of this debate may seek to secure the support of the Northern Seas for their own political devices, irrespective of Carles’ own future aims. There may be opportunities in this for those prepared to play the long game.</div>
<div>The Involvement of House Tremere</div>
<div>Tibor Milos has a duty to report back on the activities of the Northern Seas and his parens at least may try to disrupt the covenant’s aims. This provocation may escalate if House Tremere considers any actions taken against one of their members to be an insult to the House.</div>
<div>The Loss of a Founder</div>
<div>Carles is the wind in the covenant’s sails, so what happens when Carles disappears? Do the magi look to the shark-tempered Hilde for guidance or do they take control of the covenant’s destiny? And what then do they do with it? Or do they go looking for Carles and attempt to rescue him from whatever far off land or realm he is lost within?</div>
<div>The Voice of Sin</div>
<div>The demon in the fleet will not show himself easily; he is too cowardly for that. This gives him time to possess the crew, use their voice to call for piracy, theft, violence, and cruelty. How long before the character of the covenant becomes corrupted and the magi turn from scholars to pirates?</div>
<div>The Cold Northern Seas</div>
<div>The Order of Hermes are not the only wizards on the seas. Rune Wizards, Trollsynir, and Muspulli may be found in the cold north on both land and at sea. These wizards might have alliances with all manner of great serpents of the deep to control the icy waters of the north, and this would prevent the covenant from fully exploiting northern resources as they would like. Can accommodations be made or must the covenant go to war with these magical traditions and their powerful allies?</div>
<div>The Unfriendly Waters</div>
<div>More can be made of the other covenants of the region and beyond that operate at sea. Rivalries can escalate and it might take but one misunderstanding to start a feud with Waddenzee, or make political enemies of Oculus Septentrionalis.</div>
<div>Longevity and the Like</div>
<div>With few resources to call upon, it does not take long for the covenant to feel their lack of magical power take hold. Carles and Hilde find it difficult to recreate their longevity rituals, which comes as a warning to the younger magi. The covenant must decide whether it is to become truly self-sufficient and find a way to provide for themselves, or it must find allies prepared to help them in areas where they cannot yet help themselves.</div>
<div>The Hermetic Tourney</div>
<div>As with any covenant of the Normandy Tribunal, the Northern Seas is expected to take part in the tourney; the magical competition with both resources and pride at stake that takes place at the conclusion of each Tribunal gathering. As a young covenant, Carles is under no illusion about their prospects, but he would like the covenant to win at least one event, if only for one year, before the covenant breaks away to found its own Tribunal. The covenant’s grogs seem rather keen to take on the melee, and the covenant may look to Tibor to take on the certamen tournament.</div>
<div>The Northern Seas as an NPC Covenant</div>
<div>The magi of the Northern Seas can fulfill many roles in existing sagas, from allies to adversaries, suppliers to customers, and perhaps even more.</div>
<div>Allies</div>
<div>Those who provide support to the Northern Seas could stand to benefit. There are several reasons to do this, of course. If Carles succeeds in having the oceans deemed fit territories for new Tribunals then the wealth of the oceans is ripe for exploitation for those who arrive early. In supporting Carles now, his knowledge and support later</div>
<div>would be invaluable. Also, the covenant of the Northern Seas is nominally in the Normandy Tribunal. Lip service paid to Carles’ aims potentially secures six votes at that Tribunal. Your saga can easily realign the covenant’s Tribunal membership to the Rhine, Provencal, Stonehenge, or Hibernia to better fit your own magi. The principle remains the same. Magi who have been disadvantaged by the actions of pirates, sea monsters, or other sea-going magi might wish to engage the Northern Seas for assistance.</div>
<div>Adversaries</div>
<div>The magi of the Northern Seas are not above piracy and this could, wittingly or unwittingly, push them into conflict with other magi. Unless a ship flies a recognizable Hermetic flag, its cargo could be at risk. Unless that cargo is in some way magical, charges of depriving a magus of his power usually do not succeed against such piracy. Other magi have already reached a similar conclusion to Carles and they too attempt to exploit the seas. The covenant of Waddenzee in the Rhine are pirates and sagas based in Waddenzee, or a similar covenant, are likely to clash with the covenant of the Northern Seas from time to time. Quaesitor or politically-oriented characters may be tasked with investigating the covenant to discover firstly whether the magi are guilty of any Hermetic crimes and secondly whether Carles and his scheme poses any danger to the Hermetic status quo. The magi of the Northern Seas are likely to be resistant to attempts to pry into their affairs and motives, at least until they can address things on their own terms. If they trust their inquisitors, they may invite them to travel with them for a season or</div>
<div>more, and during that time they may expound on the possibilities of the sea. Inquisitors may find themselves drawn to the charismatic Carles and persuaded by Columba’s detached logic.</div>
<div>Suppliers</div>
<div>The ocean is home to strange beasts and foreign plants, soils, salts, and stones that many magi might never had read of let alone seen or handled. Imagine a magus in the deepest forests of the Rhine presented with the ink harvested from a magical squid. What strange undiscovered properties, all new to Hermetic understanding, might that magus research? A whole new world of objects of Virtue, extraordinary vis, and shape and material bonuses are opened up and covenants like the Northern Seas are instrumental in this.</div>
<div>Customers</div>
<div>For all their freedom, the magi of the Northern Seas do not carry everything they need with them and nor can they provide every service that they might need. The ships housing the covenant may require repair from time to time, as well as replacement supplies, and potentially new build work. A Hermetic Shipwright (Hermetic Projects, chapter 4) would do well to seek out the Northern Seas as they could be a valuable customer, given the six ships currently in the fleet and the potential for expansion. The covenant would willingly trade vis for enchantments, both discrete and to entire ships, and the covenant could keep a Hermetic Shipwright busy for many years. Hermetic Architects (The Mysteries: Revised Edition, page 97) might see the covenant as a particular challenge; could they create rituals that give particular structures discrete</div>
<div>magic auras? How could such auras be sustained? The Northern Seas may be willing to fund such original research, given that success would open up the oceans of the known world to magi of the Order. As the covenant grows, the magi may acquire properties ashore, perhaps even in magic auras, that they might need others to watch over for them. Spring covenants may benefit from this arrangement as they gain use of Northern Seas properties, while making them available to the magi when needed. Vis sources might also be treated in the same way, with magi collecting vis on behalf of the Northern Seas and taking a share in return. Alternatively, The magi of the Northern Seas may not invest directly in land, but might instead pay a stipend for the use of facilities, resulting in frequent visits.</div>
<div>Filial Relationships</div>
<div>The magi of the Northern Seas are predominantly young, barely out of apprenticeship in some cases. This means that those characters could be used as or replaced by the filii of your saga’s magi. This gives your existing covenant a link to the Northern Seas, with perhaps obligations to support individual magi along with opportunities to be brought into their unique stories. Player apprentice characters may decide, like Columba, to run away to sea, swept away with the romance and adventure of it all. The Northern Seas would make a good backdrop to stories of these apprentices discovering more about themselves in an environment that contrasts with the more formal and more usual covenant that they came from. In such stories, the other troupe players could easily pick up and play the magi of the Northern Seas.</div>

<h1>Chapter Three Jardin: A Summer Covenant</h1>


<div sidebars>
<div>La Jardin stands nestled in the vineyards of the Cahors district, on a rocky bluff a day’s journey south of that city. From the main road, one can see an impressive red brick structure with a copper dome, and a golden brick tower, rising above the ancient walls of a crumbling Visigothic fortress. Those traveling up the winding road that leads to the covenant soon cross an ancient series of defensive earth ramparts, now forming terraces for vine trellises rich with the great black grapes of the region. Approaching through the vineyards, the visitor arrives at Belfort du Quercy, a small village of prosperous peasants that stands on the slopes a mile from the Toulouse – Cahors road. A sleepy collection of well built cottages, its tiny chapel of impressive red brick testifies to the wealth the grape has brought. Traveling onwards up the ridge, the visitor enters through what were once the gates of the fort, to find the covenant itself. The covenant comprises a collection of buildings clustered around the domed library and tower, and a beautifully laid out landscape of flowers, pools, rocks and shadegiving trees: a hermetic garden, in the center of which stands the tower, home to the famed chatelaine Joia du Lua (Occitan for “Jewel of the Moon”). Now over sixty summers old, she uses her magic to ensure she is still as beautiful as the youngest maiden. Her years have given her great wisdom as well as more lovers and temporal influence than any other of the great patronesses of the troubadours. Jardin is an insular, inward looking covenant, where by custom women are rulers and men (in theory) courteous subordinates. A constant stream of visitors — musicians, poets, knights errant and great nobles among them — bring adventure constantly to the covenant, as they glimpse their Heart’s Desire, and realize the curse they have invoked upon themselves. Sometimes the magi are forced to use all their talents to prevent inadvertent repercussions in the mundane world.</div>

<h3>History</h3>

<div>The Visigoths built a fort here, but it soon lay abandoned to the southern winds and slowly the walls crumbled. Eventually a small hamlet grew up on the slopes. In 1130 a young knight built a manor, and under the benign lordship of the Montdumerc family the hamlet grew in to the prosperous village of Belfort du Quercy. Joia Montdumerc was born here to noble</div>
<div>parents. When her father fell in a baronial war in 1163 it was her mother Audiarda who came to rule these lands. Audardia engaged a tutor for her daughters, Humbert de Cavirac. Humbert was a magus of House Jerbiton, and took the position because he realized Joia possessed The Gift, and that the site was magically potent. Hence the covenant of Belfort (today renamed ‘Jardin’) was founded in 1164, composed of just Humbert and his young apprentice, Joia. Humbert soon became the lover of Joia’s mother Audiarda, and the two daughters grew up in the nascent covenant. Soon afterwards a Bjornaer magus, Androcles, arrived. Befriending the Jerbiton, he became the second magus resident, also taking an apprentice, the young Lexora. Joia was trained by Humbert to be a Mentem specialist in his image, but Androcles’ tales of the magical gardens of Herisson (see Legends of Hermes) intrigued her and led her to develop a strong interest in the vineyards on which the covenant’s prosperity depends. She developed some skill in the crafts of gardening and winemaking. Her plan to construct the Garden of Love sung of by the troubadours became an obsession, and after the Final Twilight of Humbert and death of Androcles her romantic pursuit of beauty led to the renaming of the covenant, now called Jardin. Joia has completely changed the nature of the covenant in attempting to create the mythical Garden of Love of the troubadours within</div>

<h3>The Legend of Jardin</h3>

<div>Most in the Tribunal know of Jardin by reputation, as a place of strange customs, odd magi, and traditional ways, and some say one of the customs is an evil one. Even the Redcaps prefer not to tarry too long, for it is rumored that to come here and stay three nights ensures one will glimpse one’s heart’s true desire. It is said that hidden with the gardens are entrances to the fabled Garden of Love,</div>
<div>which Andreas Capellanus has hinted at in his writings. The mysteries of that regio are so profound and dangerous that many a brave maga has set out to explore her heart, never to return. Some are intrigued and seek out the place, but many magi have little interest in such things. The legends are wrong, but the truth is even stranger.</div>

<div>the walls. By creating the myth as a physical place, and encouraging troubadours to popularize the idea of Romantic Love and the secret Garden of Love, Joia has managed to change the once Magical aura of the place to Faerie, and now the place has become the haunt of wild and dangerous faeries, although they are, so far at least, largely confined to the garden regio. Joia’s actions have deeply divided the magi, and led to a state of tension that continues to this day. With the death of Audiarda in 1198 it was Joia’s sister Esquiva who took on the role of chatelaine of Belfort. She had married a wealthy local merchant, Ramundus, in her twenties. Both became fully involved with the life of the covenant, doing all they could to protect and support it. Ramundus worked hard to establish the trade in black wine and improve the yields of the vineyards, and Joia assisted subtly by magic. Ramundus and Esquiva had one child, again a daughter, born in 1189 and named Serena. It is Serena who perhaps poses the greatest danger to the covenant, for while she serves as autocrat faithfully, she deeply resents her position as a servant, and wishes to re-establish herself in her rightful role as chatelaine. However a further threat comes from the lioness Bjornaer Lexora, who seeks to restore the sacred magical Bjornaer Mystery site that she believes Joia’s faerie meddling has corrupted.</div>

<h3>Boons & Hooks</h3>

<div>Autocephalous (Major Boon): The covenant benefits from the traditions of the County of Toulouse and owes fealty to no noble but Serena. This independence from the feudal system is typical of the region. Aura (Minor Boon): The aura of the covenant is four, and extends over the whole fortress. It is not high enough to cause Warping in the grogs and covenfolk residents. Edifice (Minor Boon) x2: These virtues represent the impressive library and tower within the covenant. Loyal Covenfolk (Minor Boon): The grogs of Jardin are in the main local to the lo</div>
<div>cation and fiercely loyal to the covenant. They are generally confused by, and attempt to remain above, the internal squabbles of the magi. Prestige (Minor Boon): While the Tribunal generally pays little heed to the covenant, it is famous among troubadours for the hospitality and patronage offered, and is regarded with affection by many Occitan speaking nobles of romantic inclination. If the covenant was ever threatened, they may speak out or plot a defense. Jardin has a reputation of 3 among troubadours (and local nobility). Vivid Environment (Minor Boon): Even before the aura was corrupted to Faerie the covenant was a place of incredible beauty, and now the gardening has turned it into a lush sensual paradise, a place of incredible beauty.</div>

<div>New Spells</div>
<div>The Well Tended Vine CrHe 5 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Individual Affects any plant, not just vines, but it was designed by Joia to protect the grape crop initially, and later to win prizes for best vegetable in village contests, before turning it to use on her gardens. The spell effects a plant of a mass equal to ten paces in each direction (that is the size of a small tree, or large vine). While under the influence of this spell the plant grows well, healthy and strong, and any fruit are large and succulent. It does not create the plant, and the plant does not become magical; it simply promotes healthy growth. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)</div>
<div>The Healthy Vine CrHe 5 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Individual Protects a plant of similar size to that described in The Well Tended Vine (above) above from all disease. Joia created the spell to protect the grapes during an outbreak of Powdery Mildew, a vine disease, but uses it extensively on the garden. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)</div>
<div>Create the Flowers of the Moon CrHe 15 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Group Decorates a room with fresh flowers that grow normally and require care and watering. The quality of the floral display is determined by a Finesse roll. The flowers persist until the spell expires, then simply cease to exist. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, Group +2)</div>
<div>Cool the Lover’s Ardor ReMe 20 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Individual The lover is caught for a moment by Joia’s eye, and thinks better of making any advances toward her until dusk or dawn. They know she will not welcome them. (Base 5, +2 Sun, +1 Eye)</div>
<div>Detect the Gift InVi 20 R: Personal, D: Concentration, T: Touch Joia found the process of locating a suitable apprentice difficult, and after several neardisasters when children she was hopeful of turned out to bewitched, faerie struck, influenced by demons, or in one case simply unbearably mad, she returned to the laboratory to create a spell that would confirm if a potential apprentice possessed The Gift. The child’s hair, Gifted or not, develops a subtle fragrance of flowers for a few hours after being touched. (Base 10, +1 Concentration, +1 Touch)</div>

</div sidebars>

<div>Wealth (Minor Boon): The covenant enjoys considerable wealth, as described in the Resources section. This can be as much a curse as a blessing, with armies moving around the region, and the inhabitants do not advertise their riches too widely, encouraging discretion even among the covenfolk. Regio (Major Hook): Within the walls of Jardin lies the famous Garden of Love: a tranquil, beautiful place that masks deadly danger and great power. A deeper level of the Faerie regio can inadvertently be entered by becoming lost in the maze, and the inhabitants of the regio can be dangerous. Most dangerous of all is the fact that anyone entering may discover their Heart’s Desire, and be forever consumed by the pursuit of this passion. (See The Garden of Love, later). While the original aura of Jardin was Magical, the legends and stories of the troubadours and Joia’s experiments with physically building a fictional garden in reality have given rise to two strong Faerie regiones which have replaced the earlier magical ones. War Zone (Major Hook): While the history of the region is marked by incessant warring between minor independent lords, the Albigensian Crusade has led to a very real threat of massacre and destruction. Joia has very clearly allied the covenant with the Southern cause, yet attempts to keep Jardin out of the eyes of the marauding armies. Eventually Jardin will become caught up in the Crusade, and even if it does not, a return to the incessant warring of the minor nobles could be just as dangerous. Crumbling (Minor Hook): The walls of the fortress are dilapidated, and sections are unsafe. It is less defensible than one would hope, which given the risk from the Crusade could become a major issue. Obvious repairs or improvements, however, run the risk of drawing hostile attention to Jardin and provoking an assault. Faerie Aura (Minor Hook): The aura has in the last decade switched to Faerie, weakening the magi’s magic and exposing them to increased risk from the inhabitants of the garden. In addition, while such changes in the nature of an aura are not unknown, they are not well understood, and if Jardin’s situation becomes widely known in the Order, scholarly magi will want to investigate. Faerie Regio (Minor Hook): Because the regio of the Garden of Love is a Faerie regio, it counts as a Minor Hook in addition to the Major Hook for the regio itself. Road (Minor Hook):The covenant stands on the main road from Cahors to Toulouse, which is busy all day. Being on a rise only a mile from the road, with large stone walls and the impressive library building and tower, it attracts all manner of visitors. Weary travelers seek safety</div>
<div>and a bed for the night, knights seek adventure in the Garden of Love, magi call by seeking refuge from the dust of the road, and priests arrive to question the beliefs of the inhabitants in the attempt to root out heresy. As such the covenant must deal with unexpected guests on a regular basis, and special arrangements are in place to prevent the magi being unduly disturbed.</div>

<h3>Magi</h3>

<div>There are currently six magi on the Council of Jardin, listed here in order of precedence as established by the Charter (see later).</div>
<div>Joia du Lua of House Jerbiton</div>
<div>Joia du Lua poses as chatelaine, and is a renowned patron of troubadours and advocate of Occitanian culture. It was she who, inspired by the songs of the troubadours, found a way to recreate the mythical Garden of Love, and in her attempt to protect the South she has allowed many to quest for their Heart’s Desire within the regio (see later). On occasion this has led to disaster, as the quester has returned changed terribly by their experiences within, or not returned at all. The magi have taken action to cover up these incidents, or selectively change the memories of the victims of the garden. Joia’s passionate support of Occitan culture extends to political support for Count Raimond, and a so far passive opposition to the claims of the French monarchy, the de Montfort family, and the crusaders. She thinks nothing of sheltering faidits, those dispossessed by the fighting, as long as they share her patriotism for the County of Toulouse. Her hostility to the French extended to poor treatment directed at Beatriz, her French-born apprentice, and sooner or later she will bring the attention of hostile armies upon the covenant, just as befell Bellaquin in 1202 or Lariander in 1209. Joia inspires many lovers in fin amor, but has never consummated any of her romances. To do so would be a breach of the noble ideals of romantic love. Nonetheless her beauty, based more upon her enchanting personality than physical looks, is such that vain women detest her, and for this reason she has the Envied Beauty Flaw (see Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 56). Joia’s magic manifests her sigil of the delicate perfume of summer flowers.</div>

<h3>Lexora of House Bjornaer</h3>

<div>Lexora is the second maga of Jardin, a position that never ceases to infuriate her. She was apprenticed to Androcles before he came to the covenant, and even though she is slightly older than Joia and was Gauntleted at the same time, Joia takes precedence through her family connections. Lexora is immensely proud, and refuses to accept she is second in anything; she schemes to seize the position of first maga, and disagrees on principle with anything Joia proposes. She spends increasing amounts of time roaming the region in her lioness Heartbeast form, engaging in physical combat as a way of dealing with the frustration of life at home. She has Initiated the Bjornaer Mystery of Sensory Magic (Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 27) and soon plans to take another Initiation, perhaps traveling to Crintera to learn the mysteries of Clan Maruhs, to which she belongs (Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 12). She hates with a passion Joia’s corruption of the Bjornaer magical site, and despises the Garden of Love and the faeries within it. The site was an ancestor site of Clan Maruhs, wherein occasionally Panthera the Terrible, a Great Beast of the clan, was to be found, redtoothed and gnawing upon the remains of one of the lycanthropes who plagued the region in past centuries. Joia has effectively destroyed the site, by taming it to a story and making the wild hilltop woods a garden, an artifact of humanity, and for this sacrilege alone Lexora could have grown to hate her, even if she did not take the position of pack leader that Lexora feels is rightfully hers. Despite these issues, the two grew up together and their bickering is currently that of siblings, who would unite in the face of an external threat. She dislikes the covenant autocrat, Serena, and is the only maga present who realizes the threat Joia’s niece represents to the future of the Covenant. While caring nothing for matters of religion beyond her own vague Graeco-Roman paganism culled from her reading in the classics and her interest in the mysteries of House Bjornaer, she suspects that Serena sympathizes with the Crusade. Lexora is too proud to bow to God or man, and her pride is a tragic flaw that will probably prove her undoing. Xenophanes is not fond of Lexora. Only the friendship between his familiar Hypatia and Lexora keeps the two on speaking terms. Ahenobarbus agrees with Lexora that the covenant is weak and needs to build up its defenses in the face of the mundane threats of the Crusade and wars, but has a strong personal dislike for her as his key ally is Serena. Further,</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>while he accepts she would be a better leader than Joia, he favors a defensive, rather than aggressive, approach to the enemies without, and finds Lexora arrogant and hard to cope with. Lexora’s casting sigil is warm sunlight. When viewed by Intellego Vim magics, the effects of her spells have a dazzling golden aura, and objects or people affected by her may feel the warmth of the sun, or appear brighter than usual.</div>

<h3>Xenophanes of House Criamon</h3>

<div>In the late twelfth century House Criamon embarked upon a remarkable experiment, an attempt to teach a fool wisdom. Xenophanes is a very unusual magus, in that he is not very bright. In fact, he is fairly stupid, lacking common sense, and, while highly educated, simple minded. He rushes in where angels fear to tread, and is very confident in his own abilities, because he knows no better. A capable magus, his lack of understanding of much that happens around him is potentially dangerous. Not all in House Criamon approved of the</div>
<div>experiment (see Miniatia Sophia, later) but the Cave of Twisting Shadows, where the boy was apprenticed, regards the experiment as a major development in the pursuit of The Enigma. A gentle soul who loves tending the garden in the pale light of the moon while Hypatia, his cat familiar, prowls around, Xenophanes has little understanding of the internal politics of the covenant. He is, however, very attached to the local Cathars, and has written a book on their beliefs and ideas. As such, he is sympathetic to the Gorgiastic Cathars of Toulouse, but he has not yet decided to renounce his House and join them, as every time he comes close he talks to Father Augustine and becomes too confused to leave the Church and make the leap of faith of fully</div>
<div>Joia du Lua of House Jerbiton (Cont’d) Story Seeds for Joia</div>
<div>Despite Lexora’s ambitions for leadership, in many senses Joia is Jardin: she created the covenant in its present form, completely changing the legacy of Humbert and Androcles. Almost every Jardin story involves Joia’s presence or schemes.</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Jealous Trobairitz</div>
<div>Titbores is a prominent female troubadour, a trobairitz, who writes vulgar and often satirical poems about the chatelaines who sponsor and support her male troubadour colleagues, but who have shown little regard for her verse output. Her actual identity is currently unknown, though it is clear she must be someone of social prominence or well connected to the troubadour movement of the County of Toulouse, even if she may get some of her observations from the barbed gossip of her male associates. Whoever Titbores is, she has recently developed a particularly unpleasant grudge against Joia, and the characters hear bawdy songs sung by minstrels in taverns that originate from her poetry, songs that comment extremely unflatteringly on Joia’s supposed warts (on the face and elsewhere) and her being a hagged old crone, who only manages to maintain her influence by witchcraft and sorcery, and who is “poisonous as the warty toad, yet lacks the rough charm thereof”. Joia is incensed and tries to narrow down a list of influential Occitan women to find out who this slanderous woman is and why she has begun her campaign against her. The campaign is all the more worrying because Joia does use sorcery to maintain her beauty.</div>
<div>Story Seed: Star Crossed Lovers</div>
<div>Joia often hosts ‘entertainments’ in the Summer Garden for young noblemen and women she has come to know and trust. At these events, troubadours recite and sing, and servants discreetly serve the finest wines to the masked guests. A recent garden party has resulted in potential disaster for the cause of the South, however. Rogier Bernard, a heroic war leader and son and heir of Count Raimond-Rogier of Foix, has fallen deeply in love with Guida of Rodez, daughter of the proud lord of Rodez Comte Henri of Millau. Both families are deeply committed to the cause of the South, and are gathering forces to resist the inevitable French invasion, but for a century Rodez and Foix have been involved in a series of bloody skirmishes and at times open war over disputed lands in the region of Lourdes. The hatred between the boy’s and girl’s fathers is so intense that neither is at all likely to accept a marriage. Worse still, Rogier Bernard is betrothed to Maria d’Artagnan of Béarn, and Guida to Gilbert, a nephew of the Count of Provence. Joia notices the two flirting with approval, but when, that night, they elope, the rest of the party, including prominent vassals of both parties’ parents, are aghast and demand Joia does something, anything, to prevent a scandal that could destroy the united front under the flag of Toulouse against the gathering threat of a resumed crusade.</div>
<div>Story Seed: Joia’s Heart</div>
<div>It was long assumed by many that Joia would marry the man who courted her most assiduously, and who she called “her perfect knight”: the younger Raimond</div>
<div>of Toulouse, heir to the title of Count of Toulouse. Joia is friends with Count Raimond, and was very fond of his son, and vice versa, but in 1211, for political reasons, Raimond was married to Sancha of Aragon, the daughter of Alfonso II of Aragon, hence ensuring the firm support of Aragon for the Southern cause that had been threatened by the death of King Pedro II at the Battle of Muret. Joia, however, took the disappointment well, and it is said that Raimond still courts her in a chaste manner. One day while out riding with a hawking party, however, Joia comes across a handsome young knight who joins the party, and for perhaps the first time becomes completely enraptured, to the point where all her game playing and chaste devotion to fin amor are threatened by her feelings for this man, with whom she spends several days traveling before asking him back to Jardin as an honored guest with the rest of the group. Once he arrives Alyssa immediate recognizes the youth as Amalric VI de Montfort, claimant of the title of Count of Toulouse after his father’s death, and younger brother of Simon de Montfort, the current heir to the de Montfort estates. His mother Alix and father (also Simon) were the greatest enemies the South has faced, and led the Albigensian crusade; Amalric’s father was killed besieging Toulouse, which the family still claim as a possession despite the triumphant return of Raimond VI. Joia believes her Heart’s Desire is the defense of the south, and she is entertaining a young English knight who is a mortal enemy to her cause and all her friends. Strangely, she seems unwilling to take any action against him, though deeply conflicted and now confused. Can the magi save Joia, or even Toulouse, from this random shot of Cupid’s arrow?</div>

<div>Numbers after the slash are modified by stamina in lion form.</div>
<div>Lexora has a -6 Longevity Ritual.</div>
<div>New Spells</div>
<div>Lion of Outlandish Size MuAn 15 R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual (+1 Size) Causes the caster to increase in Size by 1 point, with an increase in Strength of +2, and a reduction in Quickness of –1.. In Lioness form this gives Lexora a Size of +3. Her Strength increases by +2 to +8, and her Quickness falls by 1 to 0. This changes her combat statistics in lioness form to Claws: Init +1, Attack +15, Defense +11, Damage +12, Bite: Init +1, Attack +13, Defense +8 Damage +11. A Size +3 lioness is a terrifying sight, and inspires awe and fear. Her fur appears to become tinted with gold, and in this form she is the size of a war horse. (Base 4, +2 Sun, +1 Size)</div>
<div>The Fur That Turns Blades MuAn 20 R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Individual (+1 Size) This spell causes Lexora’s fur to appear dappled with golden patches, as if in bright sunlight, and it grows warm to the touch. She becomes far more resistant to weapons, teeth or claws, but her fur remains supple, giving +3 protection with no load penalty. She usually casts this before going hunting or if expecting trouble.

<div>Endurance of the Lion ReAn 20 R: Personal, D: Diameter, T: Individual (+1 Size) As Endurance of the Berserkers (ArM5 page134), but works in animal form.

<div>The Lamb Lies Down With the Lion ReAn 30 R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Spectacle Animals seeing the caster become strangely calm, and, unless attacked, act as if she were a harmless creature. Lexora usually casts this while around the covenant to prevent the horses or village livestock being frightened by her, although her Gift still applies to any direct interactions, for example if she approaches an animal. Lexora appears bathed in warm sunlight to anyone who can see her. (Base 4, Sun +2, Spectacle +4)</div>
<div>The Invisible Predator PeMe 30 R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Spectacle The subjects simply disregard the caster of the spell, as if she is not there, their minds altered to remove any thought of her. This spell only works on intelligent creatures; those with Cunning require Animal as the Form. Those affected by Lexora’s spell feel the kiss of the sun on their skin, and at night in particular this may alert them something is wrong. This spell was invented by Androcles, and Lexora rarely uses it owing to the difficulty she has casting it reliably. (Base 4, Sun +2, Spectacle +4, +1 requisite)</div>
<div>The Roar That Induces Terror CrMe 20 R: Personal, D: Diameter, T: Sound The victims of this spell are overcome with a terrible fear of the source of the roar, and attempt to retreat from it. In Lexora’s version, as they hear the roar they also subtly feel the heat of the sun upon their skins. (Base 4, Diameter +1, Spectacle +3)</div>
<div>Aura of Regal Authority ReMe 30 R: Personal, D: Diameter, T: Spectacle Androcles developed this spell, and instils a sense of subservience to authority similar to the deference one might give a king in all who can see the caster. In Lexora’s version, those affected by the spell see her as always illuminated by the sun; during the day, this is literal, but at night Lexora simply looks impressive to them in a way that they naturally describe as being in sunlight.

Within his own Tradition, Xenophanes has advanced to the third station upon the Path of Walking Backwards, The Avenue of Adulation and the Station of Expression, and can use his Enigmatic Wisdom skill to replace Craft: Flower Arranging rolls. See Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults pages 70–71 for a full description of Xenophanes’ Path based abilities. His Silver Cord link to Hypatia gives him some defense against his stupidity, and his nocturnal and somewhat reclusive habits</div>
<div>prevent him being too much of a liability. Hypatia generally keeps him safe and sensible, and he trusts her judgment. Xenophanes’ sigil is a feeling of bliss, a soft emotion that gives gentle pleasure. Even objects effected by his spells seem somehow contented, and those handling them may feel the sigil manifest.</div>

<h3>Beatriz of House Jerbiton</h3>

<div>Beatriz is a broken husk of a maga. After serving her apprenticeship here at the covenant under Joia, she chose to remain despite the fact that the two women despise each other. In 1209 she witnessed the terrible massacre at Beziers, and was one of the very few to escape. In the face of the crusade she felt helpless.

<div>Note that although Lexora still has the Flaw Weak Magic Resistance when in lioness form, it does not apply.</div>
<div>Lexora is holding herself aloof from Joia’s plans, but her determination to wrest control of the covenant from the Jerbiton means that she has an important role to play.</div>
<div>Story Seeds For Lexora</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Pride of Lions</div>
<div>Lexora regards herself as the natural and true leader of Jardin, and heir to the sacred site bequeathed to her by Androcles. She is utterly horrified by Joia’s experiments, and the development of the Faerie aura, and is determined to take over the leadership of the covenant and restore things to their rightful state. The question is how to challenge Joia. She can hardly challenge her to a physical battle, and does not wish to declare a Wizard’s War against a woman with whom she grew up and regards as a sister. She regards Certamen as below her dignity, and she not willing to grovel to the rest of the Council to try to change the political structure and win the leadership by vote after amending the Charter. As such, she has been stymied — until now. She has decided to perform an act so heroic that Joia will resign her leadership as is proper, and accept that she is the real leader of Jardin. While eating the Dauphin and saving the South from a resumed French crusade appeals, Lexora knows</div>
<div>she could not escape Hermetic justice for such an act, so she is seeking an opportunity to do something equally brave and notable, but at least technically legal under the Code. What will this act be?</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Handsome Huntsman</div>
<div>Lexora is out prowling the countryside one day when a pack of hounds pick up her scent and give chase. She can easily outwit them, but during the pursuit she catches a glimpse of the young huntsman, clearly a noble of some means, and judging by his arms a scion of the royal house of Aragon, who also happens to be dazzlingly handsome. Lexora amuses herself by letting him chase her for the day, planning to speak with him after dark, but at some point in the chase her handsome pursuer vanishes, leaving his huntsmen in consternation. Lexora is smitten though, and desperately seeks news of the young man and what strange fate befell him during the chase.</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Return of Panthera</div>
<div>In the early 10th century a Lion Heartbeast Bjornaer named Panthera took control of the pool on the site of Jardin from shapeshifters. Eventually he passed in to Final Twilight here, becoming a Great Beast, and it was the hunt for this sacred Ancestor Site of his forefather that brought Androcles here. Now Panthera is an immense and deadly predator, and like all Great Beasts deeply elusive. Lexora plans to travel to Crintera and learn more of her Ancestor so she can seek the Inner Mysteries of the House by finding him, but what if Panthera, who dedicated his life to defending the pool, returns and discovers the Faerie influence which has arisen? He might be as deadly and cunning a foe. Would he see Lexora as an ally, or as a traitor?</div>

This operates both ways between Hypatia and Xenophanes, and both are able to send complex thoughts, such as images and emotions, to each other. This power has unlimited uses. Speech. Hypatia can speak, and does so frequently, usually in a sardonic manner. She is particularly given to commenting upon what she perceives as others’ stupidity and humans’ lack of personal hygiene. She understands she is not allowed to speak in front of visitors to the covenant unless they wear red caps, however. Xenophanes can withdraw the effect temporarily if necessary; otherwise unlimited. The effect maintains concentration. Powers: Aura of Rightful Authority, 2 points, Penetration 0, Init +2, Mentem, R: Eye D: Sun, T: Individual.

ReMe30 (Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration, +2 Group, 3 Mastery points used to reduce cost, 1 to improve Init.). Appearance: An unremarkable female black cat with a slightly snub nose and green eyes. Hypatia has a slight kink in her tail, and is older and leaner than most of the village cats, but you would have to know her well to recognize her in the dark.</div>
<div>Story Seeds for Xenophanes and Hypatia</div>
<div>Stories about Xenophanes and Hypatia can dwell on their relationship, which has been described by Lexora as the most simply affectionate love she has ever seen. In some way both need the other.</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Dance of Death</div>
<div>When a terrible deadly plague strikes a village just two days’ walk from the covenant, Xenophanes sets out to tend the sick, despite his lack of appropriate skills. He spends silver to hire two Cahors physicians, and watches them bicker over the cause of the strange fever that burns hot for a week, and then culminates in the victim throwing off their covers and dancing frantically through the streets until, unless restrained, they drop dead of exhaustion. Xenophanes realizes what the physicians do not — the strange bird who sings at midnight, the chirping of the crickets, and the skull-shaped rock that looms over the village and is now red with a strange moss tell him that this curse is sent by God for some unforgiven sin that that afflicts the whole community. What is the terrible secret of the community, and how can amends be made?</div>
<div>Story Seed: Sibling Rivalry</div>
<div>Leonarda of Criamon, head of the Covenant of Miniatia Sophia (see later) loathes and detests Xenophanes with an almost pathological passion. She is driven to prove that the whole magical experiment of teaching a fool wisdom was a terrible mistake, and while a Flambeau might simply declare Wizard’s War on her rival, or a Bonisagus critique the false assumptions in the experiment, such is not the Criamon way. Leonarda feels that Xenophanes represents a terrible magical danger, and has become obsessed with</div>
<div>proving this hypothesis. Xenophanes for his part is seemingly oblivious to his magical sister’s hostility, and so when Leonarda begins to send odd gifts, each laden with symbolic significance, to Jardin magi, and to arrive in the middle of the night and dance silently around the Aegis, Xenophanes just shrugs. Leonarda intends to set a bizarre, deeply symbolic and enigmatic trap for Xenophanes to fall into in the hope that he will finally disgrace himself. Unfortunately, the bizarre events, strange omens, and odd characters arriving attract the attention of Hypatia and the other residents of Jardin. Can they puzzle out this trap in the form of a Criamon riddle acted out in reality, or will Xenophanes be humiliated by his rival?</div>
<div>Story Seed: Hypatia’s Lover</div>
<div>Recently Hypatia has started a romantic entanglement with Auranja, the big ginger tom who lives in the stables and belongs to John the Gardener. At first everyone was delighted to see the two cats prowling around together, and it became clear that Auranja is also a magical cat, though his powers are unknown, as he tends to spend most of his time basking in the sun on the stable roof. Unfortunately the romance now takes up more and more of Hypatia’s nights, and while she is still completely loyal to Xenophanes and he is pleased for her, he does appear to be becoming a little jealous, and worse still dangerous, as he does increasingly foolish things without Hypatia to watch over his every move. As his thoughtless magic and bumbling mistakes cause more and more chaos, everyone agrees something must be done — but what?</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Spy in the Undergrowth</div>
<div>Rumors have started to spread about affairs and whispered lover’s secrets spoken by the young nobles whom Joia entertains in the Summer Garden. At first it is suspected that a servant is betraying these trusts, with disastrous effects on both Joia’s reputation and those accused — after all adulteresses can be slain by their cuckolded husbands, and even unwed ladies must jealously maintain the appearance of chastity. Joia’s reputation is soon damaged, and then ladies begin to whisper that she is the traitor to love who has exposed her friends to danger. The real villain is, however, Auranja, who has a power which enables him to walk through the door and enter the regio, and has been spying in the garden before harmlessly gossiping to all the other cats in the region. People say and do things in front of cats they would never do in front of a servant, but unfortunately Tibout, the magical cat companion of the bearded minstrel Izarns, has been giving his master snippets of low gossip he has picked up from talking to other cats.</div>
</div sidebars>


<div sidebars>
<div>failure of that quest finally snapped the already troubled woman; she gained the Flaw: Low Self Esteem, and became Depressed. Her bitterness carries her through, and her resentment against Joia remains. Beatriz has few friends, and seems to want none, but she occasionally takes and discards lovers, in a bitter parody of Joia’s commitment to the fin amor. Beatriz’s sigil manifests as an absence of red. Anything affected by her spells seems to have all the red drained from it. She is incapable of creating true red by magic, though her sigil does allow ruddy skin tones.</div>

<h3>Ahenobarbus of Tremere</h3>

<div>Ahenobarbus is an ambitious Rego specialist. He can deftly enslave people, but has been trained by House Tremere to use indirect effects in case he faces tough magical opponents. His skills in making earthworks and shrouding covenants helps in time of war. He also has leadership skills from studying Tremere military doctrine. In addition to occasionally magically enslaving hedge wizards (which has earned him enemies), he has also dabbled a little in necromancy. He was sent to the Tribunal in 1209 following the destruction of Lariander by the crusade, ostensibly to assist other covenants in maintaining their defenses by misdirection and subtle means, but in fact he is also here owing to Coeris’ suspicion that Protendus (See Faith and Flame:</div>
<div>Aedes Mercurii) is actually incompetent and not acting to defend the best interests of the House and the Order in the Tribunal. He found Jardin in a very exposed position, and has worked hard to improve the defenses, upgrading the grogs’ armor and doing his best to prevent entanglements in mundane politics. His plans, however, have suffered as Joia and Lexora have both tried to draw him into their struggle for the covenant’s leadership. Until such a time as the Order in Provence can assume a position of lordship over mundanes (and that time by his judgment is still decades off) Ahenobarbus is determined to work with the local covenants to help them hide from potential enemies, and avoid interference with both the crusaders and southern lords. Unfortunately his strongest ally is the covenant in Serena the Autocrat, with whom he</div>

She does her best to use the effect whenever she is with other people, however. (Effect: Base 4, +2 Sun, 4 Levels 12 Uses a day)</div>

Beatriz often feels others are hostile to her, and this effect reveals scrying magic up to level 50. She uses it infrequently, but sometimes when out and about the covenant, so if Jardin were being spied upon magically Beatriz would probably be the first to realize and notify the other magi.

<div>has become romantically smitten. He believes she has the best interests of the covenant at heart, and agrees quietly with her that Lexora, as a pagan, and Xenophanes, with his Cathar sympathies, are real threats to the security of the covenant, who should be quietly persuaded to go elsewhere, preferably outside the Tribunal. He regards Joia’s Garden of Love as little more than reckless folly, and has created the Shield of Dismissal as a way to protect the covenant from the constant visitors. Tragically, he has not yet realized the full extent of Serena’s ambitions. Only Beatriz can be relied upon to support Ahenobarbus in any attempt at reform, and she distrusts Serena, which is driving a wedge between them. Ahenobarbus must answer to Protendus of Aedes Mercurii as his regional commander, as ordered by his own parens in Transylvania who still holds his sigil. Yet he has also been tasked with accumulating evidence of Protendus’ incompetence following the disaster at Lariander, and reporting proof thereof back to Coeris so that his parens can challenge Protendus’ supporters politically in the Transylvanian Tribunal. Knowing he is being used as a pawn in his parens’ game, ultimately simply to embarrass political rivals back home, Ahenobarbus has so far tried to avoid reporting for duty, and Protendus has so far not called upon him, but that situation will not last much longer. Ahenobarbus’ sigil manifests as zig zag lines, and even his Circle spells have sharp and jagged edges when viewed by Intellego Vim magics.</div>

<h3>Alyssa, Maga Trianomae</h3>

<div>Alyssa was born into a noble family from the Narbonne region, with whom she still has some contact despite being taken as an apprentice at the age of nine. Alyssa is a cheery soul, quite happy traveling around France and Iberia, trying to sort out local problems and contact Islamic wizards. Her Gentle Gift means she is welcomed when traveling among nobles, and allows her to try to contact non-Hermetic wizards without immediately being hated. Her frequent meddling has caused resentment at a couple of covenants, which has led to a reputation spreading in the Order. She came to Jardin in 1214, following the civil war that had broken out at the covenant of Tolosa Paratge where she had been previously resident. As the most recent arrival, she has little influence on council. Given that her interests lie almost entirely outside the cov</div>

<div>The talisman also has the following attunements: +3 Corpus +4 affect breathing and speaking +4 affect Dead Wood Beatriz is under the influence of a –5 longevity ritual.</div>
<div>Story Seeds for Beatriz</div>
<div>Beatriz is a difficult person to be around, yet despite her depressive yet outspokenly bitter and twisted personality, she is very much a victim of the Garden, and most of the Jardin magi feel sorry for her.</div>
<div>Story Seed: A Stolen Kiss</div>
<div>Every year Beatriz must take a lover to collect the Imaginem vis from her mirror (see Vis Sources, later). Beatriz is incapable of lasting real affection, and although she has many friends among the troubadours men are often put off by her cynicism, dark brooding ways, and often sarcastic manner. When one young man, however, develops strong feelings for Beatriz after their tryst she is at first flattered, and according to Hypatia (who was told by Auranja, who watched while hiding behind a tapestry) she actually smiled once when he sent her a flower and a love poem. After a season of the young man mooching around, however, Beatriz is fed up of his attentions, and even Joia finds him annoying enough to stop trying to steal him away from Beatriz. Beatriz even asks Lexora to eat the young man, but Lexora refuses, saying he would give her indigestion with all that mooning around and sighing. It is clear something must be done. The young man, Jordas is personable enough, but attempts by Joia to change his mind with Mentem magic fail, for no discernible reason, and his passion grows more and more overwhelming and pitiful by the day. Worse still, he is the great nephew of Count Raimond of Toulouse, and was an important rebel commander until he deserted his troops to come and gaze at Beatriz with doe eyes. What is going on, and can he be persuaded to fall for someone else or leave before Beatriz slays him with her shortsword? Or can Beatriz be persuaded to fall in love with him?</div>
<div>Story Seed: Fangs In The Night</div>
<div>In the distant past terrible things happened at Belfort, and the destruction of the Vandal fort and village by a band of rampaging shapeshifters echoes down to the present day. Beatriz has pieced together from hints in ancient manuscripts the story of how the original settlement was destroyed in one horrific night when what appears to have been a large pack of lycanthropes descended upon it. Lexora knows that, when the pool was Magical, before Joia’s Faerie corruption of it, it was sacred to the Bjornaer, and hotly contested with shapeshifting witches. Those witches were allied with Birna’s Pomeranian tradition, and are even now deadly enemies of House Bjornaer. Both suspect the shapeshifters have returned, and seek to drive the faeries and magi away in order to reclaim the site. They fear some of the shapeshifters are already actively trying to infiltrate Belfort de Quercy. Can the conspiracy be unmasked and the shapeshifters be defeated before they massacre the villagers and assault the covenant?</div>
<div>Story Seed: Dreaming Beatriz Back Together Again</div>
<div>Lexora plans to travel to Crintera and there be initiated in the secrets of Clan Maruhs. After pursuing The Deed of Emulation (Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 13) she learns Dream Magic (The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 102) and develops an audacious plan: to create a spell that will allow her and a few trusted friends to enter the sleeping Beatriz’s dreamscape, and there defeat the horrors haunting her and undo the catastrophic results of her failed Heart’s Quest. It will take a few years of study of Imaginem and hard work for Lexora to be ready, but once she is, she plans a nightmare quest into Beatriz’s psyche, and tries to persuade the player characters to accompany her.</div>

<div>Nec is a magnificent huge white she-wolf, who traveled here with Ahenobarbus from the Transylvanian Tribunal. See Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, page 129. Her pride got her in trouble with the pack of white wolves back in Transylvania, and she was willing to join Ahenobarbus to get away from those problems. She is aware that they are unlikely to have gone away completely, however. She does not accept that Ahenobarbus is in any way her superior, and longs to prove herself superior to Lexora’s heartbeast as well.</div>

<h3>Ahenobarbus of Tremere (Cont’d)</h3>

<div>This power has unlimited uses. Appearance: A magnificent white wolf with large eyes, Nec is much larger than non-magical wolves.</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus’ Talisman</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus’ talisman is in the form of a wand with a tip of amber, and a hollow in the handle to contain an Arcane Connection to his laboratory. Total Pawns Invested: 9; Total Effect Levels: 86.</div>
<div>The Touch Of Morpheus ReMe 47 Pen +64, 24/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual Touch Range variant of Call To Slumber as in ArM5, page 151. (Effect: Base 4, +2 Voice, +32 for penetration, +5 for 24 uses/day)</div>

<div>The talisman also has the following attunements: Wand: +4 control things at a distance Amber +3 Corpus</div>
<div>The Collars of Slavery</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus has prepared two of these invested devices, in the form of small iron collars. He keeps one to ensure captives cooperate fully, then have their memory wiped by his spells. He is considering giving the second as a gift to Protendus, to enable them to learn secrets from hedge wizards.</div>
<div>Enslave the Mortal Mind ReMe 44 Pen +0, 2/day, Environmental Trigger R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual</div>
<div>As Enslavement of the Mortal Mind in ArM5, page 152, but with range Touch instead of Eye. The person wearing this small iron collar is completely unable to formulate desires, interests, emotions and activities, and responds willingly to suggestions and commands, as they have no will of their own. Once freed he can fully recall all that transpired while collared and will almost certainly seek revenge.</div>
<div>Story Seeds for Ahenobarbus and Nec</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus and Nec serve House Tremere first, and the covenant second, at least in theory.</div>
<div>His Master’s Voice</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus’ parens is Janus of Tremere (see Against the Dark, page 28), who took Ahenobarbus as an apprentice when he was already 15. As a result the two men are closer in age than common for a parens and filius, and have an almost sibling rivalry. Janus of Tremere is the Secretary for Contingencies for House Tremere, developing plans for various unlikely scenarios that could, but probably won’t, happen, and as such he often asks Ahenobarbus to undertake duties on behalf of the House. Janus thoroughly approves of Ahenobarbus somehow persuading his Jardin sodales to assist in the plans, as long as they do not realize they are following a Tremere agenda. Some possible examples are:</div>
<div>Plan Black Olive: What if the Cathar Church becomes established and replaces the Church as the established religion of Southern Europe? Janus wants to know more about the secretive leaders of each of the relatively new dioceses of the Cathar Church, and if possible gain leverage over them so that the Order can negotiate from a position of strength if the Church’s attempt to suppress the heresy fails. He asks Ahenobarbus to find out the time and place of each bishop’s birth, collect Arcane Connections if possible, and also learn any moral failings or dark secrets these men have, just in case. Plan Gold Olive: Janus thinks it likely the Crusade will exterminate Catharism, and that stories of the secret treasure of the Cathars are nonsense. However, recently the Cathars have started to fortify a fortress called Montsegur in the Pyrenees, access to which is almost impossible for non-Cathars. Janus asks Ahenobarbus to find out the secret of Montsegur, what the Cathar treasure is, if it even exists, and to work out a plan to take Montsegur both magically and also with mundane forces, just in case it ever becomes necessary for the good of House Tremere. Plan Faded Rose: Jardin amuses Janus, who does not believe it poses any kind of threat to House Tremere’s plans.</div>
<div>Nonetheless it is standard practice to ask Tremere members of a covenant to work out a plan to quickly take their home if necessary, to detail the weaknesses of both the physical and magical defenses, and to find useful leverage on the individuals within, just in case. Of course such an act can be seen as treachery, and Janus is astute enough to realize Ahenobarbus might lie if he has “gone native”. The story here is mainly about how Ahenobarbus responds to such a request, his moral choices, and whether the agent sent covertly by Janus to see if Ahenobarbus is loyal and has reported honestly can be detected and deceived if necessary. Plan Lost Children: Janus had a friend, Diocletian, who died in the massacre at Lariander (see Faith and Flame). While it is not part of his official duties, Janus is unhappy about House Tremere’s official investigation of the fall of Lariander, and wants Ahenobarbus to investigate the site, speak with any survivors, including Garsenda, the one maga who escaped, and try to work out what really happened that night. In particular, he wants to know if treachery was involved. Plan Buried Talents: Janus sends a chest containing 30 pawns of assorted vis to Ahenobarbus, and asks him to utilize it to further the House’s interests, and report back after seven years on how he has profited House Tremere by his actions with the vis. This is a severe test, for Ahenobarbus must be able to show that he has used it wisely and well and actually achieved something measurable. What, though? Plan Mountain Witch: Janus has found evidence that a powerful coven of Sorginak (Basque witches, see Faith and Flame) have captured some important documents belonging to a House Tremere operative in Iberia, and a Redcap. He wants Ahenobarbus to hunt down the coven leader, and return her and the documents to Coeris for safekeeping. He also wants Ahenobarbus to ensure that the remaining Sorginak become Tremere allies rather than a potential menace. Plan High Mercury: Janus has long suspected that Protendus, Exarch for Tremere in the region, is actually a traitor who is betraying House secrets to the Cult of Mercury at his home covenant of Aedes Mercurii. Janus wants clear evidence of wrongdoing, for he fears that Protendus’ links with the Cult of Mercury are angering parts of House Flambeau, including Primus Garus</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>enant (in particular, seeking a reconciliation between the Hermetic Cathars and their enemies at Toulouse), she has paid little heed to the growing tensions within her new home, and usually votes on council to support Xenophanes on any given issue. She is fully aware he is not at all bright, but she has a soft spot for exotic magi and those from unusual backgrounds, and, like Xenophanes, has much sympathy for the Cathar faith. She has little time for Ahenobarbus because of his relationship with Serena, whom she actively dislikes for her cruelty to the covenfolk, but a great deal of respect for Lexora. Indeed, she might well back the Bjornaer in a leadership bid against Joia. Ultimately Alyssa’s aim is to ensure peace and stability for the covenant, and avoid any conflicts. She has seen only too clearly where that can lead. Alyssa’s sigil manifests as the smell of goat’s cheese.</div>

<h3>Notable Covenfolk</h3>

<div>Some of the most important of the mundane inhabitants of Jardin are described here, but the troupe should supplement them to develop their own themes.</div>

<h3>Companions</h3>

<div>Only one of the companions associated with Jardin is detailed here. The others include a Jewish banker from Cahors, a romantic troubadour enraptured with Joia, and a dispossessed knight (a faidit) who has taken to little more than banditry in opposition to the Crusade, who often escapes his pursuers by hiding within the covenant walls.</div>
<div>Serena Montdumerc, the Other Lady of Jardin</div>
<div>The niece of Joia, Serena is the last of the Montdumerc line and heir to the title of lady of Jardin once her aunt Joia dies. She serves as the covenant autocrat, and takes out her frustration at being little more than a glorified servant to the magi upon the covenfolk.</div>

<h3>Ahenobarbus of Tremere (Cont’d)</h3>

<div>and his militites, upon whom House Tremere would rely in the event of a House Tytalus attack.</div>
<div>The Wolves in the Woods</div>
<div>Nec has become the leader of a small pack of wolves who originated in the mountains to the west of the covenant, but who now prowl the woods and open lands around Belfort. Under Nec’s leadership they have kept a low profile, and act as a spy network for Ahenobarbus, watching travelers on the road and reporting strangers in their territory. The villagers of Belfort have come to regard them as quite tame, and on occasion the wolves have</div>
<div>helped villagers who have been attacked by bandits or suffered accidents far from home. Nec is now regarded around the village as a sort of large friendly dog, but her pack, while considered harmless, stay in the wilds. This changes when savage attacks by wolves on travelers and even village farmers cause terror among the covenfolk and villagers, and Nec’s pack come to be regarded with terror, and Nec with suspicion. The villagers demand the magi do something, or send Nec and Ahenobarbus away. Beatriz suspects the shapeshifters with whom she is obsessed, but the truth is simpler. The real killer is Galhart, a friendly miller who keeps the waterwheel on the stream a few miles from Belfort, and who every night takes on the form of a wolf</div>
<div>following a faerie’s curse. Unfortunately, Galhart has no control over his behavior in lupine form. Nec has been pursuing a passionate affair with this handsome wolf, and half suspects the truth. She has been hiding the concerns of her pack about a strange wolf in their territory from the magi, sure that she can handle the issue if necessary. If the curse is lifted Galhart and Nec still have strong feelings for each other, but are stuck as different species. Can the magi help with this problem?.</div>

<div>She is vain, and bitterly resents Joia’s beauty. Her threats of horrible punishments and abuse of the covenfolk have tuned many against her, but few dare stand up to her. Recently she has moved into the tower, where she possesses rooms on the ground floor, and has a troubled relationship with Ahenobarbus. She likes to think she plans to use him as a pawn in her revenge, and she feels she could never truly love a magus, but the affection between the two is genuine.</div>
<div>Serena costs 6 build points.</div>

<h3>Grogs</h3>

<div>The grogs of Jardin are drawn from the village of Belfort, and few of them have much military experience. Despite Rosamonde, the turb leader’s, best efforts, and Ahenobarbus’ attempt to instill some degree of discipline and improve their arms and armor, they are a rather hapless collection of eccentrics. Three wear partial leather, carry bows, shield and a short spear, and serve as scouts, and three</div>
<div>have partial scale, poleaxes and daggers, and serve primarily as shield grogs.</div>
<div>Rosamonde Unaud, Turb Captain</div>
<div>Rosamonde leads the turb. Now in her forties, Rosamonde is deeply troubled by arthritis and is slowing up, but is unwilling to relinquish command just yet, in the absence of an obvious female successor among the grogs. She prefers not to leave her home now, and never travels more than a day from the covenant.</div>
<div>Rosamonde costs 8 build points.</div>

<h3>Specialists and Other Covenfolk</h3>

<div>A number of specialists and servants complete the staff of the covenant.</div>
<div>Specialists</div>
<div>John the Gardener is an attractive young man of 27, with an eye for the ladies. Always cheerful, he works hard to maintain the gardens in good order, and if he has one fault it is that he treats the magi as his equals, and fears no one. Serena has a soft spot for him, and leaves him alone. His Abilities are: Animal Handling 2 (mules), Athletics 2 (contortions), Awareness 1 (unusual plants), Bargain 1 (plants), Brawl 2 (Fist), Carouse 1 (seduction of betters), Charm 1 (female magi), Craft: Gardener 5 (topiary), Craft: Winemaking 4 (black wines), Etiquette 2 (magi), Folk Ken 1(covenfolk), Latin 4 (speaking to magi), Leadership 1 (in gardens), Occitan 5 (gardening terms), Organization Lore: Jardin 2 (gardens), Profession: Viticulturist 4, Teaching 3, and Swim 2 (diving). His Communication is +2, and he costs 5 build points. Bohella the Librarian (aged 52) is an elderly woman who has served the covenant well for twenty five years now. Her knowledge of the covenant’s history is better than anyone but Joia and Lexora’s, and she has Profession: Librarian 9 (preserve books) and Organization Lore: Jardin</div>

<h3>Alyssa, Maga Trianomae (Cont’d)</h3>

<div>Story Seeds for Alyssa and Fauconrouge</div>
<div>Alyssa’s past and current wanderings are perfect for drawing the covenant into stories.</div>
<div>Story Seed: Guerrilla Warfare</div>
<div>Alyssa is from Paratge Tolosa, the ancient and cultured Toulouse covenant now immersed in a violent civil war and magical siege. The Cathar sympathizers (Black faction) are trapped within their island regio, while their White rivals control the streets of the town. Alyssa has for some time now been raiding the Whites’ vis sources, attempting to deprive them of magical resources. This is a flagrant violation of the Code, given that she has now joined Jardin and no longer has any right to those resources. With the thirty or more pawns of vis she has stockpiled as an incentive, Alyssa seeks magi who are willing to declare a Wizard’s War against the White leader, the charismatic but young magus Carolus St. Tropez. She has also taken to conducting harassing operations against Carolus, Adam Carpentiere and the other White faction magi. While she tries to keep her activities secret, she is actively looking for recruits who are open to participating in the magical civil war that rages</div>
<div>in the city, and who can enter, raid the besiegers’ positions, and then retreat again, leaving no traces for any Quaesitorial investigation to uncover.</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Curse of Venus</div>
<div>It is notable that every time Alyssa has had a chance to kill or utterly defeat Carolus St. Tropez, leader of the White faction of the Tolosa Paratge magi, she has allowed him to escape, despite his youth and relative lack of magical prowess. The dashing Carolus suffers from the Flaw Curse of Venus, and inevitably Alyssa has fallen in love with him. She wishes to save him from his “bad friends” and poor choices. She hatches a plan, convinced that Carolus is secretly in love with her too, to kidnap him from Castle Pujol and bring him back to Jardin, where she hopes he will quest for his Heart’s Desire and find it is actually Alyssa. To this end she needs friends who will help her capture Carolus unharmed, bring him home, and then somehow smuggle him in to the Night Garden, all without Joia’s consent. This plan is typical of Alyssa, who can never see any situation or argument develop without firmly believing that it will be greatly improved by her personal intervention. Unfortunately, Carolus</div>
<div>is well aware that Alyssa is an enemy who has been conducting a series of raids on his vis stores and fomenting magical warfare on the streets of Toulouse against his men. Given the paranoia involved in his successfully conducting the siege of Paratge Tolosa the raid will be dangerous and difficult, as Castle Pujol is defended with many magical traps.</div>
<div>Story Seed: A Hint of Lavender</div>
<div>Fauconrouge converses with other hawks from time to time, and has recently learned that the Isles d’ Yf have become home to a group of Muslim wizards, seemingly practicing Hermetic magic. The region was for centuries blighted by the rogue Moorish covenant known as Fraxinetum, who were defeated by the alliance that became the Coenobium (see Faith and Flame: The Provençal Tribunal). Whoever these secretive Moorish magi may be, Alyssa is determined to seek them out in her role as a maga Trianomae, and help them gain official recognition as a Provençal covenant. It has not occurred to her yet that neither they, House Flambeau, nor the powerful federation of covenants called the Coenobium may fully appreciate her plans, and that she is rushing headlong in to a potentially dangerous situation.</div>

<div>8 (history) among her many Abilities. Her Communication is +3. and she costs 9 build points. Sicart the Scribe is responsible for preparing inks, vellum, and book binding, and teaching magi and apprentices Profession: Scribe. Now 48 years old, he was once a grog, and before that a tinker, and is never far from his trusty pots and pans, in which he mixes inks. Notoriously short-sighted, he has Communication +1, Teaching 4 (apprentices) and Profession: Scribe 6 (copying). He costs 11 build points.</div>
<div>Servants</div>
<div>The servants are efficient, courteous and clean. They serve dutifully, and a position at the covenant is highly valued by the inhabitants of Belfort, but Serena’s threats of punishment and terrible rages have recently caused a loss of morale, and some resentment.</div>

<h3>Covenant Organization</h3>

<div>The covenant is ruled by a Council of Magi, with no real positions or titles. While everyone has one vote, Joia has nominal leadership based upon her family claim to Jardin and her personal charm.</div>
<div>Hierarchy and Governance</div>
<div>Jardin is ruled by a Council of Magi. The Council meets at least once a season, in the Council Chamber in the library, and makes rulings regarding matters of external relations, listens to a report from Serena the autocrat, and votes on special expenditures of vis, as well as approving plans for seasons of covenant service (see below). The Council employs a system of precedence, with the First Maga being the person who first became resident at covenant. Relatively young magi apprenticed at the covenant therefore often wield more influence than much older and more powerful magi, as the date is taken from the time they were first resident, not from the date of Gauntlet. Precedence is used in the selection of vis from the stocks, selection of books in the library for study, and allocation of mundane and magical resources, with the First Maga choosing first and so on. The magi are presented above in order of precedence.</div>

<h3>Life at Jardin</h3>

<div>Life at Jardin is generally sleepy, some would say idyllic, but the struggle for leadership between Joia, Lexora, and Serena has a subtle impact on almost every aspect of day to day life. It is somehow assumed that women will always rule here, and no one, not even Ahenobarbus, has ever seriously questioned this fact. It may be related to the very magic of the place.</div>
<div>The Charter</div>
<div>The Provençal Tribunal is unusual in that by the Peripheral Code a covenant charter, once accepted and sworn to, is a legal obligation, and breaking the charter can and has been prosecuted as a Low Crime at Tribunal. This makes the stipulations of the charter of even more importance than in many Tribunals, as outsiders can be asked to rule on whether if it is upheld, rather than this being a purely internal matter. Each maga of Jardin is expected to spend one season a year in the service of the covenant. What is acceptable service varies upon perceived needs. New suggestions for types of service must be approved by a Council vote, and such approval may be subsequently be withdrawn by a second Council vote. At the moment the following are acceptable as covenant service and no new vote is required, simply the declaration</div>

<h3>Story Seed: No More Gardening?</h3>

<div>Lexora has long opposed Joia’s expenditure of covenant resources and time on the Garden of Love, but Xenophanes is a strong supporter, and Ahenobarbus is influenced by Serena to maintain the project. If Lexora can find support on Council to rule that tending the garden is no longer acceptable as covenant service, the time Joia and Xenophanes can spend gardening diminishes, and the Garden grows wild and untended. Strange effects begin to arise as neglected love alters the covenant aura, and romances between covenfolk break down acrimoniously. The inhabitants of the regio become even more wild and dangerous, and occasionally emerge to set things right, or perhaps the regio slowly becomes increasingly hard to access. Hatred and open conflict in the covenant increase as love turns sour. In the long run the aura will revert to Magic, but in the short term the thwarted faeries will seek vengeance.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>that of what service will be performed that year.  • Writing Laboratory Texts for the library • Writing tractatus or summae for the library • Copying any of the aforementioned for trading with other covenants to enrich the library • Making enchanted devices for the benefit of the covenant, vineyards or gardens • Maintaining the gardens or vineyards • Making a longevity ritual for one’s self • Setting up a new laboratory • Extracting vis or collecting vis for the stocks, the latter only if it takes more than ten days • Training an apprentice • Teaching spells, Arts or Abilities to other magi or covenfolk</div>
<div>By tradition a maga may choose to not perform covenant service in any given year, but is then expected to donate back the vis she would otherwise be entitled to. In reality she is simply assigned no vis. Only Lexora has commonly chosen to do this. Each maga in good standing receives four pawns of vis a year, in addition to any vis required for making enchanted devices for the covenant under the terms of covenant service. She is afforded the protection of the Aegis</div>
<div>and grogs, access to the library, and the sum of five pounds of silver a year to dispose of however she may wish. Newly gauntleted apprentices from the covenant who choose to leave to establish a new covenant are by tradition granted one pawn of vis per year they were trained at Jardin, the sum of fifty pounds of silver, and up to two years free copying rights in the Library to help them establish their new home. This does not apply if they leave to join an existing covenant, however. In addition to covenant service, Jardin expects resident magae to assist in the collection of the vis sources and if present participate in Council meetings. The covenant charter also explicitly requires magae to obey the Code of Hermes and specifies that any maga convicted of a Low Crime by a lawfully constituted Tribunal will be asked to leave the covenant. So far, this has never occurred, and if it did there would be considerable controversy, especially if it was believed by most of the magae that the judgment was unfair or the offense slight. A recent addition to the covenant charter brought in only last year in the light of the situation at Tolosa Paratge requires that magae swear to never declare Wizard’s War on a fellow covenant member, or use Certamen to overturn a ruling agreed by Council. While the Council passed the item (with Ahenobarbus and Lexora</div>
<div>opposing), it was agreed that these provisions do not apply to those who have already sworn the covenant charter, and thus currently apply to none of the inhabitants of the covenant.</div>

<h3>Covenant Buildings</h3>

<div>The ancient walls of the fort are crumbling, but the structures within are in good repair.</div>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<div>The beautiful gardens of Jardin make the covenant a blaze of color, a perfumed paradise of subtle scents and astonishing beauty. Everything is well tended, and the garden is a pale echo of lost Eden.</div>

<h3>Main Structures</h3>

<div>The map of the covenant shows the layout of the buildings. All are within the protection of the dilapidated walls of the ancient fortress.</div>
<div>The Library</div>
<div>The library building is an impressive three story red brick structure with a shining copper dome, clearly visible from the road below over the walls of the Visigothic fort. The layout and contents are described in detail later.</div>
<div>The Tower</div>
<div>The tower has four floors, linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor is Serena’s quarters, and a small guard chamber just inside the main doors. Stairs lead up to Beatriz’s laboratory, and from there to the third floor which is Joia’s sanctum. Finally, the top floor is Joia’s laboratory.</div>
<div>The Guesthouse</div>
<div>Once the manor house of the Montdumerc family, this building is a three floor red brick town house of a style not dissimilar to those of the prosperous merchants of Cahors. Serena maintains rooms here to entertain guests, but mainly it is used as a guest house with the upper floors providing four large sleeping rooms for important visitors. The top floor is divided in two, the sanctums of Alyssa and Ahenobarbus.</div>
<div>The Kitchen</div>
<div>The brick built kitchen doubles as a bakehouse, and is carefully watched as a fire risk. Food is prepared here and served in the guesthouse hall or in the sancta of magae as they prefer. Lexora never eats publicly, and Xenophanes very rarely joins the table.</div>
<div>The Laboratories</div>
<div>Joia and Beatriz maintain laboratories in the tower, but the laboratories of the other magi are stone buildings built against the walls of the fortress. All are described later.</div>
<div>The Gardens</div>
<div>The whole of the fortress’ interior is laid out as beautiful gardens, with lawns and sandy paths, and even a fountain playing. The Faerie aura makes the garden seem intensely vibrant and even more beautiful than it would be otherwise, and on a summer’s day it takes the breath away, seeming like a paradise on Earth. Only clergy are immune to its charm, for they recall all too well how the Garden of Eden led to death and misery when woman tempted man for the first time. Strange talking animals and butterflies that change color with the emotions of those resting here are often glimpsed within its walls.</div>
<div>The Bower</div>
<div>One corner of the fort is filled with wild roses, which grow in tangled heaps over jumbled rocks, and a few leafy trees, and this spot, popular with lovers, is known as the bower. Joia likes to sit here and sew on a mossy rock, awaiting her lovers.</div>
<div>The Door Marked Summer</div>
<div>In the wall of the fort is a peculiar door, built in to the thickness of the ancient stone. Painted sky blue, if a character looks at it</div>
<div>through the corner of her eye it seems to open into a beautiful garden in the height of summer, regardless of the time of day or season. This is the entrance to the first level of the regio and is always kept locked. Only a true lover, as judged by Joia, will be allowed to pass through, and Joia carries the key at all times. Those deemed worthy are allowed to enter the Garden of Love, and undertake the quest for their heart’s desire.</div>

<h3>The Garden of Love</h3>

<div>The Garden of Love is a powerful Faerie regio, shaped by the dreams of the magi, the plans of Joia, and hard work and mundane craftsmanship. Its deeper levels are dangerous, and sometimes frightening, and the magi rarely go there. Even Joia knows little of its mysteries or inhabitants.</div>
<div>The Summer Garden (Regio, Faerie Aura 5)</div>
<div>Crossing over into the regio takes characters to a level 5 Faerie aura. While still apparently on the ridge, it now appears that they are in a fabulous walled garden that mirrors the fortress just left behind in general layout. Where the library stands in the mundane world is a great pool of water. The location</div>
<div>of the tower holds a maze of dark and rustling hedges, and overhead the sun blazes upon a beautiful summer garden filled with avenues of shady trees, statues of classical goddesses, and beautiful flowers and shrubs. Troubadours favored by Joia are occasionally invited to recite and sing for selected guests here at some of Joia’s famous entertainments, and magic is openly used by her to dazzle the guests senses and fill their hearts with joy. The bower still exists, but in a mirrored position, and now it is deeper, and more mysterious.</div>
<div>The Pool</div>
<div>No longer present in the mundane world, the pool is a powerful initiatory site for Bjornaer magi with sanguine Heartbeasts. The moss-covered rocks around the pool contain strange Visigothic magic relating to an ancient shapechanging tradition, and this is also a holy site for many shapechangers.</div>
<div>The Maze</div>
<div>The maze is a proper maze, not a labyrinth, and leads to the next level of the regio. Hedge mazes have only just come into fashion, and this maze, created by Xenophanes with exquisite topiary, guards the entrance to the dangerous Night Garden. While the Garden of Love’s outer Summer regio is a place of joy and idleness, the Night Garden contains the secrets of the heart, and only those Joia considers ready for the quest to find their Heart’s Desire (and some unfortunate grogs and covenfolk sent to gather vis) are ever allowed to enter. The center of the maze is a tree with beautiful shining fruit, but there is</div>
<div>no mundane way to reach it, and even if the fruit were somehow attained it is a deadly poison. The way to pass on to the next level is simply to become lost within the maze.</div>
<div>The Night Garden (Regio, Faerie Aura 7)</div>
<div>Overhead a full moon stands high in a balmy summer night sky. A gentle breeze seems to whisper soft secrets, and caress the skin; all around the garden rustles with life, but furtive, secret life. Dark eerie shadows are cast by the trees — the night garden is a frightening place. Emerging from the maze, the walls seem distant, further away than in the previous level, and it is impossible to see far, so tangled and wild are the briars and trees. All around is lush vegetation, and paths that wind among great moss-covered rocks, through grassy clearings filled with bluebells, and by tiny brooks that flow nowhere and end in deep, perhaps bottomless, pools. Wandering through the Night Garden brings one to all kinds of exotic flowers, plants and strange sights. None of these are created or tended by the magi, who avoid entering this level of the regio as far as possible. Magical monsters and strange beings live here, and they can be deadly, although they are shy and rarely encountered. These beings are often allegorical representations of the personality flaws, fears and problems that separate the quester from her Heart’s Desire, but very few are self aware enough to realize this. Because the inhabitants vary so much, taking on forms appropriate to the</div>
<div>quester, they are not detailed here, but several must be overcome by anyone questing for their Heart’s Desire, and the storyguide should create appropriate challenges.</div>
<div>The Lake</div>
<div>The path to the lake can only be found by those seeking their Heart’s Desire. No one who has attempted the quest and failed, or completed it before, can ever find their way back again. Those who qualify, however, eventually stumble upon the Lake. The pool on this level becomes a great lake of black water. No fish swim in it, no ripples disturb it. Across the lake on an island can be seen the bower, and it is there that one can find the secret of one’s Heart’s Desire. Anyone foolhardy enough to enter the lake itself finds only inky blackness and a few have been forever lost, drowned in the depths. A small boat is moored nearby, and can be used to cross the lake using the paddle within, but it is only large enough for one character at a time, regardless of their Size. Attempts to fly over, swim across, or use magic to cross over to the other shore work (although the character is still attacked as soon as they land on the island – see later), but characters find themselves completely alone, even if they crossed with others. While crossing the lake the character is suddenly lost to sight in mist, and attacked by her own emotions. Only characters with the Virtue True Love succeed automatically in the crossing, and they have no need to quest for their Heart’s Desire, for they have found it already. Losing the fight, or being wounded, has grave consequences. Once the monster</div>
<div>is defeated, or the quester Incapacitated or Dead, or has somehow fled the garden, the consequences of wounds she has suffered in the fight must be assessed.</div>
<div>• If Dead, she is just that, and is never seen again, perhaps drowned in the lake. • If Incapacitated she awakens in the Garden of Love, but suffers a Major Flaw or two Minor Flaws representing her utter loss of self-respect and any hope of obtaining what she seeks: perhaps she realizes she has already possessed her Heart’s Desire, and lost it. Suitable Flaws include but are not limited to Curse of Venus, Fury, Low Self-Esteem, or Lost Love; or two Minor Flaws from Compulsion, Delusion, Depressed, Obsessed, Oversensitive, Pessimistic, Weakness, Weak Willed, or Wrathful. Her Personality Traits should be adjusted to reflect the character’s new, darker, perspective on life. • If her worst wound was a Heavy Wound, but she defeated her emotions, she emerges on the island’s shore, and finds herself</div>
<div>able to enter The Bower of Your Heart’s Desire. Regardless of the number of such wounds suffered, she receives one new Minor Personality Flaw, freely chosen by the player to represent the character’s insights. If the Personality Trait she fought was a Flaw, she replaces that Flaw with the new Personality Flaw: a Major becomes a Major, a Minor, a Minor. It may not be the same Flaw she defeated. • If her worst wound was a Medium Wound, but she defeated her emotions, she emerges on the island’s shore, and finds herself able to enter The Bower of Your Heart’s Desire. She gains a Confidence Point, and may remove any Flaw the Personality Trait she defeated was based upon, and reassign Personality Traits as required. • If the worst wound received was a Light Wound, the character removes the Flaw (as for a Medium Wound) if applicable, and gains 3 Confidence Points. She arrives on the shore and proceeds to The Bower of Your Heart’s Desire. The player should adjust her Personality Trait</div>
<div>values to reflect her new insights. • If the character faced off her fears without being wounded in any way, she gains the Virtue Self Confident (and grogs gain a Confidence Score of 1) and arrives on the shore and proceeds to The Bower of Your Heart’s Desire. The player should adjust her Personality Trait values to reflect her new insights.</div>
<div>The Bower of Your Heart’s Desire</div>
<div>If a quester succeeds in overcoming all challenges, she finds herself on the shore of the island, and recognizes the woods in front of her as the bower from the Garden of Love. There a pale maiden awaits her, garbed in noble dress, and she kisses her once before whispering the secret of her Heart’s Desire. The character then awakes in the bower in the Garden of Love, and a changed person sets out with new purpose to re-enter life. She now knows the one thing her life is intended for, and most questers set out to achieve it.</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Fighting One’s Emotions</h3>

<div>First, it is important for the player to decide which of his character’s Personality Traits is most likely to be an obstacle to the discovery of her Heart’s Desire. If the character has no Personality Trait that can be categorized as a suitable emotion, she finds herself instead assaulted by Reason, an embodiment of how rationality is defending her from Love, and you should substitute Intelligence for the personality trait in calculating her opponent’s statistics. The figure who attacks her on the lake is an allegorical personification of her resistance to Love, so no description can be given. Her wrath may be a knight in red armor, lust a fearsome succubus, or envy a green eyed monster. Whatever the appearance, the creature has combat statistics calculated as follows</div>
<div>Initiative (equal to Personality Trait) Attack (Personality Trait times 3) Defense (9+Personality Trait) Damage (equal to Personality Trait) and Soak (Personality Trait +1) It has no Fatigue Levels, and Body Levels OK, 0 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11–15), Dead (16+). The creature has a Faerie Might of 50. A normal combat is fought, and while spells can be cast this is a fierce hand-tohand struggle, though any weapon or enchanted device carried can be employed. However, while normal combat statistics for the weapon employed are used, the weapon Ability score is not. Substitute any appropri</div>
<div>ate Ability, Virtue or personality trait that can be used to oppose the attacking emotion; this Ability can be employed as if it were the relevant weapon Ability. Minor Virtues grant an Ability of 3 for calculating combat totals, Major Virtues 9. Armor provides no Protection here, but Soak does, and shields can be employed as normal to boost Defense totals. Example: Beatriz fought her own stubbornness in the form of a magical mule here. It ran across the lake and tried to kick her from the boat. At the time her stubbornness was at +3, so the Mule looked like this Init +3 Atk +9 Def +12 Damage +3 Soak +4 Beatriz had brought her sword, in which she is unskilled, and her usual combat totals are Sword, Init +1, Attack +1, Defense +1, Damage +6. She considered using her Strong Willed Minor Virtue to add 3 to Attack and Defense, but the storyguide ruled that was little use against her stubbornness. None of her Abilities seemed appropriate to substitute for Single Weapon, so she argued that her Minor Magical Focus (changing own appearance) showed she could change her mind and overcome her stubbornness, and this was accepted. A minor virtue grants a “Single Weapon” ability of 3, so her final statistics were Init +1, Attack +4, Defense +4, Damage +6. Despite using her Confidence points she lost the battle, and suffered the loss of her self esteem, resulting in Beatriz as we know her today.</div>

<h3>Attaining Your Heart’s Desire</h3>

<div>The discovery of her Heart’s Desire changes a character radically. While those who emerge dangerously mad or obsessed are sometimes helped by the Perdo Mentem magics of the magi to make them forget what they have learned, most are positively changed. Characters Tainted with Evil or linked to the Infernal Realm may find ghastly secrets, and usually become dangerous, although some find the inner strength to overcome this evil; everyone else simply finds the one thing they always cared about. This is a decision for the character’s player, as it will shape the character, and may be as grandiose as “To Conquer the World!” (granting a Major Personality Flaw of Obsession) or as simple as “to be happy”, which might grant the Personality Flaw Carefree. A new Virtue or even Flaw may be granted to reflect the character’s change in perspective, for this is essentially a non-Hermetic initiatory quest analogous to those practiced by the Mystery Houses or Esoteric Mystery Cults (see The Mysteries Revised Edition). No more than one Virtue should be granted, and in some cases none, merely a new direction in life, but the discovery of one’s Heart’s Desire should mark a new chapter in the character’s story. Whether this is a real expression of the character’s Heart Desire, or some subtle faerie ploy, is unknown to the magi.</div>

<h3>Laboratories</h3>

<div>Jardin has eight laboratories, with six currently in use. Some of the magi have customized their laboratories in certain ways. Full details are given at the end of each laboratory’s description using the rules given in Covenants, but if your troupe is not using that book the following descriptions detail all the bonuses and penalties the maga gains from her laboratory. If you wish to add more magi to Jardin, but not remove any of the existing characters, the two spare laboratories are assigned first (see The Guest Laboratories later). Another similar building is currently used for storage and can be adapted with two seasons’ work to house a third magus, and the stables could also be converted if need be to allow a fourth, but new stables would have to be constructed outside the walls of the fort, probably in the village. However, it is more likely that the Council would draw the line at nine laboratories for expense reasons, and demand that new magi share laboratory space, using the same laboratory in different seasons. Such a situation is filled with potential for conflict and stories. It is quite possible that Alyssa would allow her laboratory to be used while she is away traveling, and this may ease the problem a little, but would place the maga in question in her debt.</div>
<div>Joia du Lua’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Characteristics: Refinement +3, Size:+0 Virtues/Flaws: Elevated, Highly Organized, Superior Construction; Lesser Feature (Lofty Ceiling), Lesser Feature (Window), Potted Plants. General Quality +1, Upkeep +1, Safety +4, Warping 0, Health 0, Aesthetics +5, Bonuses: +3 Auram, +1 Herbam.  Cost: 30 BP</div>
<div>On the top floor of the tower, Joia’s laboratory has a commanding view from its magnificent glazed window, through which one can clearly see the Garden of Love. Overhead is the dome of the tower, and within the laboratory the brightly painted and beautifully carved wooden beams in the very high ceiling add to the feeling of space and airiness. When entering the lab for the first time one is almost overwhelmed by the heady perfume of flowers; potted plants are everywhere, and the room is a beautiful riot of bright color from the hundreds of gorgeous flowers. Despite this profusion of plants and magically created blooms, the work space is immaculately organized, and everything has its place clearly set out. The room is 500 square feet</div>
<div>in floor area, being a circular room 25 feet across. Joia’s lab reduces her botch dice for work here by four dice, and grants a +1 bonus to her Laboratory Totals, and additional bonuses of +3 to Auram and +1 to Herbam totals. The laboratory belonged to Humbert de Cavirac before his death, but Joia has renovated it and made it her own.</div>
<div>Lexora’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Characteristics: Refinement +2, Size +0 Virtues/Flaws: Highly Organized, Lesser Feature (Animal Pen), Menagerie; Dirty. General Quality:+1, Upkeep +1, Safety +1 Warping 0, Health –1, Aesthetics –2, Bonuses: +1 Perdo, +3 Animal  Cost: 20 BP</div>
<div>Lexora’s laboratory is filthy, but given the animals she keeps within it that is little surprise. It is in one of the stone buildings that line the inside of the fort’s walls, and you can smell it before you open the door. Inside, birds fly around the rafters, cats and dogs compete for space by the fireplace, and there is even a small pond, which is home to brightly colored fish and amphibians. The buzz of insects, the fetid smell of urine and excrement, and the occasional fight between two residents all add to the apparent confusion, which is just how Lexora likes it. The maga knows every inch of her territory, and the animals respect, or perhaps fear, her, and stay out of the way when she is working. What to others appears like chaos is in fact a highly organized workspace for the Bjornaer maga. There is a carefully designed animal pen to hold recalcitrant subjects, and Lexora has in the past had wolves, boars, and even a stag as ‘house guests’ in the laboratory, though she rarely denies them their freedom for long. Unfortunately the conditions are so unpleasant that Lexora’s health suffers as a result; she has a –1 penalty on Recovery rolls in any year where she spends two seasons working here. However, this unusual workspace grants +1 to Lab Totals, and additional bonuses of +3 to Animal and +1 to Perdo Laboratory Totals. Lexora knows her laboratory so well she has one fewer botch dice on rolls here.</div>
<div>Xenophanes’ Laboratory</div>
<div>Characteristics: Refinement +1, Size +0 Virtues/Flaws: Living Quarters. General Quality +1, Upkeep 0, Safety 0, Warping 0, Health –2, Aesthetics –2  Cost: 10 BP</div>
<div>Housed in one of the stone buildings that line the fort’s walls, Xenophanes laboratory is rather austere, and he chooses to live within it. His simple straw sleeping mat, meager possessions and a single wooden stool lie in a corner, often with discarded bowls from his last meal, though he is scrupulous in emptying his chamber pot before inviting the very rare guest into his sanctum. Living in one’s laboratory is far from ideal, but for some reason Xenophanes insists upon it. He receives a +1 bonus to Laboratory Totals despite the inconvenience of having the same living and work space, but the effects on his health are severe. He receives –2 to all Recovery rolls and a –1 penalty to his to Aging rolls.</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus’ Laboratory</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus has a lab in the building between those of Xenophanes and Lexora. Since setting it up he has done nothing to refine, improve or personalize it, and it is a standard laboratory in every respect. It suits his needs for now, and he may well improve it soon if time allows.</div>
<div>Beatriz’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Characteristics: Refinement +2, Size +0 Virtues/Flaws: Highly Organized, Spotless; Greater Feature (Mirror), Living Quarters; Missing Equipment (Binding Familiar, Teaching), Missing Ingredients (Perdo), Undecorated. General Quality +2, Upkeep -3, Safety 0, Warping 0, Health –1, Aesthetics 0, Bonuses: +2 Imaginem, +1 Creo. Penalty: All Perdo totals Halved (and then halved again by Beatriz’s Deficient Technique: Perdo)  Cost: 10 BP</div>
<div>Occupying the space below Joia’s sanctum and laboratory in the tower, Beatriz’s laboratory is the one she was taught in during her apprenticeship before Joia moved upstairs after the death of Humbert. Beatriz has painted over the fine murals, thrown out the desks and apprentice training materials, and discarded all the potted plants, as if trying to expunge all memory of the unhappy years she spent in the room. Unfortunately she has done nothing to improve the laboratory in this process, and in personalizing it has managed to bring something of her own Deficiency with Perdo to the laboratory: the supplies for work in that Technique are woefully inadequate. Annoyed at Serena taking over Joia’s old living quarters in the rooms below, Beatriz lives in her laboratory like</div>
<div>Xenophanes, and has installed a bed, table and chairs, and a few other furnishings. To allow her to work in the confined space that remains she keeps the room carefully organized and spotlessly clean, and has thrown out much of the equipment used in binding a familiar, as she has no current plans in that direction. As a result she is completely unable to bind a familiar or teach in this laboratory at present. All Perdo lab totals are halved (so effectively quartered with her Deficient Technique: Perdo), though some expenditure of silver and a journey to Toulouse or Cahors to acquire supplies and replace the missing ingredients could rectify this in a few days. Beatriz’s laboratory does however contain one impressive item: a magnificent full length mirror, curved to fit the wall, and beautifully framed, that casts a subtly distorted reflection. It is Beatriz’s pride and joy, and grants her +2 to Imaginem Laboratory Totals. The laboratory also grants a +1 to Creo. In addition, the general quality of the laboratory despite Beatriz’s efforts remains high, and it grants her an additional +2 bonus to all Laboratory Totals, cumulative with the other bonuses. However, it is very unhealthy to live surrounded by magical ingredients in such a confined space, and Beatriz suffers a –1 penalty to Recovery rolls.</div>
<div>Alyssa’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Alyssa has a laboratory in a stone building near the main gate, built against the fort’s wall. Since arriving she has set it up and personalized it to the normal standard, but it is in every way a very ordinary laboratory. She travels so much that she is unlikely to find time to improve it in the near future.</div>
<div>The Guest Laboratories</div>
<div>There are two additional laboratories currently not in use. Both are identical to the buildings Xenophanes, Lexora, Alyssa, and Ahenobarbus use. One is stocked as a standard laboratory, the other is very basic and if used as it is would impose a –3 on Laboratory Totals, though this could easily be rectified by a season’s work. These are made available to visiting magi, and new recruits to the covenant would be assigned one of these laboratories. These cost an additional 100 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Village: Belfort du Quercy</div>
<div>Belfort du Quercy is a village of just 96 inhabitants, the majority covenfolk of Jardin, and all of whom regard themselves as loyal subjects of Lady Joia. All know, or have at least heard village gossip, that their mistress is a magician, but they keep the fact hidden from outsiders. It’s a village matter, and everyone, even Father Augustine, likes Joia and Xenophanes, even if the others are a little strange. The villagers are primarily engaged in market gardening, tending the vineyards and looking after the sheep who are grazed in the lowlands, and on the other (north facing) side of the ridge. The villagers get on well with each other, and are used to travelers, even very odd ones, because of their proximity to the Cahors road. There is no inn, but several locals will put up respectable-seeming travelers in their cottages overnight for a few coins. There is only one thing that divides the villages: religion. Three quarters are Cathars, and the remainder faithful to the Church. Nonetheless, there is no conflict, and little theological debate, as the divide runs right through families and households. Even Father Augustine would do all he could to shelter the heretics from persecution if the madness of the crusade returned, and when the Bishop of Cahors conducts a visitation even the Cathars dutifully file in to church to help the good curé out. The village has a Dominion aura of 1, except for the two religious buildings.</div>
<div>Chapel of Saint Desiderius</div>
<div>The covenant does not have its own chapel, but all the magi except Lexora attend mass on Easter Sunday in the village, which has a tiny red brick chapel dedicated to Saint Desiderius, in Merovingian times the bishop of Cahors. It’s still used despite the prevalence of Catharism in the village, and the curé Augustine gathers his tiny flock once a week on Sunday to say mass, and hears confession at Easter, Christmas and on the Feast of Saint Desiderius (November 15th), as well as occasionally throughout the year as needs dictate. The chapel has a Dominion aura of 2, except at the altar where it reaches 4. The graveyard where goats peacefully munch among the long grass has an aura of 1, like most of the village.</div>
<div>The Unaud Barn</div>
<div>The Cathars hold their prayer meetings at the barn of the Unaud family, a stone and wooden barn near the family house. It has</div>
<div>a Dominion aura of 3 from years of use as a prayer room. Raissa Unaud, the ancient matriarch of the family, is a Perfecta, and good friend of Xenophanes, though she disapproves mildly of magic. Other Perfecti come and go, always staying with members of the Unaud clan.</div>

<h3>External Relations</h3>

<div>Jardin has missed the last four Tribunal meetings, having turned insular following the death of Humbert. With only six votes it is a fairly minor force compared with the larger covenants of the Tribunal, but this political inactivity does not mean the magi do not visit, trade with and have opinions on the other covenants, or they on Jardin. If the magi can unite enough to send representatives to the next Tribunal meeting, then these existing relationships may prove crucial in determining the political outcomes of Jardin’s intervention. Aedes Mercurii: Given the size and importance of Aedes Mercurii, it is perhaps surprising how little contact there is between Jardin and that covenant. Only Lexora visits, and her outspoken support of the Cults of Mercury, Mars and Vulcan there has ruffled feathers at Castra Solis but gained Jardin little attention otherwise. Jardin is a small, almost irrelevant place in the eyes of most of the magi at Aedes Mercurii. While Lexora delights in her visits, there is one magus who actively avoids going there, and fears the day he is summoned. Ahenobarbus must answer to Protendus, who dwells here, but has been avoiding contact. Ara Maxima Nova: While Joia enjoys excellent relations with their neighbors at Stella Durus, Lexora has forged a firm friendship with the pagan magi of Ara Maxima Nova. Lexora is not party to many of the secrets of the covenant, but by secretly lowering herself to copying Joia’s tractatus on viticulture, which proved useful to the wine producing magi here, and through shared classical paganism Lexora has been told more of the cult than any other outsider since Guillermo joined. Lexora has caricatured the other magi of Jardin, and done all she can to make Joia in particular sound dangerous and insane. Jardin magi arriving without Lexora may be asked to leave and be treated with disdain. Bellaquin: Bellaquin has long been a natural ally of Jardin. Both being Jerbiton-led covenants, and until recently close neighbors, they have supported each other at many Tribunals</div>
<div>and done all they can to assist each other. However since Humbert’s death, Joia’s obsession with the Garden, and Bellaquin fleeing the Crusade, the relationship between the two, while still cordial, has become more distant. Valgravian and Joia are unsurprisingly friends, but she had far more interest in the covenant prior to its fall and evacuation to Andorra in 1202. Ahenobarbus has a great deal of respect for Artemis by reputation, given their shared interests, but the two Tremere have yet to meet. Castra Solis: Castra Solis has long ignored Jardin as nothing more than an effective extension of Bellaquin; the political isolation in which Jardin has held itself has caused them to be almost irrelevant in terms of Tribunal politics, and Jardin officially has little interest in House Flambeau affairs and the Mercurian/ Mithraist dispute. Lexora and Ahenobarbus, however, strongly favor building links with Castra Solis, and agree with that covenant that Jardin is far too exposed to the mundane world, and should have learned from the fates of Lariander and Bellaquin. Unfortunately Lexora’s links with the Cult of Mercury, and Xenophanes’ pacifism, sit ill with Castra Solis, hampering real cooperation. Forging closer links will require tact and diplomacy, though Joia is personally friends with both Garus and Troya. Coenobium: The Coenobium and Jardin enjoyed peaceful relations, until a recent row broke out when Joia remarked publicly once too often that the legendary beauty of Alazais was “superficial – the woman lacks charm”. Alazais has responded in kind with a number of pointed jibes at Joia, and troubadours now are frequently asked to judge between their charms, and indeed sing of the matter. Relatively few have ever set eyes on Alazais, so Joia is pleased that she is currently winning this contest. Xenophanes remains friends with the Gorgiastic (but non-Cathar) Polus, but again relations have suffered as Polus has become increasingly intolerant of Xenophanes’ occasional stupidities. While the Coenobium and Jardin have no real reason to dislike each other, a clash of personalities means they no longer get on. Lexora has seen no reason to get involved so far, but doubtless will eventually try to manipulate the situation to her own advantage. Ostal de Exiles: Not many people were ever willing to listen to Gilbert, and when he renounced House Jerbiton to join House Flambeau and become a questing knight most Jerbiton turned their backs upon him. Joia was an exception. She finds Gilbert frightening but compelling, and is, while not attracted to him, one of the few magi who respected him in his wilderness years, before events propelled him</div>
<div>to leadership of his covenant. He returns Joia’s respect, and their mutual hatred of the northerners and the crusade has made them allies. Jardin has so far done nothing to actively assist the violent plans of the Ostal, and Lexora, while respecting their passion, believes the coming war will destroy the Order, and so counsels extreme caution. Xenophanes rejects violence on principle, and only Alyssa regularly visits them, but in her last visit, intended to win support for her proposed rescue of the besieged Gorgiastic Cathars of Tolosa Paratge, managed to provoke a very unpleasant disagreement between her hosts. Popilia in particular, motivated by her hatred of Cathars, was outraged, and whether she declares Wizard’s War on Alyssa or simply reports her activities to the White faction remains to be seen. While Beatriz remains typically detached and despondent, Ahenobarbus is simply concerned with getting Garsenda out of the covenant and safely under his wing where she can serve the greater interests of House Tremere and the Order. If he could find a way to use her position within the Ostal de Exiles to reduce the threat of the faidits he would, but so far she has refused to meet with him or answer correspondence. Miniatia Sophia: Like Jardin, this covenant has been politically isolated, only becoming active during the last four Tribunals, a period during which, entirely by chance, Jardin has not attended. However, there is some distrust of Jardin from this Criamon clutch, founded by Leonarda of Aragon forty years ago. In the 1170’s Leonarda visited the Cave of Twisting shadows and met Xenophanes, and learned of the bizarre experiment in teaching a fool wisdom that the House was engaged upon. The fact that her parens was also the parens of Xenophanes, and that Xenophanes was Initiated in to The Path of Walking Backwards like herself did nothing to make the two friends. Leonarda publicly decried the experiment as insanity, and refused to acknowledge Xenophanes at all. When, in 1179, Leonarda founded Miniatia Sophia, The Cave of Twisting Shadows sent Xenophanes to the Tribunal. Leonarda refused to admit Xenophanes to her covenant. Xenophanes, as always, simply shrugged, and went off to make a home for himself at Jardin. Joia is offended on Xenophanes’ behalf, and fully understands why her friend is tempted by the Gorgiastic Cathar path, and the utter hostility with which Miniatia Sophia regards Jardin has done nothing to make things easier. It is not a matter of politics, pragmatism, or even House loyalties on the part of the Criamon clutch, but a deep-seated mystical opposition to everything Xenophanes is involved with, that will</div>
<div>be maintained regardless of expedience with a peculiar deep but dispassionate hatred. Stella Durus: Stella Durus and Jardin enjoy excellent relations, and should Jardin begin attending Tribunal, it is likely that Bellaquin, Stella Durus, and Jardin will vote together on many issues, becoming a significant political force in the Tribunal for the first time. Jean Marie of Stella Durus corresponds extensively with Joia on matters relating to Courtly Love. Tolosa Paratge: The collapse of Tolosa Paratge has robbed Jardin of an important ally. While Mariola of Jerbiton was a good friend to both Humbert and Joia, she is now trapped within the regio and has proved impossible to contact, with St. Tropez and the White faction carefully blockading the regio entrance. Jardin is deeply divided over what to do; Joia is inclined to negotiate a settlement between St. Tropez and Mariola, but has so far remained inactive. Xenophanes is utterly disgusted by violence, and the killings have disillusioned him somewhat with the Gorgiastic Cathars. Nonetheless, he too wishes to do all he can to rescue the Black faction from the siege, so long as no violence is employed. To Ahenobarbus this is simply proof of the madness engulfing the Tribunal; he thinks Jardin should support the White Faction, however, and expel all heretics before it suffers the same fate. Beatriz claims to have had a terrible vision of the future of Tolosa Paratge, but refuses to say what it was. One member of Jardin has, however, already become actively involved. Alyssa has decided that the Gorgiastic Cathars must be saved, and has, unbeknownst to the others, been silently scrying upon the White Faction, preparing to try to force entry to the regio.</div>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<div>Jardin has a number of important resources, both mundane and magical.</div>

<h3>Income Sources: The Vineyards</h3>

<div>The region around Cahors is famous for its black wines, which are actually very deep red in color, while the grapes themselves are a deep purplish-black. The grapes are known as Côt Noir, a variety of Malbec grape. They need a great deal of sun, and so are normally grown on south facing slopes. Almost every</div>
<div>available hillside in the region is terraced with vines, with dozens of vineyards producing the excellent wine. Cahors wine is exported widely, and is considered a luxury item, being famous even in England for its quality.</div>

<h3>Enchanted Devices</h3>

<div>The following enchanted device is the only one held by the covenant.</div>

<h3>Library</h3>

<div>The impressive library building is built of beautiful glazed red brick in the style of the region, and is similar in form to a basilica, with a great domed roof covered in verdigrised copper. Despite the resemblance to a church, it is clearly a secular building. Surprisingly, the building possesses no windows at all, and where one might expect to find them are alcoves that hold gaudily pained wooden statues of classical figures associated with the arts and learning. Over the door, in pride of place, is the Roman poet Virgil, and flanking him Ovid and Homer. Steps lead up to a large double wooden door, which opens outward and is often left wide open during the day, the librarian believing the flow of air is good for the books. On entering the library up a short flight of steps one finds oneself in a large antechamber, which acts as both the librarian’s office and the repository for mundane texts. The walls to left and right have large oak tables, and on these the mundane texts are securely chained, while the wall opposite has a large open archway through to the next room, where the summae on Arts reside. The librarian Bohella sits just within the doorway, at a small desk, keeping a wary eye on all visitors. She takes an especial pride in the books in this room, and manages some two seasons’ worth of study a year from them, as her duties are comparatively light and she is maintained as Wealthy by the covenant. In the event of any disaster befalling the library, these books would be the first books she attempted to save. She knows all but one mysterious work (not written in Latin) well and can advise on their contents, scope, and quality. The second room on the ground floor contains perhaps the most valuable books in the library, not that Bohella values them as such. Nevertheless, the large arch allows her a fine view of what goes on in this room, and she swiftly intervenes if she feels these texts are in anyway at risk. Each of the eleven books is chained to a small oak desk, with a high wooden surround</div>
<div>that partitions it off from the rest of the room, providing privacy. The small sloping desks have enough room for the book, an ink well and quills, and parchment on which to make notes. Each of the accompanying chairs has an exquisitely carved back representing the Art of the book available at that desk. The second floor of the library is given over to the fine collection of tractatus the covenant has managed to amass over the years. This is by far the least frequented part of the building, as the magae have already studied almost all the tractatus in which they have any interest. It is a large, echoing space, with large tables scattered through the room, each with one or two books chained to it, providing ample scope for hiding or quietly dozing in a secluded spot when one is meant to be studying. An archway with a lockable door leads through to the Council Chamber, above the entrance hall. Stairs lead to the Arts summae below and up to the top floor and the collection of Laboratory Texts. Guests are welcome to spend a season or more copying books, providing they present a summa of equal or greater value to the collection in exchange. Such guests are waived the usual guest expenses, so valuable is the acquisition of summae considered to the covenant, even if the summa presented in exchange is on Arts already represented. All too often the Covenant Coun</div>
<div>cil has to rule on which maga is granted access to a particular book for a particular season at the moment when two magae’s study interests coincide, for only one maga can be reading any given book at a time!</div>

<h3>The Mysterious Book</h3>

<div>There are two books in this room that are not written in Latin. One is Joia’s simple primer for Occitan readers learning Latin, but the other is more mysterious. In fact, it is hard for most magi to even make out what language it is in, though the alphabet is Visgothic uncials, which are used in many of the Latin books and while old fashioned are a perfectly readable form of the normal Latin alphabet. While the script is therefore clear to any magus, the words the letters spell out are completely unknown. In fact, the book is written in the Gothic language, and the content is based upon an analysis of the Visigothic stones around the pool that Androcles translated and which first brought him to the covenant site. Along with his adaptation of the information into Initiation Scripts that are contained in the book, the book contains many secrets of House Bjornaer, covering the period up to 1150, that serve as a primer for developing Organization Lore: House Bjornaer. Bohella has no idea of the content, or even of the language in which it is written, but knows the book is forbidden except to Joia, Lexora, and those they directly authorize to look at it. However, the book is kept chained to a table like the other books in this room, and no attempt is made to hide it. The obscurity of Gothic as a tongue serves to remove any risk of outsiders learning the content, and without at least one experience point in Organization Lore: House Bjornaer to understand the basic concepts the contents appear to be gibberish anyway. Lexora encourages fellow Bjornaer, even those from other covenants, to study the book, if they possess the requisite knowledge of Gothic. Very few, even in House Bjornaer, do, however. Should a reader be granted access, the book is as follows. Androcles of Bjornaer, The Mystery of the Stones; Organization Lore: House Bjornaer summa, Quality: 15; Level: 4; Written in Gothic (27 BP)</div>

<h3>Shield of Dismissal</h3>

<div>Just within the gateway a grog waits and watches approaching visitors. Those of obvious rank or wealth are always admitted, but known troublemakers or those who appear to be of no importance, French, or clearly allied with the crusade are turned away with a magic item created by Ahenobarbus to try to reduce the flow of unwanted visitors. A shield with the embossed shape of a set of panpipes, covered in gold leaf.</div>

<div>Laboratory Texts</div>
<div>The upper floor of the library, beneath the impressive domed roof, holds a fine selection of Laboratory Texts. Some have been written by the resident magi, others have been traded for over the years, and there is also a large selection that were gained from the mysterious shipwreck by Androcles before the founding of the covenant. The covenant encourages seasonal service that adds more spells to these texts. Magi from other covenants sometimes come to study the Laboratory Texts and are welcomed to spend up to one season a year as guests copying in the library building, but are expected to both make the usual contribution as guests and to also gift the collection as many spell levels of Laboratory Texts as they copy. Any duplicates are then traded with other covenants to improve the scope of the collection.</div>
<div>Each of the laboratory texts has been fully translated, and they are divided by Form, with each collection contained in a locked chest in a part of the room decorated with a wall mosaic in small ceramic tiles showing the symbol of the Form in question. Texts are in the form of scrolls, small books, and loosely bound sheaves of parchment, but all are invaluable in recreating the spell design.</div>

<div>Story Seed: Heresy in the Library?</div>
<div>Xenophanes has contributed just three books to the library, but if the Church authorities or a hostile magi were to examine them problems could arise. One, The Simple Christians, is a very basic primer on Cathar Theology. It is not an endorsement, but it is sympathetic, and it also discusses the beliefs of the Gorgiastic Cathar tradition within Ex Miscellanea, and so could be used as evidence that the Order is sheltering heretics within its ranks. The second book is just as explosive: a simple tractatus on Vim, it equates The Gift with shards of the Divine broken by the Fall and yearning for return to Heaven, and escape from the cycles of time. Church scholars, unless Gifted and possessing Magic Theory, would have difficulty making sense of it, but they would certainly believe it heretical and call upon Xenophanes to recant his errors, and this would bring the entire covenant under severe scrutiny. His third text is, fortunately, uncontroversial. So low is the regard that Xenophanes’ intelligence is held that no one at the covenant has yet read them and noticed the potential problem, but when a scholarly papal legate visits, the situation quickly gets out of hand, and the magi must find some way to stop him examining these books further. Even worse, visitors from other covenants copied the books, and they are starting to circulate through the Order. Can the copies be recovered and destroyed in time?</div>

<h3>Vis Sources</h3>

<div>The covenant has access to a number of vis sources, most very close to the covenant itself. Until 1202 the vis to the north was largely owned by the magi of Bellaquin, and they still lay claim to many of the readily available vis sources in that area and collect them, a situation Jardin respects.</div>
<div>The Black Grapes</div>
<div>6 pawns of Perdo per year in autumn The vineyard produces the famous black grapes, Côt Noir. There are tens of thousands of grapes on the vines in the late autumn as the harvest begins, and by tradition the harvest at Jardin must be completed by All Saint’s Day, November 1st. The evening before, as the grapes are collected, one bunch of grapes becomes invested with six pawns of Perdo vis at sunset. They must</div>
<div>be the last bunch harvested, or the vis is simply lost. The villagers have a long established tradition of granting their lords the last bunch, and by tradition the chatelaine (Joia) has the right to dictate what bunch that is. Occasionally however the process goes wrong. The bunch must be harvested with a copper sickle, caught in a copper bowl, and untouched by human hands until it leaves the vineyard to retain the vis.</div>
<div>The Reflection of Beatriz’s Lover</div>
<div>2 pawns of Imaginem per year in spring A recent discovery by Beatriz, this vis source is unusual in that it normally manifests in her laboratory, though in fact any lovers in the covenant could produce the vis, with any mirror. Unfortunately only Serena, Joia and Beatriz possess hand mirrors, and only Beatriz a full length mirror. Two people must exchange a passionate kiss in front of the mirror, and the image of the embrace then burns itself on to the mirror until dawn or dusk. The vis must be be transferred to another item to be useful and retained. The kiss must be genuine, based upon love or lust, and Beatriz therefore has attempted to take lovers she genuinely desires, but with her morose temperament it can be difficult to find men who reciprocate, and her seduction attempts are often mocked by Joia.</div>
<div>The Heart of a Lover</div>
<div>1 pawn of Corpus per year in summer Jardin has developed a strong reputation among troubadours for extolling the virtues of the cult of courtly love. This vis source reflects that tradition, and has only been discovered in recent years. On a summer’s evening within the bower, a lover must present his lady with a rose. As he does, the rose pricks his hand, and a single drop of blood forms on his thumb. The lady must collect the blood, usually on her handkerchief, and it forms a pawn of Corpus vis.</div>
<div>The Fiery Liquor</div>
<div>3 pawns of Ignem per year in spring Over at the village of Vazerac to the west they produce black wine too, but their best vintage has an unusual quality. Three barrels of the hundreds filled for trade each summer contain a particularly deep red wine, that if closely examined seems to have real flames burning within its ruby depths. It would be almost impossible for the magi or grogs to find the correct barrels, but luckily the villagers there are aware of the phenomenon. Unfortunately for the magi, the</div>
<div>village has no lord, but has, like several of the villages in the vicinity of Toulouse, appointed consuls, and the twelve men and women, all persons born in the village, demand a fair price for the magic wine. They know a little of the Order of Hermes, and threaten that if the wine is not purchased by Jardin it will be sold to other magicians. Each year the village consuls determine their asking price for the pawns of Ignem vis and barrels of fine wine; usually not money (though sometimes a pound of silver has been accepted) but instead some magical favor: a healing, an improved harvest, or a magical farm implement. Sometimes their demands are far more expensive in terms of vis than the vis gained from the wine, but failure to comply could result in the vis source being offered to another covenant. The villagers have no idea of the value of vis, and assume magicians can do anything, and so are not inclined to be reasonable or bargain once they have set their price for the year.</div>
<div>The Highest Leaf</div>
<div>1 pawn of Muto per year in autumn In a small faerie wood high on a hill top some sixteen miles east of Jardin stands a tall tree of a type quite unique in the region. The tree towers above the surrounding wood, and in autumn the highest leaf changes color to a rich gold that seems to sparkle in all the colors of the rainbow in the sun. Entering the wood with its Faerie aura of 3 leads to harassment by the minor goblin fae who dwell within, so magic is usually employed to reach the tree top and collect the leaf.</div>
<div>Change of Heart</div>
<div>1 pawn of Muto, 3 pawns of Mentem per year One of the harder of the vis sources to collect for the covenant, this relies upon something happening spontaneously. When someone enters the Garden of Love to quest for her Heart’s Desire, and enters the regio, she often does not return. Some, however, return changed; discovering their Heart’s Desire alters them forever. Usually this is reflected in a drastic personality trait change. When they change in this manner, questers are often overwhelmed</div>
<div>by a desire to set things right, and to express their new found values in the wider world. The first strong manifestation in an outward behavior to others of that change leads to an item becoming imbued with 1 pawn of Muto and 3 pawns of Mentem vis. The problem is that the change may be expressed in the covenant, in the village, or not until they return home, and someone has to be present to witness it, and collect the vis before it melts away at sunset. Once collected the vis remains – it is finding it that is difficult. It is always the first person to experience a complete change of heart in any given year who manifests the vis, but when that happens varies greatly from year to year.</div>
<div>The Fur of the Saturated Beast</div>
<div>3 pawns of Aquam per year in summer The Lion’s pool becomes charged with vis once a year on St. John’s Day (June 24th). If a sanguine beast (most predators, not necessarily a lion) swims in the pool on that day, when it leaves the water and shakes its fur the droplets that fly off, if collected somehow, are charged</div>

<div>Blood on the Talons</div>
<div>3 pawns of Animal per year in summer One day in early summer a white dove appears, flying over the covenant. At once the grogs call the magi, who gather falcons and rush out. Once the bird perches on the tower roof, the falcons may be unleashed, and the dove flies off at speed, using all kinds of evasive maneuvers to avoid being caught. If a falcon brings it down, then the talons of the raptor that made the kill are coated with blood that contains three pawns of Animal vis.</div>
<div>The Blooming of Love</div>
<div>4 pawns of Herbam per Year in Spring Entering the Night Garden is always hazardous, but once a year it is absolutely necessary if this vis is to be collected. Deep within the regio gardens there are four very beautiful plants. The first source is a tall tree that produces great yellow blossoms that sway in the wind, the second a green herb that, while small and delicate, is of incredible beauty, though those picking it must make a Stamina + Concentration stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or fall asleep as it gives off a vapor that dulls the senses and tires the body. The third source grows on what appears to be a grave, in a garden where the nightingales sing, and consists of tiny black berries on a dark purple creeper that grows over the ruined stone walls of the enclosure. Finally, the fourth source is a red spiky shrub with razor sharp leaves that easily draw blood, and which can only be collected after a traditional folk dance is performed by at least two pair of lovers around it. Every year the grogs escort newly adult covenfolk, four men and four women, in to the Garden to try to find and collect the vis before dawn breaks. Unfortunately the exact position of each location seems to vary year by year, as does the level of resistance raised by the inhabitants of the Garden.</div>

<h3>Vis Stocks</h3>

<div>The covenant has vis stocks stored in locked chests in the council chamber.</div>
<div>The Rainbow Leaves</div>
<div>7 pawns of Muto vis These golden leaves which sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow are collected from the Highest Tree (see earlier).</div>
<div>The Indigo Pawns of Toulouse</div>
<div>7 pawns of Rego vis This vis appears as indigo colored wooden chess pawns, made into that shape for the purpose of vis trade. They were acquired some years back from Tolosa Paratge, and have so far found no use.</div>
<div>The Beast’s Bath Water</div>
<div>5 pawns of Aquam vis Linen cloths the size of large handkerchiefs that never dry out, these contain the Aquam vis gathered as described in The Fur of the Beast earlier.</div>
<div>The Sanguine Roses</div>
<div>9 pawns of Animal vis The tiny flecks of blood collected in Blood on the Talons (see earlier) are transferred by Xenophanes for ease of use to coin sized wooden rose shaped counters he carves himself, and that have a blood red hue.</div>

<h3>Covenant Finances</h3>

<div>The covenant has 300 pounds of silver at its disposal, stored in a locked chest within the manor house. The covenant in 1220 makes a profit of 250 pounds from the vineyards, and spends 218 pounds each year, leaving a surplus each year of 32 pounds added to the stores. One major expense is tithing ten percent of income to both the Church and the Cathars. The expenditure in Mythic Pounds breaks down as follows:</div>
<div>Expenditure  Base  Cost  Reduction  Total Buildings  22  22  0   22 Consumables  28  28  0   28 Laboratories  8  8  0   8 Tithes   50  50  0   50 Provisions  70  70  0   70 Wages   28  28  0   28 Weapons and Armor 1  1  0   1 Writing Materials 8  8  0   8 Sundries  1  1  0   1 Total          216</div>

<div>wind that blows across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa, brought with it a great fall of pinkish sand. This sand was discovered by the magi of the Coenobium and Stella Durus to contain Auram vis, and large amounts were traded throughout the Tribunal. This vis originates from that source, and is kept in tiny glass vials for ease of use.</div>
<div>The Fiery Liquor of Vazerac</div>
<div>2 pawns of Ignem vis Tiny glass bottles stopped with wax contain a single shot of very strong alcohol, as if distilled from the wine. The liquid looks like liquid fire, burning orange and red within the bottles.</div>
<div>The Wondrous Poems</div>
<div>8 pawns of Imaginem vis These small stopped clay flasks each contain a poem recited with passion by a troubadour. The vis is used when the bottle is opened and the poem whispers itself to</div>
<div>the wind. They were traded for with Tolosa Paratge in happier times.</div>
<div>The Frozen Kisses</div>
<div>2 pawns of Imaginem vis The image of Beatrix embracing a lover has been taken from her mirror, and magically been transferred on to two pieces of fine yellow silk.</div>

<div>The Changing Hearts</div>
<div>4 pawns of Mentem vis Little hearts the size of coins, seemingly made of carefully stitched rose petals, delicate and exquisite, that beat in the hand like real</div>
<div>hearts. They change color with the mood of the holder, and sometimes size too. They are from The Change of Heart vis source (see earlier).</div>
<div>The Perfumed Spirals</div>
<div>25 pawns of Vim vis Small spirals of what appears to be purple metal, which give off a strong odor of violets and strangely enough taste delicious if licked. These have been distilled from the covenant aura, and are kept in a leather bag within the vis chest, as vermin and even, on one occasion, grogs have been known to try and consume them.</div>

<h3>Suggested Storylines for Jardin</h3>

<div>There are several main storylines to address with a Jardin saga, and they cover threats from within the covenant in addition to threats from the outside.</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Facechanger</div>
<div>The garden is home to a large number of weird and dangerous faeries. Many are simply faerie animals, or personifications of the secret powers of plants that grow within. A few, however, are truly weird expressions of some aspect of love, romance or associated themes, but perhaps the strangest of all is the faerie commonly known as Skullface, though as a faerie spirit its true form is unknown. Skullface is a relatively powerful spirit that escaped the garden through the Aegis on the night Beatriz failed her quest, and now haunts the County of Tolouse. It is linked to the form of Imaginem, and it always begins meddling in human affairs in the same way, by changing the appearance of a loved one of the victim’s face to appear as a hideous skull. From that point onwards Skullface sets about driving the two apart, using her Guide power until the relationship ends, and is replaced by new relationships. This unpleasant faerie is believed by some Merinita to be the reason that fortunetellers often claim that symbols of death are actually symbols of change or moving on in your life. Recently Skullface has returned to Jardin, where she is choosing which relationship she should end as traumatically as possible. After she has destroyed the relationship, she always sets about attempting to</div>
<div>help build anew relationship of equal strength to replace it, of course. A visiting noble, grog or companion may be her next victim, with disastrous results. (Based on Regio)</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Mercenaries</div>
<div>Both sides in the war hire companies of mercenaries (routiers), denounced by the Church and denied the Holy Sacraments. They may comprise villainous scum, or warriors of great personal honor, but either way they are never welcome once peace arrives, or even during war when they take what they can, thieving and scavenging their way across the countryside and leaving a trail of destruction behind them. When a group of mercenary captains made unemployed by the current lull in fighting realize they must flee Toulouse or risk being hanged by their former employer, the count, some of them remember a rich vineyard and small castle they saw on the Cahors road. They arrive in Belfort, billet themselves in the villagers’ houses, and steal the wine stores. Fortunately the commanders are able to stop them drinking the wine, knowing it has great value and that their rough soldiers will indulge in an orgy of rape and burning if they become too drunk, probably destroying the village. They await a response from the fortress, and if the magi are not swift to deal with the problem, assault it and take it as their new headquarters, knowing it seems to owe fealty to no lord. (Based on War Zone)</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Walls of Jardin</div>
<div>Ahenobarbus is keen to repair the crumbling walls of Jardin, and make the place defensible again. If he does this, a new problem appears as Alix de Montfort hears word of a small independent castle apparently strengthening its defenses. Dressing as a widow (for such she is since the death of her husband, crusader leader Simon) she takes some maidservants and local bodyguards and travels to the fortress to see if it might pose a threat to the crusade and de Montfort possessions, and require taking. If she perceives the covenant as loyal to the count of Toulouse, or heretical, her armies will soon follow. (Based on Crumbling).</div>
<div>Story Seed: Unwelcome Guests</div>
<div>The whole of the county of Toulouse has become a patchwork of territories controlled by the de Montforts and crusaders, and territory still loyal to Raimond VI of Toulouse or other southern lords. There is a weakness in the magical defense provided by the Shield of Dismissal, in that it requires the grog on guard duty to decide at the gate if the guests arriving our Occitan loyalist nobles Joia will welcome, or French or crusader nobles who are her mortal enemies. From time to time mistakes are made, and Jardin pays host to a party of its mortal enemies. Can Joia’s loathing for these people be controlled and the guests encouraged to quickly leave before they learn too much? (Based on Road)</div>
</div sidebars>


<h3>The Covenant in Play</h3>

<div>Jardin is designed as a Summer covenant that mirrors the strife of the Tribunal in which it is nominally set, but which also provides an exemplar of a covenant with a very specific theme and mysteries the magae resident within do not fully understand.</div>
<div>Covenant Themes</div>
<div>The major theme of the Covenant is the quest for the Heart’s Desire, both on a very literal level, in the Night Garden, and on a metaphorical level. This theme is about romantic love, and the envy and jealousy that sometimes accompanies it, and most stories should contain lovers and misunderstandings, including both those whose love is expressed in chaste longing and worship of the lady as an almost divine ideal, and those who love is sensual and often adulterous. Fill your stories with lovers, hearts full and hearts broken, and the conflicts and jealousy love brings, and you will be expressing the main theme of Jardin. Other themes, however, are also important to stories set at this covenant.</div>
<div>The Struggle for Dominance</div>
<div>The fractured council has led to a clear power struggle between Lexora and Joia, which reflects two very different ambitions and plans for the future of Jardin. Lexora will eventually make a move to openly denounce Joia’s plans and the threat that the faeries of the Garden have become, and make a political play for power. Serena may well finally decide to seek support from crusaders or the southern nobility to be restored to authority in her home, and seek to expel the magi, though her secret love for Ahenobarbus is currently preventing this catastrophe. The covenant could quickly fall in to Winter as the magi move to more and more open conflict, perhaps even following the awful example of Tolosa Paratge into civil war.</div>
<div>The Crusade</div>
<div>Linked to the conflict of faith is the threat of the crusader armies, and even the undisciplined troops of the count of Toulouse. Jardin is a flawed but defensible castle, and both sides may wish to besiege it, or if no resistance is offered impose a garrison. Joia’s close relationship with southern lords prevents much threat from them unless she</div>
<div>is replaced as leader, but if the attention of the crusade is drawn to the covenant the end could be sudden and violent. How the magi deal with this threat is a constant issue dominating the lives of the resident magi, and often problems appear in the form of a visit from some powerful southern lord, such as Count Raimond of Toulouse who often comes to Joia to seek advice in how to pursue the struggle against the French.</div>
<div>The Question of Faith</div>
<div>Jardin is home to both Cathars and loyal members of the church, currently coexisting in harmony. If the good curé Father Augustine is replaced by a more belligerent cleric, the Bishop of Cahors comes on visitation and realizes the village is full of Cathars, or the Cathar leaders, the Unaud family, lose authority to the preaching of visiting Perfecti, the easy going tolerance could be replaced by bitter conflict. If your saga follows history the crusade will die down within a decade, to be followed by two decades of the Inquisition hunting heretics, and many stories will ensue.</div>
<div>The Threat From Within</div>
<div>The faeries clearly represent a new and growing threat to Jardin, as the more powerful fae try to manipulate the magi to play out their stories, and their less powerful brethren creep out of the garden at night if the Aegis is weak, and become more and more aggressive within the Night Garden in playing out their distinct roles. Joia did not intentionally create the Faerie aura, but her romantic games and the tales of the troubadours have presented her with a serious problem that will continue to grow as the years pass.</div>
<div>Broken-Hearted Questers</div>
<div>Joia is careful about who she allows to attempt the quest in the Garden of Love, but some who come to seek their Heart’s Desire are shattered by the experience and their minds broken. Trying to restore them to some semblance of sanity, or to help cover up their sudden disappearance, especially given that many of them are politically powerful nobles from the southern resistance, will be a recurring issue the magi must face.</div>

<h3>Player Character Roles at Jardin</h3>

<div>Jardin is quite suitable for use as a covenant for player character magi. Any of the magi</div>
<div>can be replaced, with Alyssa, Beatriz, Ahenobarbus, and Xenophanes being the first to be replaced, in that order. It is also possible that the characters may have served their apprenticeships here, and Xenophanes, Ahenobarbus, and Lexora have all recently trained apprentices, so newly gauntleted magi of Criamon, Tremere, and Bjornaer would make excellent character choices. The order of beginning training would be Lexora’s apprentice, then Xenophanes (by a season), then Ahenobarbus’, who arrived with his master after beginning the apprenticeship in the Transylvanian Tribunal. Such characters should take new positions in covenant precedence: Lexora and Xenophanes’ apprentices ahead in precedence even of Ahenobarbus, who arrived here in 1209, and his apprentice ahead of Alyssa. It is even possible that Joia trained a second apprentice after her</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Moving Jardin to other Tribunals</h3>

<div>Jardin is very clearly situated in the Provence Tribunal during the Albigensian Crusade, but it can, with a little work, be moved to to other Tribunals and times. Romantic love is a common human condition, and while the formal forms of Courtly Love are still mainly sung of by the troubadours of Provence and the trouverts of Normandy, Eleanor of Aquitaine introduced the motifs to the Stonehenge Tribunal, and they are now increasing in fashion in the Greater Alps, Rhine, Iberia and Roman Tribunals too. Moving the covenant to Normandy requires the fewest changes, as Catharism has a hold in some communities there, and Joia’s allegiance can be switched to the French king in the great struggle with the south. The Stonehenge Tribunal has an intriguing possibility in the story of Rosamund Clifford, a mistress of Henry II and romantic rival to his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. Their love affair became public knowledge in 1174, and folklore says that Henry had Rosamund secreted in a magical garden to keep her from the jealous rage of Eleanor. This garden of love was hidden within a maze, but one day Eleanor learned its secrets and confronted Rosamund, offering her a choice of death by poison from a jeweled goblet or a dagger with which to strike out her heart. Poor Rosamund, a legendary beauty, chose to die by poison and was buried at Godstow Priory. An English version of Joia may well have adapted the magical garden near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, and the grapes of Jardin can be replaced with verdant fields of more mundane crops, but the fabulous garden and sad remnants of Rosamund’s last two years can be found in the ruined royal hunting lodge and mysterious garden that was her home during her period in hiding.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>disappointment with Beatriz, though this is not taken account of in her statistics as given. Remove 150 points from her Abilities, Arts and Spell Levels if this option is chosen. It is also possible for new magi who were not trained at the covenant to join, though they may resent the covenant precedence system: this option makes for an interesting setting for players new to Ars Magica to explore political and intrigue based sagas. The cost of the weapons and armor includes all in use by the current grogs and their captain and the spares outlined above. The costs include entertaining up to two nobles and retinue throughout the year. In reality the numbers of visitors varies, and at times there are no guests staying, at other times half a dozen. However, it averages out to two additional nobles, as well as Serena. More on covenant wealth can be found in Covenants, Chapter 5.</div>
<div>Loyalty</div>
<div>The covenfolk are extremely loyal. Using the rules on page 36 of Covenants, we get a base loyalty of –10 based on the Gifts of the member magi. However, this is replaced by 30 owing to the Loyal Covenfolk virtue (Covenants, page 18). Rosamonde as the Turb Captain and provides a +7 bonus, and Serena as Autocrat +6. The superior living conditions (+1) Jardin’s wealth allows the covenfolk provides a bonus as well</div>
<div>Base Loyalty 30 Turb Captain	 +7 Autocrat +6 Living Conditions +10 Total	+4 (53)</div>
<div>The grogs and covenfolk receive a +4 bonus to Personality Traits (including Loyal) when their loyalty is an issue. This will not apply if the question of loyalty is a dispute between the magi, and public arguments or Serena continuing to make threats of harsh punishments against the loyal grogs could quickly reduce the prevailing loyalty modifier. In order to reverse this trend, the covenant can employ a steward and a chamberlain, both of whom help to improve the prevailing loyalty. Loyalty is discussed in Covenants, pages 30–39.</div>

<h3>Jardin as a Background Covenant</h3>

<div>Magi know that Jardin has a strange secret, and the Redcaps talk openly of the belief that those who sleep there too long are cursed with knowledge of their Heart’s Desire, always depicted as something terrible and frightening. This may well intrigue those who hear of it, and they may set off to seek to understand the mystery, find their Heart’s Desire or break the curse. While Joia eventually explains the truth to those she comes to trust, getting her to allow one to perform the quest requires considerable tact or cunning. Indeed any attempt by the player characters to negotiate access to resources such as the library or even find a night’s shelter are likely to draw the visitors into the tangled politics of the council. It is important not to overlook the theme of Jardin, romantic love. Even Hermetic magi can fall in love, and the characters of Jardin can easily become objects of roman</div>
<div>tic interest in your saga, drawing magi from your covenant to become involved in the mysteries and politics of the place. Stories could explore Jardin from other viewpoints than those of Hermetic magi. If, for some reason such as a convention, the storyguide wishes to use Jardin for a simple oneoff story, a knight seeking his Heart’s Desire, a troubadour longing to learn the mystery of the garden of love, a group of inquisitors seeking to uncover heresy, or a party of crusaders attempting to take this rebel fortress by siege or cunning could make for exciting stories that draw upon the covenant as presented. Of course, as an old covenant, Jardin, while isolationist in recent decades, has a longstanding set of relationships with the other Provençal covenants, and given the conflicts within that Tribunal seeking out the votes of Jardin would be a sensible move for any politically astute covenant within the Tribunal. This would involve careful diplomacy to get as many of the bitterly divided Jardin magi to back your motion as possible. Finally, the fall of Jardin, which epitomizes many of the values of Provençal civilization, could be used as a landmark event in your saga, as the crusade finally suppresses the culture of the region, and the repercussions of its downfall could drive stories for your covenant.</div>

<h1>Chapter Four The Oracles of Didyma</h1>


<div sidebars>
<div>Didyma is a cluster of crumbling temples, ten miles south of the city of Miletos and a mile east of the Anatolian coast in the Thebes Tribunal, in the southwest of the Empire of Nicaea. Didyma has intermittently housed an oracle cult for over two thousand years, and the bustling port of Miletos was once a strong intellectual and political rival to Athens in the ancient world. The Hermetic covenant was founded in 990 when remnants of the oracle cult converted to the Order of Hermes, joining House Ex Miscellanea as the Branchidae tradition. Today, magi from other Houses also live at Didyma.</div>

<h3>History</h3>

<div>The history of Didyma is inextricably entwined with the history of the Branchidae.</div>
<div>The Branchidae of House Ex Miscellanea</div>
<div>The Branchidae are a pagan Ex Miscellanea tradition. It is a literal lineage composed of Gifted blood descendants of the tradition’s founder Branchos, who died around 900 BC. Since Branchos, the Branchidae have maintained temples and interpreted the oracle at Didyma. As political control of the region has changed over the centuries the nature of the oracle cult has also changed: at times it has been controlled by officials in Miletos, or even abandoned altogether. In the late 300s AD imperial edicts of the Christian Roman Empire closed the temple, outlawed the cult, and built a large church, a monastery, and a fortress at the site. However, in the 8th century earthquakes irreparably damaged the church and fortress. These were abandoned, which ended four</div>
<div>centuries of Christian occupation. Secretly, local still-pagan, Gifted descendants of the Branchidae (who had preserved the cult secrets) re-occupied the site. These hedge wizards were discovered in 990, just before the Schism War, by the magus Cletus of the Lineage of Pralix. Cletus converted the Branchidae to the Order of Hermes, and gathered numerous prophecies that helped Greek magi to avoid the worst of the Schism conflict. The matriarch Soteria (the grand-parens, and great-great-grand-mother, of the current Branchidae patriarch Alexander) was the first Branchidae convert to the Order of Hermes.</div>
<div>The Founder Branchos</div>
<div>Little is known of Branchos. He constructed the first shrine to Apollo at Didyma and his daughter was the first oracle. Reportedly Branchos lived for several centuries, and perhaps he did not die, instead joining Apollo’s retinue at Olympos.</div>
<div>UnGifted Branchidae</div>
<div>Many of the covenfolk at Didyma are unGifted Branchidae. These covenfolk have no special rights or privileges, but their children are carefully observed for The Gift.</div>
<div>Branchidae at other Covenants</div>
<div>Several external lineages have been founded by Branchidae magi. These are: The line of Tessa: departed Didyma in 1105. The line of Damen: departed Didyma in 1116. The line of Bastards: unknown. In 1220 there is one magus (location unknown) in the line of Tessa and two known magi</div>
<div>Tribunal: Thebes Year Founded: 990 Season: Autumn Symbol: Eye of the Branchidae Branchidae Tradition Virtues</div>
<div>Gifted members of the Branchidae have the following Virtues and Flaws, in addition to usual allocation of Virtues and Flaws. Developing these Virtues and Flaws is a part of Opening the Arts for Branchidae. Major Supernatural Virtue: Death Prophecy (ArM5, page 41) Minor Hermetic Virtue: Branchidae Prophecy Major Hermetic Flaw: Weak Spontaneous Magic (ArM5, page 61)</div>
<div>Minor Hermetic Virtue: Branchidae Prophecy</div>
<div>This Hermetic Virtue allows the character to interpret an oracle’s visions. A Branchidae apprentice acquires this Virtue when his Arts are opened, and the Branchidae know of no other way to transmit the Virtue. However, Apollo Didyma may be able to grant the Virtue to other characters. For details, see later.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>in the line of Damen. In a great crisis the magi of the line of Tessa and Damen may assist Didyma, which is effectively their domus magna. There is an unknown number of magi in the line of Bastards, who are the Gifted children of unGifted Branchidae who have lost contact with the ancestral family at Didyma. Such magi could be in any Hermetic House, unaware of their Branchidae birth-right.</div>

<h3>Recent History</h3>

<div>Since 1132 the covenant has been under the leadership of Alexander. He inherited the title of Patriarch when, after an absence of five consecutive solstices, his parens Jason was deemed lost to Final Twilight. The title of Patriarch is held by the oldest resident Branchidae at Didyma, and Alexander is the fourth Patriarch (following Soteria, Basil, and Jason). Alexander was a young magus (in his early 40s) when Jason died and there were elder non-resident Branchidae magi, Damen and Tessa, who could have returned to rule over Apollo’s sacred spring. Although the details are now obscure, Alexander somehow prevented Damen and Tessa from returning to Didyma. Both elder Branchidae have since reputedly entered Final Twilight (several decades ago), and so Alexander’s reign as Patriarch is now without apparent challenge. His filia Nikola (herself now an old woman) should be the next Matriarch (if she outlives Alexander), although there may be potential challengers among the filii of Damen and Tessa. Under Alexander, the covenant has become a steadily more blatant presence in the city of Miletos. The covenant openly holds property within the city and collects fees for conducting prophecies for the Christian citizens of Miletos. Despite the obvious pagan origins of the prophecy rituals, this “traditional” eccentricity is tolerated, as the ecclesiastic ruler of Miletos, the metropolitan Niketas II, is himself an ally of Alexander and thus prevents the church from raising concerns about Didyma. Indeed, Niketas even owes his election (in 1172) as metropolitan to Alexander’s secret magical interference. In addition, the secular administrators are much too occupied with the decline of the Byzantine (now Nicean) Empire, of which Miletos forms a province, to be overly concerned about the covenant, as long as the magi continue to pay taxes. The last Wizard War fought at the covenant was in 1110, when Hector (House Merinita) was killed by his filius Achillios. The dispute nominally involved a laboratory con</div>

<h3>Prophecies and the Oracle</h3>

<div>The Branchidae petition Apollo Didyma (the aspect of Apollo resident at Didyma) for prophecies. These are received via oracle visions, which are then interpreted by the Branchidae. The oracle is usually a separate person to the Branchidae performing the interpretation.</div>
<div>The Oracle’s Vision</div>
<div>Petitioning Apollo Didyma requires the Branchidae to first decide the subject of the prophecy. The subject can be an individual, a place, a bloodline (ArM5, page 93), or a nation. The Branchidae then prepares a draught of water from the Sacred Spring (which is at the covenant), into which he must transfer a pawn of vis (of any Art). Preparing the potion takes only the length of time required to transfer the pawn of vis: one day if performed in a laboratory (ArM5, page 94), perhaps quicker if the transfer is effected with ReVi spells. The prepared potion is consumed by the oracle, causing her to enter a trance, which lasts about an hour. Afterwards she recites the vision.</div>
<div>• The oracle must have the Visions Supernatural Flaw, but she need not be Gifted. • If the prophecy subject is an individual the Branchidae must also have an Arcane Connection to that subject. • If a bloodline is the subject the Branchidae needs an Arcane Connection to a bloodline member.</div>
<div>Interpreting the Prophecy</div>
<div>After hearing the vision the Branchidae can interpret the prophecy, which takes about a day, and the result is the prophecy text. The prophecy usually takes the form of a cryptic phrase or analogy. The game effect is that any character who reads (or is told) the prophecy text receives a special Prophecy Point that provides a one-off +3 bonus, similar to a Confidence Point, to a single roll involving the prophecy subject.</div>
<div>For the purposes of copying, a prophecy text is treated like a Laboratory Text with a level of 5. Each prophecy has an expiry. This is also revealed when the prophecy is interpreted and Prophecy Points can</div>
<div>not be spent after the expiry. Typically, a prophecy expires after a year or a decade, but prophecies valid for centuries are sometimes received.</div>
<div>Multiple Prophecies About the Same Subject</div>
<div>No matter how many times a character reads a particular prophecy only a single Prophecy Point is earned. However, a character can read several different prophecies about a single subject and earn a Prophecy Point for each. As a rough guide, Apollo Didyma will only make one prophecy about a grog-level character (he will make another when the previous has expired, however). Up to three prophecies can be simultaneously valid about companion or magus-level characters, and up to six prophecies about characters with Mythic Blood. Usually, only one prophecy can be made about a place, bloodline, or nation, unless it is especially important to Apollo Didyma. If all valid prophecies for a subject have been received then subsequent oracle visions merely repeat previous visions, resulting in duplicate prophecy texts. Duplicate texts do not provide an additional Prophecy Point to the reader.</div>
<div>Prophecies About Faeries</div>
<div>Prophecies about faeries are more effective and provide a +6 bonus (instead of +3). The Branchidae believe this is because Apollo Didyma (source of the prophecies) is a powerful faerie. In fact, it is because prophecies are stories — so faeries actively try to fulfill prophecies.</div>
<div>Manipulating Prophecies</div>
<div>The Branchidae, generally, do not lie about the content of the prophecies. This is because the Branchidae are pagans for whom faithfully transmitting the prophecies of Apollo Didyma is an aspect of religious belief. If the Branchidae do nonetheless lie about a prophecy, then no Prophecy Point is associated with knowing the false prophecy (which is unlikely to be obvious in-character).</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>taining a large forge (now William’s laboratory), but Hector or Achillios may have had secret Merinita cultic motivations too. Achillios left the covenant soon afterward, joining House Verditius at the covenant of Ingasia. Achillios entered Final Twilight in 1170. In 1165, an unusual, Giant Blooded, young boy appeared on the Sacred Way. The boy claimed to be the son of Zeus, and was quickly found be Gifted with a strong vein of faerie blood. A Didyma resident magus, Nicodemus of House Merinita, named the boy Herakles and took him as his apprentice. Herakles continues to reside at Didyma, and is reputed to be the incarnation of his Olympian namesake. Nicodemus entered Final Twilight in 1207. Herakles’ reputation as the demigod was firmly established in the minds of the citizens of Miletos when Panormos (a port town a mile west of Didyma) was plagued in the early 1200s by attacks from sea-monsters. Praying to the saints achieved little, so the elders of Panormos approached Didyma for guidance. The impetuous Herakles promptly volunteered to slay the monsters and led the other younger magi of the covenant, two Branchidae sisters Lydia and Cora, out into a sea boiling with thrashing sea-monsters. Eventually, in 1205 Herakles slew the last</div>
<div>of the monsters, depositing the bloody severed heads of a dozen fearsome creatures in Panormos’ agora. Tragically, both Lydia and Cora were drowned in the quest, although Lydia’s body was never recovered. The sisters’ mother, Nikola (House Branchidae), blames this fatal escapade on Herakles. While Herakles was slaying sea-monsters, great political changes were occurring in the secular world. Between 1204 and 1205 Constantinople was besieged and eventually over-run by Latin crusaders, and with its capital lost the Byzantine court fled to the city of Nicaea. Miletos (in the extreme southwest of the new Empire of Nicaea) also received wealthy refugees from Con</div>
<div>stantinople, among whom was the young Jerbiton maga, Ariane. She was a daughter of a wealthy family and she had lived and was educated among the now exiled imperial elites. Alexander welcomed Ariane, aware that her secular influence may help the covenant in the years to come, and although she is incapable of interpreting the Branchidae prophecies Ariane has converted to paganism, participating in the worship of Apollo Didyma. Ariane remains at Didyma. The fall of Constantinople also preceded the arrival of the Flambeau magus William of Normandy. William followed in the wake of the crusader armies (or so he says), and after the siege he adventured in the Anato</div>

<div>lian mountains, hunting and slaying mythic creatures. While happily engaged in the pursuit of a snake-legged giant (a child of the titan Typhon) William met and befriended Herakles who, having recovered from the sea-monster quest, was likewise hunting Typhon’s spawn. William returned with Herakles to Didyma and has been an official resident of the covenant since 1210. Although William claims to have not directly participated in the siege of Constantinople, Ariane is very suspicious and fearful of him. After the deaths of Cora and Lydia, in 1205, the Branchidae were in crisis, as there were no Gifted Branchidae heirs (in the resident lineage, at least) to follow Alexander and Nikola. Fortunately, in 1211, the clever and Gifted Aoede was born. She is now the apprentice of Alexander.</div>

<h3>Boons & Hooks</h3>

<div>The covenant is described through the following Boons and Hooks: Powerful Ally (Apollo Didyma) (Major Boon): Each Theban covenant has a supernatural patron. For Didyma this is the faerie Apollo Didyma — the aspect of Apollo manifest at Didyma, and source of the Branchidae’s prophecies. It is rare for a covenant’s patron to be a faerie. It is well-known to both magi and mundanes that Apollo Didyma is the patron of Didyma. (Covenants, page 21). Powerful Ally (Metropolitan of Miletos) (Major Boon): Niketas, the Metropolitan of Miletos, is an ally of the covenant. (Covenants, page 21). Edifice (Temple to Apollo) (Minor Boon): The magnificent temples to the old pagan gods at Didyma are well-known. Most locals consider the temples part of the region’s heritage and (even if not pagan) admire the beauty of the buildings, although, of course, a few extremists hate the pagan structures. The temples have been destroyed and rebuilt several times over the centuries, but most date from a rebuilding ordered by the Emperor Trajan in 100 AD. (Covenants, page 14). Increased Aura (Minor Boon): The aura at the covenant is 4 (but a Faerie aura, see later). (Covenants, page 8). Right (Minor Boon): The covenant of Didyma has the right (granted by the city</div>
<div>of Miletos) to conduct prophecies, despite their dubious pagan connotations. (Covenants, page 16). Secondary Income (warehouses) (Minor Boon): The covenant owns warehouses at the Lion Harbor that are rented to the merchants of Miletos. The warehouses are guarded by the turb and are well regarded because of wards against spoilage and vermin. Since the fall of Constantinople there has been an economic boom at Miletos, so this source of income is currently very secure and profitable. (Covenants, page 16). Veteran Fighters (Minor Boon): The covenant has a platoon of experienced fighters split between Didyma and the Miletos warehouses, and enlarged by the addition of William’s Frankish mercenaries. The skill of the Franks is well received but there is antagonism within the turb, as a number of the Greek fighters fought (for the Byzantine emperor) at the siege of Constantinople. (Covenants, page 18). Road (Sacred Way) (Major Hook): The Sacred Way is a paved road, lined with shrines, stretching between the city of Mi</div>
<div>letos and the covenant of Didyma; it takes about 5 hours (at a normal pace) to walk. The Sacred Way is not a secret and everyone who lives in Miletos knows of it. As well as a conventional road, the Sacred Way is an important route from the faerie realm into the mundane world, and it is common for faeries to appear on the Sacred Way. (Covenants, page 9). City (Miletos) (Major Hook): The bustling city of Miletos is 10 miles north of Didyma, and pretty much anything in Mythic Europe can be sourced from its seething ports. If a rare good cannot be immediately purchased, city merchants can find a source within a season for a price. On the other hand, close proximity to civilization means that the covenant cannot easily hide from mundane scrutiny and is thus liable to be enveloped by crises that affect the city, such as wars, politics, and famine (Covenants, page 23). Currently, the negative impacts of the city are minimized, due to the covenant’s ally (the Metropolitan) and it’s Right (which gives the covenant a clear position in the legal and administrative life of Miletos).</div>

</div sidebars>

<div>However, should these ameliorating circumstances be lost, then the covenant’s relationship with the city may drastically change. Monster (Major Hook, Unknown): A powerful demon sleeps in the rocks beneath the covenant. Its previous awakenings were responsible for earthquakes at the site. (Covenants, page 9). Crumbling (Minor Hook): Even the newest parts of the temple structure were built hundreds of years ago, and parts are on the brink of collapse. (Covenants, page 15). Faerie Aura (Minor Hook): The Didyma aura is a faerie aura (level 4). (Covenants, page 10).</div>

<h3>Magi</h3>

<div>The magi at Didyma are Alexander and Nikola (Ex Miscellanea, both Branchidae), Ariane (Jerbiton), Herakles (Merinita), and William (Flambeau). Alexander’s young apprentice, Aoede, also lives at the covenant. William is a metoikos (resident foreigner) in the Tribunal, and since 1210 has been the guest of Herakles (see The Sundered Eagle, page 25). This means William cannot hold offices in the Tribunal, although he may still vote. William’s status as a guest applies to his</div>
<div>Tribunal status: he is considered a full covenant resident under the covenant’s charter. The other magi are all normal members of the Theban Tribunal. Nikola serves as an arche in the current Tribunal Council of Magistrates, and she is a member of the Treasury Council (see The Sundered Eagle, page 25). Alexander, Nikola, Araine, and Aoede are all pagans who, like a number of the coven-folk, dress in the robes of ancient pagan priests and priestesses. Alexander is an ancient, bulky, bearded mass and he disconcertingly vibrates and pulses with a palpable aura. He is the leader (Patriarch) of the covenant and although he now rarely leaves the temple complex, his plotting is responsible for the covenant’s current security with regard to its secular and ecclesiastic neighbors. Alexander’s young apprentice, Aoede is a nervous nine year old girl, who shyly orbits behind him. Nikola, a tall distinguished woman who carries sadness deep in her blank Twilightscarred eyes, is the stateswoman and military leader (Strategos) of the covenant. She is a prolific correspondent with other Theban Tribunal officials and Redcaps, and others often meet with her on Tribunal business. Nikola is always interested in discussing Tribunal affairs with visitors. Ariane is a slender middle-aged woman, and the temple she has converted to a laboratory is shrouded in thick black drapes that grant only fleeting glimpses of the se</div>
<div>crets concealed within. Although reclusive, Ariane is friendly toward characters who trouble to learn about her, but she is fearful and mistrustful of Latin magi. In her role as covenant Chancellor, Ariane extensively uses The Intangible Tunnel to scry on the covenant’s interests and resources, and her familiar, the cat Chloris (a patient, but unpredictable, observer from many of the covenant’s dark corners) keeps Ariane inconsistently informed about the activities of visiting magi. Ariane is typically accompanied by one or more of her handmaidens: a trio of blind women who arrange her mundane affairs. Herakles is strong, giant-blooded magus, and it is common knowledge in the city of Miletos that he is the terrifying incarnation of his namesake. Herakles believes this too, and is exceedingly reckless in his determination to breathe life into his Olympian reputation. He is good friends with the Norman magus William, and the pair often hunt either faerie creatures along the Sacred Way or the monstrous children of the Titans who dwell in the wild Anatolian mountains. William is a Latin knight topped with a burst of red hair that pops and sparks with static discharges. Despite his alien appearance, William is well-liked by mundanes, as he has the Gentle Gift, and he leads a small group of veteran Frankish mercenaries, who are experienced in both mundane fighting and the pursuit of exotic supernatural quarry.</div>

Both her parents are members of the extended Branchidae family.</div>
<div>As she is usually in Alexander’s presence, and he shares his Parma Magica, Aoede does not usually find Gifted magi frightening. Aoede finds Ariane to be endlessly fascinating and she wants to be just like her. Aoede also loves to ride on Herakles’ back like a horse, although she has recently begun to pretend that she is too old to be interested in this. When she is not studying with Alexander, Aoede is allowed to invent spells in his laboratory. Aoede’s Death Prophecy is to die in the dark.</div>

Appearance: Alexander is large, obese bearded man, surrounded by a colored nimbus, about two paces in diameter, and radiating an audible hum. He wears a hooded toga, in the style of a pagan priest. Alexander does not stray far from the Temple of Apollo and his laboratory is built within the temple. He holds the covenant offices of Patriarch and Librarian, and is the head of the Branchidae family.</div>
<div>Alexander’s death prophecy is that he will be slain by his apprentice. His two living apprentices are Nikola and Aoede (cur</div>
<div>rently aged 9). A third apprentice (Cora) was killed in 1205.</div>
<div>Numbness of The Gift</div>
<div>InVi 20 R: Personal, D: Conc, T: Touch When the caster places his hand on another character who has The Gift his hand feels numb. This effect must penetrate the magic resistance (if any) of the target, and if the target is a member of the Order of Hermes casting this spell normally counts as scrying (which is prohibited by the Code). This spell is based on the “detect the traces of powerful magic” guideline. If the target has the Blatant or Gentle Gift the spell still works. (Base 10, +1 Conc, +1 Touch)</div>
<div>Wizard’s Vigil</div>
<div>MuVi 40 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group When Wizard’s Communion (ArM5, page 160) is used to assist casting, the Wizard’s Communion effect must last for the whole casting time of the effected spell. Wizard’s Vigil is a version of Wizard’s Communion with Sun Duration for use with Ritual spells, as for rituals the casting time is 15 minutes per magnitude. For the purposes of calculating the effect Wizard’s Vigil is treated as a Wizard’s Communion two magnitudes lower. The version known by Alexander is therefore treated as a level 30 Wizard’s Communion. Some of the other magi know versions of a different level. (Base 30, +2 Sun)</div>
<div>Staff of Branchidae</div>
<div>Alexander’s talisman is seven-foot-tall wiry staff, made of hornbeam, and allegedly a branch of a tree planted by the founder Branchos more than two thousand years ago. It has been opened with 30 pawns of vis (15 slots used).</div>
<div>Talisman attunements: +6 Vim vs hostile magic, +4 control things at a distance, +4 destroy things at a distance, +3 project bolt or other missile.</div>

Greater Power (20 levels, –2 Might Cost, +4 Init) Awaken the Slumbering Corpse, 0 Points, Init +2, Corpus: As the Hermetic spell (ArM5, page 134), except Range: Touch, and Duration: Sun. Greater Power (25 levels, –3 Might Cost, +2 Init) Human Shape, 1 Point, Init +1, Corpus: Mileta transforms into a tall, skeletal-thin, hairless woman; she retains her fangs. She is of both Corpus and Animal Form when so transformed.

<div>page 120), but also targets humans (Corpus). Lesser Power (15 levels, –2 Might Cost Equipment: None; black hooded toga in human shape. Vis: 3 pawns of Animal in venom sac. Appearance: Mileta is an enormous iridescent-scaled snake, 6 inches in diameter and 20 feet long. She either hides deep in the Sacred Spring, or works (in human shape) in Alexander’s laboratory. When humanoid, she pretends to be an unGifted Branchidae, which few even of the covenfolk realize is a lie. Even fewer realize Alexander’s odd assistant is also the spring snake.</div>
<div>Mileta’s Dark Secret is that she is a demon transformed into a magic creature (centuries ago, long before she met Alexander). Mileta does not know why or how she translated into the Magic realm and in fact retains no loyalty to hell. This is a Dark Secret because many magi would refuse to chance Mileta’s true nature or loyalty. Note that it is impossible for Hermetic magic to be absolutely certain that she is not a demon pretending to be a magic creature, except via PeVi effects such as Demon’s Eternal Oblivion, which at best only reveal that a target is a demon weak enough to be affected by a particular casting. The transformation may have happened via a miracle or some long-lost magic. It is also possible that Mileta may have just been fooled or deluded into believing that she was once a demon. The Familiar Bond was forged with an InMe Lab Total of 35. The Cords are: +1 Gold, +2 Silver, +2 Bronze.</div>

<div>Nikola of House Ex Miscellanea Characteristics: Int +2(1), Per +2(1), Pre +1(1), Com 0, Str +1(1), Sta +1(1), Dex –1, Qik +1(1) Size: 0 Age: 90 (78; –5 Longevity Ritual) Decrepitude: 1 (2) Warping Score: 7 (3) Confidence Score: 2 (5) Virtues and Flaws: The Gift; Hermetic Magus; Death Prophecy*; Branchidae Prophecy*, Education, Hermetic Prestige, Improved Characteristics, Puissant Rego, Puissant Intellego, Self Confident, Warrior; Pagan, Study Requirement, Weak Spontaneous Magic*; Depressed. * House Virtues/Flaws Personality Traits: Sad +3, Loyal +3 Reputations: Tribunal arche 4 (Hermetic), Pagan priest 4 (local) Combat: Fist: Init +1, Attack +2, Defense +4, Damage +1 Strategos Sword: Init +3, Attack +10, Defense +9, Damage +7 Soak: +1 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–5), –2 (6–10), –3 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+) Abilities: Area Lore: Miletos 2 (personalities), Artes Liberales 2 (logic), Awareness 4 (military), Bargain 2 (pilgrims), Brawl 2 (fist), Civil and Canon Law 2 (ancient rights), Code of Hermes 3 (procedures), Concentration 3 (spells), Dead Language: Classical Greek 5 (Hermetic usage), Dead Language: Latin 4 (Hermetic usage), Finesse 3 (items), Folk Ken 2 (Branchidae), Guile 4 (Alexander), Intrigue 4 (Branchidae), Leadership 5 (Branchidae), Living Language: Romaic Greek 5 (dialects), Magic Theory 6 (lab refinement), Organization Lore: Didyma 5 (turb), Organization Lore: Order of Hermes 6 (Theban Tribunal), Pagan Theology 3 (Anatolia), Parma Magica 6 (vim), Penetration 4 (Intellego), Single Weapon 6 (sword), Stealth 2 (temples), Teaching 2 (Hermetic) Arts: Cr 9, In 12+3, Mu 8, Pe 12, Re 18+3; An 9, Aq 6, Au 8, Co 10, He 6, Ig 5, Im 6, Me 7, Te 8, Vi 20 Twilight Scars: Nikola’s eyes are fixed and blank, like those painted onto an Egyptian sarcophagus; this does not affect her vision, but looks very curious. Nikola’s blood is a deep brown color and is mildly acidic (similar to lemon juice). The acidity is noticeable if her blood is tasted or similar, but it does not normally injure Nikola or others. Casting Sigil: A faint, but audible echo precisely one diameter out of phase with her casting. Sometimes it is Nikola’s casting voice that repeats, other-times it is audible components of the spell effect. Further, fainter echoes are potentially accessible to characters with the appropriate InVi spells to recover sigils. Voting Sigil: The Strategos’ sword.</div>
<div>Equipment: Brown hooded stola, Soteria’s hand, Strategos’ sword Encumbrance: 0 (0) Spells Known: Opening the Tome of the Animal’s Mind (InAn 25/+25) Doublet of Impenetrable Silk (MuAn 15/+18) Bind Wound (CrCo 10/+20) Purification of the Festering Wounds (CrCo 20/+20) The Chirurgeon’s Healing Touch (CrCo 20/+20) Whispers Through the Black Gate (InCo(Me) 15/+23) Seven-League Stride (ReCo 30/+32) Tales of the Ashes (InIg 5/+20) The Ear For Distant Voices (InIm 20/+22) Wizard’s Sidestep (variant with Touch Range and Group Target) (ReIm 25/+28) Posing the Silent Question (InMe 20/+23) Tracks of the Faerie Glow (InTe 25/+24) Unseen Arm (ReTe 5/+30) Sense of Magical Power (InVi 2/+36) Piercing the Faerie Veil (InVi 20/+36) Piercing the Magic Veil (Magic equivalent of Piercing the Faerie Veil) (InVi 20/+36) Numbness of the Gift (InVi 20/+36) The Invisible Eye Revealed (InVi 20/+36) Sense of the Lingering Magic (InVi 30/+36) Wizard’s Communion (MuVi 20/+29) Wizard’s Vigil (MuVi 40/+29) Aegis of the Hearth (ReVi 25/+42) Aegis of the Hearth (ReVi 40/+42) Maintaining the Demanding Spell (ReVi 15/+42) The Spell Persists (variant of Maintaining the Demanding Spell with Sun Duration, maintains spells of Level 30 or less) (ReVi 35/+42) Vis: None. Appearance: Nikola is a tall, white-haired woman with a long face and blank eyes (a Twilight Scar), and she dresses wears a brown stola and hood, in the manner of the ancient pagan priesthood. Nikola is a respected member of the Tribunal and serves as an arche on the Tribunal council. She will inherit the role of Patriarch from Alexander, as Matriarch, and is the covenant’s Strategos. In this office, she casts the covenant’s Aegis of the Hearth (level 40). Usually the other magi assist (via Wizard’s Communion) her to cast the Aegis, to ensure that it has sufficient Penetration, but if the others are unavailable Nikola casts a lower level 25 Aegis.</div>
<div>Nikola lives in her laboratory with her husband and servant Alexios, whom she married soon after her daughters Lydia and Cora died; he is aged 43 and is neither Lydia nor Cora’s father. Nikola was shattered by her daughters’ deaths, which she blames on Herakles, but she found some solace in Alexios’ embrace. Alexios has since, privately, come to believe that Nikola, even if not consciously, married him to distract herself from her daughters’ deaths. However, he gives a quiet, brittle smile and denial to any suggestion that his and Nikola’s relationship is not a deeply loving one. Nikola’s Death Prophecy predicts she will die on a full moon.</div>
<div>Soteria’s Hand</div>
<div>Nikola’s talisman is the enchanted, lead plated skeletal hand of Soteria (the first Hermetic Branchidae). It was exhumed by Nikola many years ago, and has been opened with 10 pawns of vis (6 slots used). Talisman attunements: +4 destroy the human body, +4 wards. Talisman powers: The Wound that Weeps PeCo 25 Pen: +0, Unlimited uses R: Voice, D: Momentary, T: Individual As the Hermetic spell (ArM5, page 133). Has no Penetration as the intention is to intimidate mundanes. (Base 5, +2 Voice; +10 Unlimited) Exorcise the Cursed Room PeVi 26 Pen: +22, 24/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Room Demons in the Room lose 5 Might. (Base effect, +1 Touch, +2 Room; +5 24 uses, +11 Penetration 22)</div>
<div>Strategos’ Sword</div>
<div>Nikola also carries the Strategos’ Sword, an invested item and symbol of her office. It was made by the Verditius Orion almost 200 years ago. The long sword was opened for enchantment with 15 pawns (12 slots used).</div>
<div>Ward Against Men ReCo 35 Pen: +0, Unlimited uses R: Touch, D: Diameter, T: Individual Wards the target against people. Nikola must briefly lower her Parma Magica to use this effect upon herself. (Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter; +10 Unlimited)</div>
<div>Arms Multiplied CrTe 38 Pen: +0, 6 uses per day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group Creates 10 duplicates of the sword. The duplicates have no powers, but are effective for mundane use. As magic effects, and thus resisted by Magic Resistance, the swords are of little use against supernatural foes. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group, +1 complex shape; +3 6 uses)</div>
<div>Demon Bane PeVi 40 Pen: +40, Unlimited uses R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual Inflicts 15 Might damage on a demon. (Base 5, +1 Touch; +10 Unlimited, +20 Penetration 40)</div>

He cannot use Quiet, and No Voice is as normal (see ArM5, page 83). Casting Sigil: Heat.

Appearance: Herakles is giant strong-man. He claims to be the son of Zeus, and the incarnation of his namesake. William of Normandy is his guest at the covenant and the pair often hunt magic and faerie creatures together.</div>
<div>Herakles sometimes travels incognito, using the Disguise of the New Visage and Preternatural Growth and Shrinking spells. His favored disguise is as an ancient crone. This disguise doesn’t affect the impact of his Gift but can allow him to pass unrecognized.</div>
<div>Herakles’ Club</div>
<div>Herakles’ club was carved from an ancient oak by Zeus himself. The club is not a magic item, but it is an Excellent Quality item (see City and Guild, page 69). This means that it has improved game statistics</div>
<div>and is slightly larger than usual (hence a higher minimum Strength). Herakles’ Club (Single Weapon): Init: +1, Atk: +4, Dfn: +3, Dam: +3, Str: 0, Load 1</div>
<div>Footsteps on the Sacred Way</div>
<div>InCo 10 R: Road, D: Concentration, T: Individual Locates the position of the target, which the caster has an Arcane Connection to, along a road. Herakles uses this to detect a person walking along the Sacred Way, but it works on any road. (Base 3, +2 Road, +1 Concentration)</div>

Casting Sigil: A yellowy, green fog that briefly emanates from either Ariane herself, or the target of her spell effects. Voting Sigil: A coin-sized, gold locket containing a copy of the icon of St. Loukia (an image of a beautiful woman in a pastoral setting holding a lamb; she is the patron of the covenant of Xylinites: The Sundered Eagle, page 101). Equipment: White hooded stola Encumbrance: 0 (0)</div>
<div>Spells Known: Sense of the Lodestone (InCo 5/+25) Step Sideways (ReCo 15/+36*) Ward Against People (ReCo 30/+26) Leap of Homecoming (ReCo 35/+36*) Seven League Travel Circle (ReCo 35/+36*) Chill Touch of Exposure (PeIg 5/+12) Palm of Hearing (InIm 10/+16) Palm of Seeing (InIm 15/+16) Palm of Speaking (CrMe 5/+14) Wizard’s Communion (MuVi 20/+15) Wizard’s Vigil (MuVi 20/+15) Maintaining the Demanding Spell (ReVi 15/+20) Opening the Intangible Tunnel (ReVi 15/+20) Aegis of the Hearth (ReVi 25/+20) * includes Major Magical Focus Vis: None. Appearance: Ariane is an attractive, slender woman, who usually dresses in a thin white stola (female toga equivalent) and she is the covenant’s Chancellor. She is the daughter of a wealthy Constantinople merchant and was trained in the eunuch school at the politically powerful Jerbiton covenant of Xylinites (in Constantinople). Ariane (a Gifted child with a wealthy father) was eagerly accepted by the Jerbiton, despite her gender. Everything then changed for her when Constantinople fell. Ariane’s father was killed, as was her parens, Theoderic, and Ariane fled into exile, heading for Miletos with one of her father’s trading partners. Xylinites is now a Criamon covenant; see The Sundered Eagle, page 101.</div>
<div>Ariane was welcomed and invited to join Didyma by Alexander, and she has since converted to paganism, but still has contacts in the exiled imperial court at Nicaea, as many powerful eunuchs were her former classmates at Xylinites. Ariane is distressed by the presence of Franks at the covenant, and wishes that William would return to Normandy. Ariane’s Restriction means that she cannot cast when seen by unGifted humans. If unGifted people in her presence close their eyes, or face away from Ariane, then she may freely cast, but secret observers will prevent her from casting. If magic creatures, demons, faeries, mundane animals, etc, observe Ariane casting, this has no effect on her capability to cast. Ariane is married to one of the turb leaders, Sebasten. He does not live with her but regularly visits her bed. Ariane’s familiar is the cat Chloris.</div>
<div>Sense of the Lodestone</div>
<div>InCo 5 R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Individual The caster senses the distance and direction to the target. The caster must have an Arcane Connection to the target. Ariane casts this spell through an Intangible Tunnel. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration)</div>
<div>Step Sideways</div>
<div>ReCo 15 R: Personal, D: Momentary, T: Individual The caster instantly moves to a location she can see within 50 paces. If a Dexterity + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 is failed, then something goes slightly awry: she might be facing the wrong way, or appears a foot or two above the ground. (Base 15)</div>
<div>Seven League Travel Circle</div>
<div>ReCo 35 R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Circle Everyone within the circle instantly moves to a location that the caster has an Arcane Connection to, within seven leagues (21 miles). This is sufficient to travel between Miletos and Didyma. If the caster fails an Intelligence + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9, then something goes slightly awry: the travelers might be facing the wrong way, or appear a few feet above the ground. Items worn or carried by the travelers (armor, weapons, bags, clothes, etc) move too (which requires suitable casting requisites), but large items do not move. For example, a horse in the circle would not travel, nor would a tree, but a marble statuette carried by a traveler would travel (with a Terram requisite). The caster does not need to be within the circle. Note the spell is powerful enough to cause Warping on the travelers. (Base 30, +1 Touch)</div>
<div>Chill Touch of Exposure</div>
<div>PeIg 5 R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual The target shivers like an unwanted baby left alone in a cold and frosty dell. The target loses a Fatigue level. Repeated casting of this spell can cause the character to eventually become unconscious; this usually takes 5 castings (see ArM5, page 178). Ariane has learned this spell to cast down an Intangible Tunnel. (Base 4, +1 Touch)</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>William’s familiar is a large hunting falcon named Torvus, who from his wheeling, soaring vantage provides William with piercing tactical surveillance that extends for miles. A very knowledgeable visitor may recognize that that the pagan priestly regalia worn at Didyma is actually closer to ancient Roman than ancient Greek tradition. This is because the pagans of Didyma, despite claiming (and believing) to constitute a continuous cult spanning two thousand years, have in fact been periodically reinvented after interruptions by Persian, Greek, and Roman conquests, Christian oppression, and other disasters. The most recent reinvention was after the Christian occupation of the site that ended in the 8th century. The pagans of Didyma are thus effectively a second</div>
<div>hand reflection of ancient stories about the oracle cult, created by the faerie Apollo Didyma, who is himself a fantastic mirror of human narratives. This subtle distinction is really only accessible, and meaningful, to characters who are either very well informed about the interaction between faeries and stories or have genuine supernatural knowledge of the distant past. Even native Greeks only know about the practices of their ancient ancestors via surviving stories and depictions on ancient monuments and artifacts, which are frequently not complete, have uncertain dates, and represent a confusing mixture of practices from many native and foreign cultures. Even the extant temples (statues, mosaics, etc) at Didyma were mostly actually constructed under Roman occupation in the first century AD..</div>

<h3>Notable Covenfolk</h3>

<div>Didyma’s covenfolk are mostly Greek. Most are members of the Branchidae family and were born at the covenant, which is a substantial village, but others are from Miletos or other villages in the region. A few Frankish mercenaries form a tiny but boisterous minority.</div>

<h3>Companions</h3>

<div>Companions associated with the covenant include: Callista, the covenant’s representative</div>

<div>InIm 10 R: Touch, D: Diameter, T: Hearing The caster can hear from the perspective of the target. This spell must Penetrate in order to sense creatures with Magic Resistance. Ariane has learned this spell to cast down an Intangible Tunnel. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +3 Hearing)</div>
<div>Palm of Seeing</div>
<div>InIm 15 R: Touch, D: Diameter, T: Vision The caster can see from the perspective of the target. This spell must Penetrate in order to sense creatures with Magic Resistance. Ariane has learned this spell to cast down an Intangible Tunnel. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +4 Vision)</div>
<div>Palm of Speaking</div>
<div>CrMe 5 R: Touch, D: Diameter, T: Individual The caster can form words directly in the mind of the target. The target can recognize the caster’s voice and is aware that the words are not being relayed via their normal senses. Ariane has learned this spell to cast down an Intangible Tunnel. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter)</div>

There is room for another six studs. Vis: 3 pawns of Animal in eyes. Appearance: Chloris is a small, innocuous, tortoiseshell cat, and Ariane’s familiar. She is Cursed by Venus and thus is constantly either pursued by excited tomcats, pregnant, or nursing young kittens. The Delphinion temple (in Miletos) is her favorite site to raise litters and many of the cats of Miletos are her descendants. Some of her descendants may be magical, but many are not. Chloris is very independent, often wandering far from Ariane and not seen for several seasons.</div>
<div>The Familiar Bond was forged with an InAn Lab Total of 26. The Cords are: +1 Gold, +1 Silver, +2 Bronze.</div>

Appearance: William is a magus of House Flambeau, of the school of Ramius, and of the Normandy Tribunal. He has wild red hair, which crackles and sparks with static discharges (a Twilight scar), and is determined to be the greatest hunter of magic and faerie creatures. Since the bloody siege of Constantinople, William has sworn to never kill a human (again). His familiar is a kleptomaniac falcon named Torvus.</div>
<div>William originally came to the Theban Tribunal in the wake of the Crusaders who besieged Constantinople in 1204. He has since befriended Herakles and the pair hunt together. William also commands a small band of mercenaries who followed him from Normandy. William is unmarried and his soldiers quietly joke among themselves about his apparent close relationship with Herakles.</div>
<div>Quell the Scent</div>
<div>PeIm 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual Destroys the target’s scent. This is very useful for stalking animals (and other creatures) that rely on smell. Add +3 to Stealth rolls in such circumstances. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)</div>

<div>William’s Crusade Armor</div>
<div>William’s Talisman is an iron-wrought eagle welded to a steel breastplate. Only the iron eagle (small/metal) is actually enchanted, but as it is a part of armor, it benefits from the shape bonuses of armor (see ArM5, page 97). The talisman has been opened with 15 pawns of vis (8 slots used).</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>at Miletos; Philip, a turb leader; Ella, the oracle; and the local metropolitan, Niketas.</div>
<div>Callista: Arche and representative in Miletos</div>
<div>Callista represents the covenant in Miletos and liaises on behalf of the magi with the city authorities and merchants. She lives in the Delphinion, a palatial re-purposed temple in the heart of Miletos. Callista is well-known to be a pagan, which causes concern in parts of the city; however, it also enhances her perceived status as a representative of the Didyma prophets. She is an arche (a grog leader) and her husband, Cleon, is a Miletos tax official.</div>
<div>Philip: Arche and turb captain</div>
<div>Philip is one of two turb captains (the other is Sebasten, husband of the maga Ariane), and he’s well-liked. Philip is an unGifted Branchidae, and his grandfather was a faerie goblin who served Nicodemus, parens of Herakles. Philip is very serious and dedicated to the turb, but frequently finds the women of the covenant try to distract him from his duties. Unfortunately, his reserve with the women only causes them to redouble their attentions.</div>
<div>Ella the Oracle</div>
<div>As oracle, Ella is accorded respect by the other covenfolk, and she has no other duties at the covenant. On the other hand, Ella</div>
<div>is hypersensitive to whispers that she freeloads on her role as oracle, and thus likes to talk up the importance of her oracle duties. A younger woman, Julia, also has visions and thus sometimes serves as oracle. Ella is jealous and wary of being usurped by Julia. Ella’s Greater Malediction is that via her oracle duties she has become addicted to consuming vis, and suffers Deprivation (ArM5, page 180) if she cannot consume vis. The check time is one month, and the lost Fatigue levels are Long-Term Fatigue levels that can only be regained after she has consumed a pawn of vis.</div>
<div>Niketas Metropolitan of Miletos</div>
<div>Niketas is the politically powerful met</div>

Among his hoard are documents which reveal corruption by the tax officials in Miletos unbeknown to William, Torvus is using this information to blackmail the head tax official, Leander.</div>
<div>Torvus is a fast flyer and has a +3 bonus to rolls involving speed. The Familiar Bond was forged with an InAu Lab Total of 20. The Cords are: +1 Gold, 0 Silver, +2 Bronze.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>ropolitan (archbishop) of Miletos. He is a companion and ally of covenant, but his close relationship with the covenant is not well known, even at the covenant. Of course, Niketas does not actually live at the covenant, but at his Episcopal Palace (in Miletos). See External Relationships, later, for more details.</div>

<h3>Grogs</h3>

<div>There are over 100 grogs and other specialists living at the covenant. These include:</div>
<div>Ariane’s Blind Maidens</div>
<div>Ariane’s Restriction prevents her casting when seen by unGifted people. As a result, she shuns the covenfolk, except her three servants, who were were blinded so as to not interfere with her magic. This may seem cruel, but Ariane (educated alongside eunuchs in Constantinople) blandly views her servant’s blindings as a component of office. Generally, the covenfolk respect and admire the sacrifice made by Ariane’s blind maidens. Ariane’s blind maidens are Magarethe (who was Ariane’s servant at Constantinople) and Nicola and Eleni (who were young girls blinded soon after Ariane arrived at Didyma 16 years ago).</div>
<div>The Turb</div>
<div>The turb consists of 18 fighters (The Standard Soldier; ArM5, page 22), and two leaders. Philip is one of the leaders (see Com</div>
<div>panions), The Grizzled Veteran (ArM5, page 21) is used for the other (Sebasten). There are also four Frankish mercenaries. Usually, two bands, each of four men, are based at the Miletos warehouses (one band on-duty, the other off-duty), with the remainder at the covenant. The warehouse fighters serve in Miletos for a week, before trading places with a covenant band. The Frankish mercenaries are treated like the other bands and take a turn at warehouse duty.</div>
<div>William’s Frankish Mercenaries</div>
<div>William of Normandy is accompanied by a band of four grizzly-bearded, troublemaking Franks, named Marcel, Thomas, Alain, and Guy. The mercenaries are not bad men and are loyal to the covenant and William. However, they cannot communicate well with the other covenfolk and thus spend far too much down-time drinking together</div>

Perhaps because of his bravery, Marcel is very sensitive to accusations of cowardice. Despite communication problems, he is married to Lyra, the beautiful young daughter of a goat farmer whose farm is located an hour’s walk from the covenant. Lyra lives with Marcel at the covenant.</div>

<h3>Covenant Organization</h3>

<div>The majority of the covenant, including the magi, are based in the temple complex at Didyma. The covenant also owns warehouses in Miletos, where it is represented by a companion, Callista. The metropolitian of Miletos is an ally of the covenant, although his relationship with the covenant is not well known. Strangers arriving at the covenant are met by an arche (one of the leaders of the grogs), usually Sebasten or Philip (the turb leaders), or Callista (in Miletos). Either the Patriarch (the leader of the magi, Alexander) or the Strategos (the maga responsible for defenses, Nikola) is summoned to greet strangers identified as magi or otherwise exotic. The Strategos issues tokens for the Aegis.</div>
<div>The majority of covenfolk dress, act, and speak indistinguishably from the Greek citizens of Miletos. The magi tend to dress in the anachronistic hooded togas of pagan priests of the Roman-era. The covenant welcomes visitors, particularly pagans, and is hospitable to all magi, except those with bad reputations who are treated with distrust.</div>

<h3>Hierarchy and Governance</h3>

<div>The covenant is governed by the Council of Magi, which is led by the Patriarch (see elsewhere for charter and details). The covenfolk are governed by their own subservient Council of Archai which meets once a month to decide most issues related to mundane resources. Visiting magi are generally expected follow the wishes of their hosts. Visiting grogs and companions are expected to follow the directions of the Council of Archai.</div>
<div>The Council of Archai</div>
<div>The Council of Archai decides issues like turb training, gathering lab supplies, and mundane interactions. The council members each have the title arche (mirroring the structure of the Theban Tribunal) and each of the five archai serve for five years. The archai’s terms are staggered so that one retires, and a new one is elected, every winter solstice at the covenant’s mid-winter feast. Council decisions are made by majority vote, with each arche having an equal vote. The current archai include:</div>
<div>Magarethe: the longest serving arche in the current term (who hence holds the office of archon: leader of the council). Magarethe is one of Ariane’s blind maidens (see earlier). Callista: represents the covenant in Miletos. Sebasten: turb captain and Ariane’s husband. Basil: a scribe and the oldest (non-magus) member of the covenant. Philip: another turb captain.</div>
<div>Income and Supplies</div>
<div>The covenant gains income by conducting prophecies and other rituals for the Christian inhabitants of Miletos and the surrounding villages. Although clearly pagan in origin, these rituals have been retained as local “Christian” rites. This heterodox prac</div>
<div>tice is frowned upon by some priests, but the Metropolitan Niketas has prevented serious censure of the covenant. The covenant also holds imperial decrees, dating from the second century AD, which grant the Didyma oracles license to conduct prophecies. These decrees are still considered to be legally valid in Miletos, and 10% of the oracle fees are tithed in tax to the city treasury (perhaps explaining the tolerance of city officials). Additional income is received by renting warehouses at Miletos to merchants, who are very aware that their landlords are the Didyma oracles. The covenant’s agent, Callista, in fact charges a premium because the merchants’ wares are protected by magic wards. The covenant’s usual clients are Greeks, but currently one warehouse is being used by a Venetian cartel.</div>
<div>The Charter of the Council of the Magi of Didyma</div>
<div>The covenant’s charter was drafted by Soteria in 990, and draws upon ancient Branchidae traditions. Its principle terms are:</div>
<div>• The Patriarch/Matriarch is the most senior, resident, Gifted Branchidae. This is currently Alexander. • All resident magi meet in a Council of</div>
<div>Magi on the winter and summer solstices. A magus becomes resident by majority vote at a Council of Magi, or by being gauntleted by a resident magus. The Patriarch can revoke residency at any time and a magus absent for more than five consecutive solstices is deemed to have resigned residency and any offices. • Extraordinary Councils of Magi may be called by the Patriarch with at least one Moon’s notice. • Each resident magus owes one season of covenant service each year, which must be approved by the Patriarch. Alternatively, a magus can pay a residency fee of 3 pawns of Vim vis per year (to the coffers). The season of service can be deferred, but for no longer than the date of the next Tribunal meeting. • The Patriarch must present to the Council of Magi a prophecy for the covenant, at the council immediately preceding a Tribunal meeting. • The Patriarch appoints a resident magus to the office of Chancellor (currently Ariane), who is responsible for the collection and storage of the covenant’s vis stocks (the coffers). The Chancellor may trade vis from the coffers with resident and visiting magi, but the coffers</div>
<div>must gain, or break-even, numerically on any trade. The Patriarch and Strategos may requisition vis from the coffers. The Chancellor must report on the coffers at the Council of Magi. • The Strategos (currently Nikola) is a resident magus, appointed to office by the Patriarch, who is responsible for the covenant’s defenses, mundane and supernatural, including the Aegis of the Hearth. The Strategos has the sole right to distribute Aegis tokens. The Strategos nominally leads the turb and is responsible for its training, but Nikola has delegated these roles to qualified covenant servants. • The Librarian (currently Alexander) is a resident magus appointed to office by the Patriarch, and is responsible for the storage and copying of books and lab texts, and deciding disputes over access to books. The Librarian must also recruit and train the scriptorium (a pool of scribes). • The covenfolk govern themselves via a Council of Archai, who are elected by covenfolk for five year staggered terms. The longest serving archai, the archon, represents covenfolk at the Council of Magi. • Decisions are made via a majority vote.</div>
<div>Each resident magus and each office has a vote. There are no proxies, so voters must attend.</div>
<div>Votes at the Council of Magi</div>
<div>Currently there are 10 votes on the council. These are distributed as: Alexander 3 (Patriarch, Librarian, resident) Nikola 2 (Strategos, resident) Ariane 2 (Chancellor, resident) Herakles 1 (resident) William 1 (resident) Magarethe 1 (covenfolk archon)</div>
<div>Agenda for the Council of Magi</div>
<div>The typical agenda of the council is: • Attending resident magi name themselves and any offices they hold. • Other magi (and others) attending name themselves and their relationship to the covenant. • Any current prophecies involving the covenant or the magi are discussed by the council. If this council is the one immediately preceding a Tribunal meeting, then the Patriarch presents a new prophecy. • If needed, votes are held for new resident magi. • Each of the Chancellor, Strategos, Librarian, and archon (covenfolk leader) reports on the discharge of her office, which is discussed by the council. • Each resident maga reports on her executed and proposed covenant service, which is approved by the Patriarch. • The Patriarch confirms existing officeholders, or names new ones. • Any other issues are raised by resident magi and others.</div>

<h3>Covenant Buildings</h3>

<div>The main part of the covenant is at Didyma. The covenant also owns property in Miletos.</div>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<div>Geographically, Didyma is an uninspiring flat, dry plain, less than 100 paces above sea level. Crossing the plain is a regular, paved road, marked every half mile with a saint’s shrine. This Sacred Way stretches from Miletos, about 10 miles to the north, makes a brief diversion to the fishing town of Panormos and terminates, in the center of the Didyma plain, in a craggy hollow split from the limestone rock. The natural geography is uninspiring, but the man-made geography is spectacular. Reaching out of the hollow, slicing long black shadows over the plain, is a collection of tall, marble-columned, pagan temples. The largest, the temple to Apollo, is over 20 paces tall and, despite having foundations in a hollow, can be seen for several miles across the flat Didyma plain. The hollow depression that the temples are built within is about five paces deep, further accentuated and defined by a retaining wall. This wall is the Boundary target for the Aegis of the Hearth.</div>

<h3>Main Structures</h3>

<div>Most of the main structures at Didyma are ancient temples in varying stages of ruin.</div>
<div>Apollo’s Temple</div>
<div>The largest temple is the enormous temple to Apollo, built on a base 50 paces by 100 paces (45,000 square feet), topped by a stone forest of over 100 columns, each 20 paces tall. The temple is mostly open to the air, but the central structure is enclosed, and divided into three sections. Two enclosed sections form Alexander and Nikola’s laboratories, the third section (between the two laboratories) is the covenant library and scriptorium. As well as books and Hermetic laboratory texts, the library contains a record of the many thousands of prophecies that the Branchidae have made over the millennia. Most of the prophecies concern relatively trivial issues (from the perspective of magi), such as the best time for a village to harvest a crop, or the outlook for a marriage between two Miletos families, or the predicted fortunes of a deal between merchants. The majority of the dusty prophecies have already come to pass, or are now moot as they concern individuals who lived and died centuries ago. As well as images of gods, especially Apollo, there are many life-size statues and</div>
<div>frescoes of wild animals, mythic and mundane, within the temple. Such animal frescoes are unusual for a Greek temple, and probably reflect the large number of mythic beasts that follow the Sacred Way into Mythic Europe.</div>
<div>Sacred Spring</div>
<div>In the heart of the Temple to Apollo, in an open air section bordered by a crumbling wall, is the Sacred Spring. The spring feeds a square pool about 500 square feet in area, 1 pace deep, and is an important vis source for the covenant. The waters of the Sacred Spring are also a component when the magi petition Apollo Didyma for prophecies.</div>
<div>Athena’s Temple</div>
<div>This well-maintained temple is shrouded in thick black drapes that snap and crack in the wind and make it impossible to observe activities inside (usually overcoming Ariane’s restriction). Like all the covenant’s smaller temples, Athena’s temple is built on a stone, stepped, platform about two paces high with an area of about 3,500 square feet with 10-pace-high columns around the perimeter that support a roof. The roof covers two large cella (rooms) flanking a central hall. The temple contains Ariane’s laboratory and the coffers (the covenant’s vis stocks). Usually, only Ariane and her blind handmaidens are found inside.</div>
<div>Zeus’ Temple</div>
<div>The ground outside Zeus’ Temple is littered with the bones of fantastic creatures, and exotic pelts are stretched to cure, in the hot sun, between the columns. The temple is structurally sound, but has much minor damage. This temple contains the laboratories of Herakles and William, and William’s Frankish mercenaries camp in the central hall.</div>
<div>Temples of Dionysus and Hermes</div>
<div>These temples are damaged fallen columns and headless and missing statues but are sometimes used as stores by the covenfolk. The Temple of Dionysus once housed the laboratories of the sisters Lydia and Cora (both killed in 1205), and if visitors to the covenant require laboratory space, these will be offered.</div>
<div>The Baths</div>
<div>The baths were built during the Roman period, and the complex consists of a central domed hall with two wings. Originally both wings contained baths, fed by a system of pipes that connect to the Sacred Spring, but, by 1220, the eastern wing baths have been filled in and that wing is now used by the covenfolk as living quarters. The central domed hall is the covenfolk’s meeting, storage, and work area. The western wing baths are functional and tiled in exquisite mosaics of pagan gods and myths. The western baths are fed by the Sacred Spring, but the Roman-era system of boilers to heat the waters has been replaced by Hermetic enchanted items. All of the covenfolk bathe regularly in the warm bath waters, which gives the covenfolk a +1 Living Modifier to their aging rolls.</div>
<div>The Large and Small Round Altars</div>
<div>In front of the Temple to Apollo stand two round altars carved with images of gods and titans. The original function of the altars has been lost to the Branchidae, and today the large altar (about 7 paces across, and a pace high) is used as a Certamen dueling circle; the opposing magi stand on the altar’s rim. The small altar (3 paces across and a pace high) has no particular use.</div>
<div>Ruined Temple and Church</div>
<div>There are two collapsed buildings at the covenant: Hera’s temple, which collapsed in the early seventh century,  and a church built by Emperor Theodosius in the fifth century. The church was the heart of a small colony of monks living at Didyma. It collapsed in an earthquake in the late 800s and the chapter of monks relocated to Miletos. The elderly monk Basil, now a pagan convert, and a few young monks sent from Miletos by the metropolitan live in a still-standing corner of the church.</div>
<div>The Covenant Wall</div>
<div>The covenant lies in a hollow in the Didyma plain. The hollow’s perimeter is edged by a stone retaining-wall about five paces tall. The wall is too high for cavalry to traverse and is treacherous for heavily armed soldiers. For characters climbing the wall make a Dex + Athletics roll (encumbrance due to armor applies) against an Ease Factor of 9; failing</div>
<div>characters fall and take +10 damage. The wall is also the target for the covenant’s Aegis of the Hearth (level 40 cast by Nikola). On the eastern side of the covenant, five large, wide steps (each one pace tall, two paces deep, and 50 paces wide) led from the covenant-basin up to the plain. Characters on foot can traverse these steps without penalty, but for mounted characters make a Dex + Ride roll against an Ease Factor of 6. A wooden crane is used to lift bulky items into and out of the covenant-basin (Zeus’ Arm; an enchanted item, see later).</div>

<h3>Laboratories</h3>

<div>All of the residents of Didyma have personalized their laboratories in some way.</div>
<div>Alexander’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Alexander’s laboratory is watched over by Apollo Didyma, and is larger and better equipped than a standard Hermetic laboratory. It also contains a gallery from which his young apprentice Aoede can observe without interfering in the laboratories activities (70 BP). Virtues and Flaws: Greater Guardian (Apollo Didyma; +3 In); Gallery (+1 Teach), Lesser expansion (+1 In) Characteristics: Size +1, Refinement +4, General Quality +1, Upkeep +2, Safety +8, Warping +1, Health 0, Aesthetics +2 Specializations: In +4, Teaching +1</div>
<div>Nikola’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Nikola’s laboratory is large and luxurious; she lives right within her experiments with her husband Alexios. There is sufficient space for the large specimen collections (currently animal bones) necessary for her Study Requirement, and it takes Nikola at least a season to swap the specimen collection. Unfortunately, the laboratory is rather dominated by an enormous statue of the founder Branchos (80 BP). Virtues and Flaws: Greater Feature (Branchos statue; +3 In), Palatial (+1 In, +2 Teach); Living Quarters, Specimens (+1 An); Greater Focus (Branchos statue; +4 In) Characteristics: Size +1, Refinement +4, General Quality 0, Upkeep +4, Safety +2, Warping 0, Health 0, Aesthetics +5 Specializations: An +1, In +8, Teaching +2</div>
<div>Ariane’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Ariane’s laboratory is dark and poorly lit with smokey candles; thick black drapes block out the light. When Ariane fled Constantinople she brought with her a vis still (which helps to extract vis from the aura) and a lot of unglamorous, but quality equipment (40 BP). Virtues and Flaws: Greater Feature (Vis still; +3 Vis extract.); Superior Equipment (+1 Vis extract.); Defective Lighting, Undecorated (–1 Vis extract.) Characteristics: Size 0, Refinement +2, General Quality 0, Upkeep 0, Safety +2, Warping +1, Health 0, Aesthetics 0 Specializations: Vis extraction +3</div>
<div>Herakles’ Laboratory</div>
<div>Herakles’ laboratory is watched over by his father, Zeus, and because of Herakles’ giant size he treats the laboratory as cramped. For anyone else the laboratory is an Awkward Shape instead (increase General Quality and Upkeep by 1, but remove the Score in Spells specialization). Herakles offers animal sacrifices (of mutton fat) to Zeus on the solstices and equinoxes to keep his laboratory functioning (30 BP). Virtues and Flaws: Greater Guardian (Zeus; +3 Re); Cramped (Spells +1), Sacrifices (+2 Re) Characteristics: Size 0, Refinement +1, General Quality –1, Upkeep +1, Safety +3, Warping +2, Health –1, Aesthetics –3 Specializations: Re +5, Spells +1</div>
<div>William’s Laboratory</div>
<div>This laboratory was originally outfitted by the Verditius magus Orion, in 1020, so a prominent feature is a large forge. William wonders whether the feature is more annoying than useful (40 BP). Virtues and Flaws: Greater Feature (forge; +3 Items), Specimens (magic creature skeletons; +1 Vi); Guard (mercenaries); Greater Focus (forge; +4 Items) Characteristics: Size 0, Refinement +1, General Quality –2, Upkeep +1, Safety 0, Warping 0, Health 0, Aesthetics +4 Specializations: Vi +1, Items +7</div>
<div>Abandoned Laboratories</div>
<div>The two abandoned laboratories have been stripped of most equipment (50BP each). Virtues and Flaws: Basic Characteristics: Size 0, Refinement 0, General Quality –3, Upkeep 0, Safety 0, Warping 0, Health 0, Aesthetics 0 Specializations: None</div>

<h3>Associated Properties</h3>

<div>The covenant’s buildings in Miletos are clustered at the edge of the Lion Harbor (one of two harbors in Miletos). This huddle of dockside temples and warehouse does not lie under an Aegis of the Hearth, but the warehouses are protected by enchanted items.</div>
<div>The Warehouses</div>
<div>These three warehouses stand adjacent to one another at the Lion Harbor; each has solid, well-ventilated, stone walls, a wooden roof, and a footprint of 5000 square feet. Each warehouse is protected by a Vermin Ward, Ward Against Rot, and a Pestilence Ward. The covenant also owns a dock large enough to unload substantial ships. The warehouses and dock areas have a Divine aura of 2. There are usually 8 members of the covenant’s turb (see The Turb) stationed at the warehouses who have access to 5 Defender Swords. There are also usually a dozen porters and teamsters at the busy warehouses, who are hired as needed from the citizens of Miletos by Callista (see Covenfolk). These workers are unlikely to have met the remote magi. The covenant also keeps a magic dredge (The Oracle’s Dredge), two small, archaic cedarwood boats, and half a dozen Porter’s Helpers at the warehouses.</div>
<div>The Delphinion</div>
<div>Behind the covenant’s warehouses is a simple, well-preserved, but defunct, stone temple. This was the Delphinion, the start of the Sacred Way, and is now the residence of the covenant’s representative, Callista, her husband (Cleon, a tax official), two teenage children, and a small staff of six domestic servants. Callista carries a wand (Warning Flame, see later) that she can use to signal the covenant proper, when needed. The Delphinion is a lacuna with a Faerie aura of 4.</div>

<h3>External Relations</h3>

<div>The covenant has established relationships with its supernatural, Hermetic and mundane neighbours.</div>
<div>Apollo Didyma</div>
<div>Apollo Didyma is the patron of the covenant and he physically manifested here in ancient times, but this has not oc</div>
<div>curred in recent centuries. He appears to reside in the Faerie realm at several places, including Olympos. Apollo’s main agenda is the furtherance of the worship of the pagan gods and foiling the plots of the servants of the titans. He protects the Branchidae by sending prophecies to warn of danger, and very occasionally responds directly by sending intermediaries down the Sacred Way to represent him. Apollo is not particularly interested in the wider Order of Hermes, whom he refers to as “the priests of Hermes”.</div>

<h3>Sphinx</h3>

<div>Faerie Might: 20 (Auram) Characteristics: Int +2, Per +2, Pre –1, Com +1, Str +4, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik –2 Size: +2 Virtues and Flaws: Increased Faerie Might; Faerie Sight, Faerie Speech, Lesser Power (Hound), Hybrid Form, Improved Characteristics, Personal Power (Flight), Personal Power (Shriek of the Impending Shafts); Narrowly Cognizant; Monstrous Appearance, Sovereign Ward (riddle solver), Wrathful; Visions Animal Qualities: Accomplished Flyer, Aggressive, Ambush Predator, Tough Hide Personality Traits: Treacherous +6 Reputations: Merciless hunter and riddle teller 3 (local) Combat: Claws: Init –3, Attack +9, Defense +7, Damage +6 Grapple: Init –2, Attack +6, Defense –3, Damage n/a Teeth: Init –2, Attack +9, Defense +4, Damage +5 Soak: +4 Wound Penalties: –1 (1–7), –3 (8–14), –5 (15–21), Incapacitated (22–28), Dead (29+) Pretenses: Athletics 5 (flying), Awareness 4 (prey), Brawl 5 (claws), Faerie Lore 5 (riddles), Faerie Speech 5 (riddles), Hunt 4 (prey), Stealth 4 (stalking), Survival 3 (Didyma plain) Powers: Faerie Sight: This power allows the sphinx to automatically distinguish mundane things from glamor, to automatically identify another faerie’s glamor, and to automatically see an Arcane Connection (and know to whom it is an Arcane Connection, if that person is present). She can also use Faerie Sight to determine the motives and goals of other faeries (Awareness + Perception roll against an Ease Factor equal to Might of other faerie / 5). See Realms of Power: Faerie, page 50 for more details.</div>
<div>Faerie Speech: This power allows the sphinx to duplicate the language spoken by her human audience. See Realms of Power: Faerie, page 50 for more details. Flight, 0 points, constant, Auram: The sphinx can fly and carry in her claws (or as a rider) another character of up to Size +1. (Personal Power; 25 spell levels) (Base 4, +2 Sun, +1 Constant; +10 two intricacy points to reduce Might Cost) Hound, 1 point, Init –10, Corpus: The sphinx knows the direction and distance to her quarry. (Lesser Power; 25 spell levels) (Base 3, +4 Arcane, +1 Concentration; +5 one intricacy points to reduce Might Cost) Shriek of the Impending Shafts, 0 points, Init –4, Herbam: As per the Hermetic spell (ArM5, page 136). (Personal Power; 25 spell levels) (Base 2, +2 Sun, +3 Hearing; +10 two intricacy points to reduce Might Cost) Equipment: None. Vis: 4 pawns of Auram in wings. Appearance: The sphinx has a lion’s body from which grows the upper torso and head of a woman (like a feline centaur), and she has the wings of an eagle. The sphinx hunts lone travelers on the Sacred Way, but avoids groups. Her favored tactic is to swoop onto her prey, grab him (successful grapple), gain altitude, and then drop him from a height. Each round, carrying a character, she gains 20 feet in altitude, and a falling character takes +1 Damage per two feet he falls (see ArM5, page 181).</div>
<div>The sphinx’s Sovereign Ward means that she cannot harm a character who solves her riddle, and she must offer a riddle if a character requests one. Herakles and William hunt sphinxes (for vis), and a sphinx is a possible familiar for a Merinita magus. The sphinx can receive oracle visions from Apollo Didyma, if she drinks the sacred water at the covenant.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>The Sacred Way</div>
<div>The Sacred Way stretches about 10 miles between Miletos and Didyma, making a brief diversion to the town of Panormos, a mile to the north-west of Didyma. The Sacred Way is paved in stone blocks about one pace square, and the road varies between five and seven paces wide. In ancient times, shrines to gods, statues of sphinxes and other beasts, statues of Branchidae patriarchs, and mausoleums of important Miletos citizens were dispersed along the Sacred Way. In 1220, most of these have been dismantled and instead Christian shrines stand at half mile intervals. The Sacred Way has a Faerie aura of 1, except for the shrines which have a Divine aura of 2. Practically any faerie from Realms of Power: Faerie or other supplements can use the Sacred Way to enter the mundane world. The magus Herakles also appeared as a child on the Sacred Way, and several Merinita have tried to find a route back along the Sacred Way into the Faerie realm. Perhaps the Merinita Orion, who disappeared in 1053, found the backwards route. A common sort of faerie that appears on the Sacred Way is the sphinx.</div>
<div>Miletos</div>
<div>The ancient port of Miletos was founded more than two thousand years ago, and was the site of Mythic Europe’s first planned town (laid out in a grid). Long before Rome rose, Miletos was a powerful trading center, albeit eventually eclipsed by cities like Athens, and it was the home of the first philosopher: Thales of Miletos. Miletos is sometimes called Palatia (city of palaces) as it is littered with ancient stone temples and administrative buildings, although the temples have long since been re-purposed. The walled city covers a rocky peninsula and has two main gates (the Sacred and Lion gates) that open to the mainland. It has two harbors (the Lion Harbor, protected by a gated sea-wall, and the Theater Harbor) and fresh water still flows along a Roman-era aqueduct. In 1220, Miletos’ population is several thousand, but the ancient population was much larger, so there are many abandoned buildings (and a ruined Roman-era wall) south of the current city walls. Stone and space for construction is thus easily available. Following the siege of Constantinople many wealthy, refugee Greek merchants fled</div>
<div>to Miletos, heralding an economic boom. There are also busy Venetian, Arabic, and Jewish quarters. Of course, everyone knows that Venetian merchants conspired to cause Constantinople’s fall, but business is business, so trade between the Italians and others is both substantial and profitable. However, beneath lies a black seam of antagonism, which occasionally erupts into street violence. All four groups Greek, Italian, Arab, and Jew use Miletos as a distribution hub for goods from Constantinople, North Africa, the Orient, and the rest of Mythic Europe. The covenant is a well-known and open presence in Miletos, but the magi rarely travel into the city. Despite its pagan reputation, the covenant is tolerated because of Didyma’s long history of interaction with Miletos, and because the covenant’s ally, the metropolitan, discourages serious questioning. The covenant’s magically warded warehouses are valued by all the merchants.</div>
<div>The Strategos at Miletos</div>
<div>The regional imperial Nicaean administrator, responsible for a large provincial hinterland that includes the covenant, is the Strategos. He is an intelligent, middle-aged man named Anakletos, who, when Constantinople fell, was a capable, young military officer and son of a wealthy Constantinople family. He found himself rapidly promoted to Strategos, in the far-flung Miletos province, following the devastation of the Byzantine army by the crusaders. The Strategos’ fortress consists of ten towers centered around a large courtyard, and is built on a hill in the middle of Miletos overlooking Theater Harbor. The fortress stands on the site of the Roman-era theater, which was converted to its current military use more than 500 years ago, but only a few long-lived individuals (such as Apollo Didyma) remember the theater beneath the fortress. Nominally, Anakletos commands a regional military force of ten infantry taxiarchia (each numbering 1,000 soldiers, including archers, heavy and light infantry), and two 3,000 strong moria (heavy cavalry). However, due to substantial losses over the last few centuries, these formations only exist as accounting fictions in the city’s ledgers. The actual Miletos garrison (although still large for the city’s current size) consists of barely 100 infantry and 100 cavalry. Anakletos also employs around 100 Latin mercenaries (Franks and Italians) to</div>
<div>man the city gates, and as marines to patrol the nearby sea lanes for pirates. Ironically, some of the older mercenaries laid siege to Constantinople 16 years ago. Including mercenaries and levies from the villages in the provincial hinterland (including the covenant), Anakletos can raise a total force of about 3,000. However, assembling such a substantial force takes a season and leaves the countryside totally defenseless. Anakletos knows of the covenant, and</div>

<h3>Story Seed: Taxation Audit</h3>

<div>The covenant’s relationship with its tax official, Cleon, means there are few taxation issues for the covenant. However, Cleon discovers the Nicaean court has become suspicious of the head tax official Leander and is sending a delegation to audit tax activities in Miletos. Cleon has done nothing wrong, but knows his closeness to the covenant will appear dubious to the imperial auditors. The real danger is the unknown attitude of the auditors to the pagan activities at Didyma, and the attitude of Leander’s successor (if he is replaced). The player characters could try to deal with the audit of Cleon’s activities in isolation, or they could help Leander dodge the audit, which will earn his gratitude.</div>

<h3>Recent Ecclesiastic Rulers of Miletos</h3>

<div>The Didyma covenant has a long history of interference with the ecclesiastic rulers of Miletos, which ensures that the covenant’s pagan practices can continue.</div>
<div>Archbishop Nikephoros (965-969) Archbishop Epiphanios (969-1013) Archbishop / Metropolitan Michael (1013-1170)* Metropolitan Niketas (1170)** Metropolitan Nikephoros II (1170)** Metropolitan Niketas II (1172present) * Michael, a precocious unGifted Branchidae (nephew of Soteria), was elected archbishop as a teenager and due to a Longevity Ritual lived for an exceedingly long time. His intrigues raised the archdiocese to a metropolis. ** Niketas and Nikephoros II were both hostile to the idea of pagans residing at Didyma, and both died suddenly after being elected metropolitan. There was no metropolitan in 1171 due to an inability to form a quorum of canons.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>has even received a fearsome prophecy of a Muslim invasion. Anakletos knows that the oracles are members of a regional league of semi-pagan sorcerers (his perception of the Theban Tribunal), but he has much to worry about with pirates, fear of an invasion, and disputes between his Latin mercenaries and Greek soldiers, and so is content to leave the covenant alone. Anakletos moved in the same social circles as the maga Ariane in Constantinople (although he is not a eunuch), and he knows that she now lives at Didyma.</div>
<div>The Kommerkiarioi</div>
<div>Kommerkiarioi are tax officials, who evaluate and tax goods arriving at the port at a rate of 10%. Half of the tax is sent to the imperial capital, Nicaea, and the remainder funds the local military forces and other official expenses. Taxed goods are labeled with an imperial seal, which indicates the good should not be taxed again (within imperial</div>
<div>cities). Tax officials must also supervise when goods are split into smaller lots, as this breaks the tax seals and otherwise the goods will be re-taxed when moved. Forging tax seals is punishable by death (perhaps commutable to a heavy fine in some circumstances). The head kommerkiarioi, Leander (a greedy, tall, bald man with piercing eyes), is well known locally to be corrupt, although nothing has been proven (yet) in Nicaea. Many merchants pay Leander bribes to be taxed at a low rate. The covenant’s warehouses at the Lion Harbor are within the jurisdiction of the kommerkiarioi Cleon, who is the husband of Callista (the covenant’s representative in Miletos). Unlike Leander, Cleon is honest and careful to ensure all goods in the covenant’s warehouses are taxed correctly although he does not inquire too closely into the provenance of goods already bearing his colleagues’ seals. Cleon is also the tax official responsible for the covenant. He travels to the covenant once a year to assess its tax (10% of the oracle fees).</div>

<h3>The Church</h3>

<div>Miletos has a long history of Christianity, and the region is firmly within the Greek church, although there are some Latin clergy who conduct the Roman rites in the Venetian quarter of the city. Among other doctrinal differences, the Greek church does not accept the pope, in Rome, as the sole leader of the church. There is also a long underground tradition of paganism in the area, largely due to the presence of the Branchidae. Many Miletos citizens thus mix a few half-remembered pagan traditions into their nominally Christian rites. This includes a tradition of traveling along the Sacred Way (stopping at the now Christian shrines) to receive a prophecy for events like weddings, births, and important business decisions. One of the earliest Miletos bishops (Kaisarios Eusebio) was a delegate at the Council of Nicaea in 325, where many Christian doctrines were agreed under the supervision of Emperor Constantine. In 538 bishop Hyakinthos was raised to an archbishop, and in the early eleventh century the archbishop Michael successfully campaigned for Miletos to be raised to the rank of metropolis. Metropolitan is a higher rank within the Greek church than archbishop, but the distinction is virtually meaningless to the Latin church. The current metropolitan (elected in 1172) is an ancient cripple named Niketas. He was once a monk and is personally pious but ambitious. He is tolerant of the pagan magi at Didyma and respects the magi’s expertise with supernatural problems. Indeed, Niketas and Alexander are good friends and correspond regularly by letter. Alexander cultivated this friendship many years ago, and he used magic to interfere and ensure his friend Niketas’ election as bishop. Niketas also convalesced for a season in the baths at Didyma, following an illness in 1194, and Alexander created a Longevity Ritual for him. Niketas is indebted to the covenant, especially Alexander, for his high station and long life and he uses his influence to discourage serious questioning of the pagan influences at Didyma.</div>
<div>Panormos</div>
<div>A mile northwest of Didyma, bounded by the turquoise sea, is the port of Panormos, with a population of just under one thousand. Many of the townsfolk are unGifted Branchidae family members and the Chris</div>

Commanding Aura also gives Niketas a Magic Resistance of 10 and a Soak bonus of +2. Saint Nikephoros’ Journey, 3 Faith points, Init +2, Corpus: Equivalent to the Hermetic spell Leap of Homecoming (ArM5, page 135). Equipment: Relic of Saint Nikephoros (ring), crosier (crooked staff), pallium (scarf), clerical robes. Encumbrance: 0 Appearance: An old cripple hidden deep within coarse clerical robes. The relic of Saint Nikephoros is a fragment of bone inset into the archbishop’s ring. It has the power Saint Nikephoros’ Journey and a Faith Score of 1, giving Niketas a total Magic Resistance of 20.</div>
<div>Niketas cannot walk (but can crawl) and so is usually encountered seated on his throne in the episcopal palace, and when he needs to travel is carried around by a pair of young, strong monks.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>tian covenfolk travel to Panormos churches each Sunday to celebrate mass. Many townsfolk also make the reverse journey to seek prophecies from the Didyma oracles. There are Arab traders in Panormos, who are rumored to buy (and then sell on) plundered goods from the pirates who occasionally raid the Miletos shipping lanes. The townsfolk of Panormos are aware of the covenant: the Sacred Way passes the town, and the covenant temples are clearly visible from their homes. It is also wellknown that the magi, led by the terrifying</div>
<div>demi-god Herakles, slew a number of seamonsters that plagued the town in 1205. The weathered skulls of a dozen of the monsters are still hung from the arch that straddles the main road heading east (which connects to the Sacred Road just outside the town).</div>
<div>The Coast and the Didyma Plain</div>
<div>Along the coast are six small fishing villages, and there are dozens of small farming communities scattered over the Didyma plain. Each has less than 100 inhabitants</div>
<div>and (outside fish) the local produce is mostly grains, vegetables, and goats. Virtually all of the villagers are Christians who attend weekly mass in either Miletos or Panormos. However, many also travel once or twice a year to Didyma to receive traditional prophecies. The covenant is well-known and largely well-considered, but the magi and oracles are considered very odd.</div>
<div>Agamenoth</div>
<div>Agamenoth is a demon prince slumbering beneath the Didyma plain. His physical forms are a gigantic earth elemental and a long seam of black coal. Agamenoth caused the earthquake that destroyed the church and monastery at Didyma centuries ago, but has since been sleeping in his coal form. However, he was awakened by Constantinople’s fall, and when fully conscious he will cause earthquakes that damage Didyma and Miletos.</div>

<h3>Hermetic Relationships</h3>

<div>Theban covenants must have specific purpose (see The Sundered Eagle, page 27); Didyma’s is to make and interpret prophecies. Historically, the covenant helped the Tribunal to avoid much damage during the Schism War, and magi embarking upon important ventures still sometimes travel to Didyma for a prophecy.</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>Agamenoth: Prince of the Moving Earth</div>
<div>Order: Aerial Power Infernal Might: 40 (Terram) Characteristics: Int +1, Per 0, Pre +3, Com 0, Str +10, Sta +4, Dex +1, Qik –1 Size: +5 Confidence Score: 1(3) Virtues and Flaws: None Personality Traits: Fury +6 Reputations: Demon Prince of Earthquakes 3 (infernal) Hierarchy: +8 Combat: Fist: Init –1, Attack +12, Defense +10, Damage +10 Soak: +20 Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–10), –3 (11–20), –5 (21–30), Incapacitated (31–40), Dead (41+) Abilities: Athletics 5 (leap), Brawl 10 (fist) Powers: Coagulation, 3 points, Init –1, Terram: Agamenoth can form a physical body (see Realms of Power: Infernal page 31). His preferred physical forms are a giant earth elemental, with black-cracked skin that stinks of sulfur (statistics given), or a deep black seam of coal several hundred paces wide and long. Envisioning, 1 point, Init 0, Mentem: Agamenoth can appear in the dreams of a character (see Realms of Power: Infernal page 32). Lord of Moving Earth, variable, Init –1, Terram: Agamenoth can duplicate any named Hermetic Creo, Muto, or Rego Terram non-ritual spell from ArM5. The Might Cost is the magnitude of the spell. Move Through Earth, 0 points, constant, Terram: Agamenoth can move through earth (or stone) without penalty. Obsession, 1 point, Init –5, Vim: Whenever a character sins in his presence, Agamenoth can infect the character with the Personality Trait: Fury +1; see Realms of Power: Infernal page 31. Whenever a botch is rolled for a char</div>
<div>acter with this trait, roll an additional number of botch die equal to the value of the Personality Trait. If these die botch, the character enters a furious rage (see Fury, ArM5 page 54). Recalcitrance, 0 points, Init, Constant: for any Hermetic Rego effect, including wards (and equivalent supernatural powers of any realm), Agamenoth is treated as if his Might is 60. Stir the Sulfurous Earth, 10 points, Init –1, Terram: By using this power Agamenoth causes an earthquake, which also releases a stench of sulfur. The earthquakes triggered by Agamenoth cause extreme shaking within an area one mile in diameter, for a simple die worth of rounds. During each round of shaking, characters within the area must make a Dex + Athletics roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to avoiding falling over. For each vulnerable structure within the area (stone buildings, etc), make a single stress roll against an Ease Factor equal to the number of rounds of shaking, and add +3 to the Ease Factor for buildings more than 2 stories tall. Structures that fail this roll collapse. Characters inside collapsing structures take +15 damage due to falling masonry and may be trapped underneath the rubble. Outside the area, the earthquake can be felt for a distance of 100 leagues (300 miles) but causes no real damage. Agamenoth must Penetrate the the Magic Resistance of the area that suffers damage, so Aegis of the Hearth normally protects a site. Equipment: None. Weakness:  Abhors water (causes no damage, but Agamenoth must flee water or spend a Confidence Point to remain in its presence for a diameter). Vis: 8 pawns of Terram in skin. Appearance: Agamenoth appears either as a gigantic black mound of earth and rock with sulfur leaking from cracks in the surface as it forms limbs and heads as needed, or as pitch black seam of coal.</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Children of Olympos</div>
<div>The Children of Olympos is a Theban league that seeks to forge close relationships between magi and faerie gods (see The Sundered Eagle, page 125). Obviously, with an oracle and pagan temples, Didyma is of great interest to the league. League members frequently arrive at the covenant seeking to worship or contact the faerie gods. This pilgrimage may be a part of the league’s Mystery Initiation scripts. Herakles sympathizes with The Children of Olympos, although he is not a member, largely because he already considers himself to be a faerie god. The league would dearly like to recruit Herakles. Ariane is also sympathetic to the league and perhaps interested in joining.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>The Kretan Phyle</div>
<div>Theban covenants are grouped in regional units called phylai (see The Sundered Eagle, page 25). Didyma belongs to the Kretan phyle (alongside Alexandria, Favonius, and Polyaigos). Phylai are administrative, so membership does not imply a common political or mystical outlook. However, covenants of a phyle obviously have regional interests in common. In the Kretan phyle the main common interests are the mundane shipping lanes and Didyma’s prophecies of Muslim invasion. Each phyle is represented by four magi (archai), on the Council of Magistrates, which administers the Tribunal. Nikola is one of the Kretan archai, and she serves on the treasury council, as a “tutor” with the duty of identifying the Gifted (but un-apprenticed) children of the Tribunal (assisted by Alexandria’s Redcaps). Nikola’s tutor role is important for Didyma, as it should allow Nikola to recover lost Gifted Branchidae from the line of Bastards. Favonius is a flotilla of ships rather than a fixed location and was only founded 50 years ago (see The Sundered Eagle, page 83). The ships of Favonius sometimes moor in Panormos, and the magi occasionally visit Didyma. The covenant of Alexandria (see The Sundered Eagle, page 112) is about 75 miles north of Miletos and was founded about 100 years after the Branchidae converted to the Order of Hermes. Alexandria is a Mercere covenant and the current bureaucratic hub of the Tribunal. The Redcaps regularly travel to Didyma. There is only one Gifted magus at Alexandria, a Bonisagus maga named Catella, who like Ariane was trained in Constantinople but left around the time of the siege. Ariane and Catella know each other well, although they rarely meet in person. The Branchidae Tessa lived for almost four decades at Alexandria, but left in 1140 for an unknown destination, and she is assumed to be in Final Twilight. Her apprentice supposedly continued the line of Tessa, but his name and fate are unknown at Didyma. There are several unGifted Branchidae, descendants of Tessa’s servants, at Alexandria. Polyaigos was also founded about 100 years after Didyma on an island 150 miles southwest (see The Sundered Eagle, page 88). Many of Polyaigos’ magi are hoplites and two Branchidae magi, Nestor and Io (the line of Damen), are known to live at Polyaigos.</div>
<div>Other Theban Covenants</div>
<div>The Verditius covenant of Ingasia and the Merinita covenant of Aegaea have good relations with Didyma. Herakles’s grand-parens was a magus of Aegaea.</div>

The covenfolk paddle around the Lion Harbor once every month to clear it, otherwise, the harbor</div>
<div>will visibly silt up within a season and be unusable within a decade. The mundane authorities and merchants know that the covenant performs this service for Miletos (and has done so for more than two hundred years). (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Part; +10 Unlimited)</div>

<div>ReTe 15 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Individual These handles are activated when clamped to the side of a heavy object, and allow the user to easily move the object (as if he had Str + 5; similar to The Unseen Porter, ArM5, page 156) These assist moving loads at the Miletos warehouses. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration; +5 item maintains concentration, +5 24 uses per day)</div>
<div>Defender Swords</div>
<div>ReTe 20 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Individual An active Defender Sword allows the wielder to automatically “parry” incoming blows from metal weapons. The wielder must be aware of the incoming attack, so he can still be stabbed in the back. However, in normal melee he can automatically “parry” any number of blows in a round. The wielder must maintain concentration to use the item, but maintaining his awareness of incoming melee blows does not require a Concentration roll (as that is how the item is designed to be used). On the other hand, if the wielder attempts to do something else in the round he must make a Concentration roll (see ArM5, page 82). Maintaining concentration while attacking in the same round requires a Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 15. The Didyma turb often fight in pairs, and one grog uses a Defender Sword to defend his partner (see ArM5, page 173). The defended grog can thus freely attack, while the defender “parries” all the blows aimed at the pair. The covenant has ten of these swords. Five are usually carried by the warehouse garrison, while the others are kept at the covenant. (Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Metal; +10 Unlimited Uses)</div>
<div>Zeus’ Arm</div>
<div>ReTe 30 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Individual This wooden crane is enchanted with an effect to easily allow bulky objects to be lifted in and out of the covenant-basin. The objects rest on a square platform with an area of about 50 square feet, and a weight of up to 100 tons can be lifted. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Size; +5 item maintains concentration, +10 unlimited uses)</div>
<div>The Spice Wand</div>
<div>InVi 12 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual This wand vibrates slightly if it touches vis. It is used to search the Arab spice market in Miletos for vis. (Base 1, +1 Touch; +10 Unlimited Uses)</div>
<div>Vis Divining Rods</div>
<div>InVi 20 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Hearing This pair of silver rods is activated by being held outstretched, like divining rods, and allow the user to hear when he is within 30 paces of vis. A Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 narrows down the location of the vis to about 1 foot. (Base 1, +1 Touch, +3 Hearing; +10 Unlimited Uses)</div>
<div>Diamond of Hermes</div>
<div>InVi 25 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual When this diamond is touched by a Gifted person it glows brightly. Nikola made this item to aid her duties as a tutor on the Tribunal’s Treasury Council, and it is also used to identify Gifted Branchidae. Nikola allows the Redcaps from the covenant of Alexandria to borrow the diamond to confirm rumors of Gifted children. (Base 10, +1 Touch; +10 Unlimited Uses)</div>
<div>The Vis Net</div>
<div>ReVi 20 Pen +0, 24/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual When this net is cast into water containing vis, the vis coalesces as pulsating, translucent crystals that can subsequently be untangled and removed from the net. Each slimy crystal is about fist-sized and contains 1 pawn of vis. (Base 10, +1 Touch; +5 24 uses)</div>
<div>Pestilence Ward</div>
<div>ReVi 34 Pen +12, constant effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Structure These wards prevents minor demons of Might 10 and less from entering the Structure to cause illness and damage. These wards protect the Miletos warehouses.

<h3>Vis Sources</h3>

<div>Ariane, as covenant Chancellor, is responsible for vis harvesting, but she usually delegates to grogs equipped with suitable items. William and Herakles eagerly see to the Hunt. The covenant vis sources (all reg</div>
<div>istered with the Redcaps) are given below. The vis sources are worth a total of 220 BP.</div>
<div>Arab Market</div>
<div>5 pawns Muto vis per year (25 BP). Some spices in the bustling, scented Arab market contain vis and Callista regularly uses the Spice Wand (see items) to search the market for the vis-rich spices. Some years, more than 5 pawns of vis is found.</div>
<div>Harvest of Aftonsitiron</div>
<div>7 pawns Creo vis per year (35 BP). Aftonsitiron is a small village, a mile north of Miletos, that has fertile soils and abundant barley harvests. Some of the barley contains vis, which the covenant grogs search for by walking through the swaying fields with the Vis Divining Rods. The lucky farmers who grow the vis are paid one silver coin per pawn by the covenant. The farmers are perfectly happy with this arrangement as one silver coin for a handful of barley stalks is a fabulous price.</div>
<div>Hunt</div>
<div>Variable pawns of Form vis per year (80 BP). Every summer faerie animals leave the Sacred Way entering the Didyma plain, and are then hunted by Herakles and William for their vis. This source is worth a variable amount depending on the creatures hunted. Unless the troupe has a story need for particular faerie creatures (for example, if the player characters are hunting) roll two simple dice three times to determine the vis gathered. The first die in each pair indicates the vis Form type (1 = Animal, 2 = Aquam, etc) and the second die indicates the number of pawns of that type. The total haul of vis therefore varies between 3 and 30 pawns. It is faerie tainted.</div>
<div>Mouth of the Meander River</div>
<div>3 pawns Aquam vis per year (15 BP). North of Miletos is the mouth of the Meander river, the source of the silt that the covenant clears from Lion Harbor. In spring, the river floods a large delta-plain, and the first flood waters contain 3 pawns of Aquam vis. The Vis Net is used to collect this vis, and the timing of the flood waters is predicted astrologically by Ariane (Int + Artes Liberales (astronomy) roll against an Ease Factor of 6). Grogs usually do the actual collection.</div>
<div>Sacred Springs</div>
<div>13 pawns Intellego vis per year (65 BP). The Sacred Springs (within the covenant enclosure) are worth 13 pawns of Intellego vis per year (one pawn each full moon). Ariane collects this vis with The Vis Net.</div>

<h3>Vis Stocks</h3>

<div>The vis stocks (the coffers) are held in chests in a large room in the temple to Athena. Individual pawns are stored in bronze coins, stamped with the Art glyph, and the Order’s glyph on the obverse. Ariane usually transfers the vis from its raw form into the coins (1 pawn per coin). In total there are about 100 coins of each Art available as a substrate for stored vis, and the coins were made in the eleventh century by Orion of Verditus. The coins are specifically designed to hold vis and this prevents any weird reactions or contaminations between the concentrated stock of vis. Some of the pawns, however, are faerie tainted.</div>
<div>The current stocks are (29 BP): Creo: 13 pawns Intellego: 45 pawns Muto: 12 pawns Perdo: 0 pawns Rego: 3 pawns Animal: 8 pawns Aquam: 6 pawns Auram: 1 pawn Corpus: 7 pawns. Herbam: 13 pawns Ignem: 8 pawns Imaginem: 0 pawns Mentem:0 pawns Terram: 5 pawns Vim: 24 pawns</div>

<h3>Wealth</h3>

<div>The covenant has 100 Mythic Pounds worth of mundane wealth (10 BP).</div>

<h3>The Covenant in Play</h3>

<div>The covenant of Didyma comes to life in your saga when you play it.</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Story Seed: Spice Harvest</h3>

<div>The Arab market vis is, probably, only a small fraction of the potential harvest, with the remaining vis arriving in markets in Constantinople, Athens, Venice, etc. The player characters may think to follow the spice to its source and thereby capture a much greater vis source. Of course, this will potentially disrupt the vis sources of magi living near these other markets, angering those magi. Alternatively, another covenant (or non-Hermetic forces) could do the same, cutting the Miletos supply.</div>
</div sidebars>


<h3>Covenant Theme</h3>

<div>The theme of Didyma is responding to change. The covenant’s current situation relies on numerous threads, such as the small numbers of Branchidae, the tolerance of city and church officials of the pagans supported by the covenant, Agamenoth remaining slumbering beneath the covenant, and the city of Miletos’ continued status as a provincial trading port. Should one of these threads snap, the magi will need to scramble to maintain the covenant as it is, and even a single failure may push the covenant into ruinous winter. The arrival and meddling of new magi (perhaps, the player characters) could also be an impetus for change.</div>
<div>Player Character Roles at Didyma</div>
<div>All of the described resident magi, companions, familiars, and grogs at Didyma are suitable as player characters. Additional player character magi of any age may be easily added to the covenant, or could replace some or all of the described residents. For each additional (or replacement) magus the troupe should consider the circumstances of the character’s arrival at the covenant. Was the player character magus trained at Didyma (like the Branchidae and Herakles) or did he arrive later in life (like William and Ariane)? Player character Branchidae are likely apprentices of Alexander or Nikola, or contemporary to these magi. Branchidae might also be returned members of the lines of Tessa, Damen, or Bastards. The oldest (Gifted) Branchidae (currently Alexander, aged 129) should hold the title of Patriarch (or Matriarch), so if this is not the case, then the reason should be explained by the troupe. Additional magi residing at the covenant (regardless of House) means that the number of votes at the Council of Magi and who fulfills each office should be adjusted. This could change the balance of power within the covenant, and potentially away from the Branchidae: Alexander and Nikola currently hold the majority of the power and will resent it if newcomers do not support them.</div>

<h3>Suggested Storylines</h3>

<div>Storylines at Didyma can include the following. Of course, your troupe can mix elements of the storylines during your saga.</div>
<div>A Sanctuary</div>
<div>The covenant does not change. Autumn persists and the covenant’s long shadow stretches through the years without the direct intervention of the player character magi. The Patriarch Alexander continues to lead the covenant and his interference in the metropolitan’s court is unchecked. War does not significantly impact upon Miletos. Aoede grows up. If Alexander dies, then he is smoothly replaced by Nikola. Herakles and William are willing to join the player characters in adventures anywhere in the Tribunal. Ariane’s familiar Chloris either openly or secretly accompanies expeditions back to Constantinople, reporting back to her mistress about her former home, and Torvus (William’s familiar) occasionally steals the player characters’ possessions. This storyline frees the troupe to concentrate on the stories of your own characters. The covenant is a safe, and well resourced place to convalesce, research, and train, and sometimes a setting for stories. However, the covenant is not the dominant focus of your saga.</div>
<div>The Branchidae</div>
<div>This storyline concerns the politics of the Branchidae tradition. Alexander dies. His natural successor as the fifth Patriarch is his filia Nikola, the next oldest resident Branchidae. However, matters are not so clear. The lines of Tessa or Damen technically should have taken over the covenant when Alexander’s parens, Jason, entered Final Twilight over ninety years ago, but the young Alexander prevented his elders’ return to Didyma. Tessa and Damen have since reputedly entered Final Twilight, but Damen’s filius Nestor is older than Nikola and returns to challenge her right to the office of Patriarch. Nestor of Polyaigos is of the line of Damen and older than Nikola by several years. When he learns of Alexander’s death he secretly travels to Miletos, and sends his daughter Io (also of the line of Damen), and a Flambeau ally (Kaia; also from Polyaigos) to Panormos. Nestor plans to learn what he can of the covenant’s situation from Miletos, in the weeks prior to the solstice. In particular, he wants to learn about the condition of the Tessa and Damen wards, and he will hire agents in Miletos, tasking them to travel to Didyma to extinguish the ward flames (see later). Afterwards, Nestor intends to travel to the covenant for the Council of Magi, to claim his title of Patriarch. Meanwhile Io and Kaia will wait in Panormos, ready to travel to Didyma should conflict occur</div>
<div>between Nestor and Nikola. If serving as a background character, Nikola is very reluctant to cede the title of Patriarch to Nestor: Nikola has already waited her whole life for Alexander to die. Nikola questions whether Nestor is in fact her elder or even a descendant of Damen at all. The player characters may need to support one or other faction (and perhaps face the consequences of supporting the wrong party). It may be possible to prove the primacy claims with magic (age and descent are specific facts about a body that can be determined with Intellego Corpus effects). Nestor and Io carry Arcane Connections to each other to easily communicate and to rapidly travel to each others’ location, if needed, with Seven-League Stride effects. The Tessa and Damen Wards: When Jason entered Final Twilight and Alexander seized control of Didyma, the only other resident was the Merinita maga Lana (grand-parens of Herakles). Lana, who entered Final Twilight in 1179, was about twenty years older than Alexander and was an expert in bloodline magics. She, with Alexander’s assistance, cast two ward spells that prevented Tessa, Damen, and their descendants from entering the covenant. Unbeknown to Nestor, these wards were accidentally destroyed in the 1190s. So there is actually nothing to prevent Nestor’s return. Nikola does not know about the wards, unless Alexander reveals information prior to his</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>The Tessa and Damen Wards</h3>

<div>ReCo(In) 60 R: Touch, D: Fire, T: Boundary, ritual Cast into a flame, this ward prevents a person of a bloodline from crossing the boundary. This requires an Arcane Connection to the primogenitor of the bloodline, like the faerie Target bloodline does. The ward’s duration lasts until the flame is extinguished, or until the Arcane Connection expires. If a fixed Arcane Connection is used, and the flame is tended, this ward can last indefinitely. Despite its high level, the effect will likely have a high Penetration due to the caster being able to also use the Arcane Connection for Penetration. Casting with Wizard’s Vigil will also greatly improve the spell’s Penetration. The Intellego requisite is required to detect the bloodline (a specific fact about a person). (Base 15, +1 Touch, +3 Fire, +4 Boundary, +1 Intellego Requisite)</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>death. The wards were cast into flames burning in bronze braziers (see insert) and warded the covenant boundary against Tessa’s and Damen’s bloodlines. After Lana cast the effects, Alexander kept the braziers burning in his laboratory. However, when the braziers were accidentally extinguished Lana had already been lost to Final Twilight, and the effects could not be recast (or reinvented) by Alexander. Possibly, Lab Texts for the wards are among Lana’s effects, which are held by Herakles. Nestor knows about the wards from information that his parens Damen gathered many years ago. Aristocles the Wanderer is the filius of Tessa. He was trained by her at the covenant of Alexandria, and also outranks Nikola (but is younger than Nestor). Aristocles’ name and fate is unknown at Didyma, and he is in fact no longer in the Theban Tribunal, having spent many years wandering Mythic Europe. He is currently a member of the Transylvania Tribunal living at the oppidum of Tablinum (north of Constantinople on the shore of the Black Sea at the mouth of the Danube; see Against the Dark, page 58). After Alexander’s death, Aristocles also returns to Didyma, but does not arrive until several years after Nestor. Aristocles is not concerned about the Patriarch title, and if Nikola has retained the title, then Aristocles is content</div>
<div>to cede it to her. Aristocles is accompanied by a trio of Tremere (Anica, Octavian, and Petre). The four magi from Transylvania intend to take up residency at Didyma, and willingly accede to any residency requirements made by the Council of Magi. The four Transylvanians appear keen to learn about the Branchidae pagan cult, and whether it has anything to offer the mainstream Order. However, Aristocles has secretly renounced Branchidae pagan-cult practices and believes that the worship of Apollo Didyma should cease. The secret purpose of Aristocles and his Tremere allies is to research and eventually slay the faerie Apollo Didyma. Aristocles and his allies intend to declare Wizard War on the rest of the Didyma magi when he is ready to slay Apollo Didyma. This, he believes, will protect him from any legal claim that he has deprived the covenant magi of magical power or similar; such a legal claim might otherwise arise because the slaying of the covenant’s patron effectively destroys the covenant’s legal standing in the Theban Tribunal. Of course, a Wizard War declaration will not protect Aristocles from the political consequences of slaying Apollo. Researching how to slay Apollo Didyma is probably supported by the leaders of House Tremere. However, as actually assassinating the faerie god has obvious potential to trig</div>
<div>ger a crisis in the Order, going through with carrying out the assassination might not be the intended, official task of the vexillation accompanying Aristocles. On the other hand, House Tremere, or a faction within it, might be quite willing to brazenly spark confrontation in the belief that the Order and House Tremere will benefit in the long term. Erginos the Argonaut (the issue of union between a Branchidae woman and Poseidon) was a skilled ocean navigator in the ancient world and a crewman on the legendary journey of the Argo, which voyaged prior to the Trojan War. Eriginos is still alive, the captain of the Apeiro, and voyaging with a crew of heroes on the eternal oceans of the faerie realm. When Aristocles returns to Didyma, Apollo Didyma quickly realizes that Aristocles’ true purpose is to slay the faerie god. Accordingly, Apollo appeals for help from his allies among the player characters, and sends an ancient trireme for them to the port town of Panormos. This ship, the Diakopho, is crewed by 200 faerie “ghosts” of dead Branchidae, chaperoned by a squadron of talkative dolphins, and can sail into the faerie realm. Apollo tasks the player characters with locating Eriginos and the Apeiro within the vast faerie oceans and to convince Eriginos to sail his company of heroes back to the mundane world, to defend the god against Artistocles and his Tremere allies. If the player characters in fact support Aristocles, then Apollo instead recruits among the loyal unGifted Branchidae residents of Panormos. The player characters then learn of the quest (which they may chose to interfere with), either when the Diakopho departs from Panormos or when the Aperio and the hero Eriginos return.</div>
<div>City, Church, and War</div>
<div>This storyline concerns interactions between the covenant and the mundane world. The magi at Didyma are able to conduct their pagan cult fairly openly under the guise of “augmenting” local Christian practices with traditional rituals. This is largely due to the willful blindness of the elderly metropolitan Niketas II. The Metropolitan Niketas II dies, and the clergy of Miletos (and its hinterland) begin to gather at the episcopal palace, in Miletos, to elect a new metropolitan. Quorum for the election is 20 voters, and there are 35 possible voters (comprising 25 priests from Miletos, 3 priests from Panormos, 5 abbots, and 2 priests from larger hinterland villages). The winner must take at least two thirds of the cast votes, and if no candidate has enough votes, votes are recast the following day, with further votes the next day, and so forth,</div>
<div>as required until a candidate has sufficient votes. The leading contenders are Father Christos and Father Yannis, who are both priests in Miletos. Christos (a middle-aged and charismatic priest) is Alexander’s (and Niketas’) intended successor, and he is an unGifted member of the Branchidae family. His branch of the family is Christian and has lived for generations in Miletos, but he supports Niketas’s relaxed attitude to the activities at Didyma. Yannis (an old and sarcastic theological debater) was formerly a deacon in Constantinople, and fled to Miletos following the crusade. Yannis is appalled at the tolerance afforded to dangerously heretical “traditional” practices in Miletos. If he claims the episcopal throne, Yannis will replace the local priests whom he considers corrupted by pagan heresy with imports from Nicaea (exiles from Constantinople, like himself). Yannis then intends to preach against the traditional oracle rituals conducted at Didyma, and ultimately will attempt to try the “priests” at Didyma as pagans. Yannis may also turn to the small enclave of Latin clergy (in the Venetian quarter of Miletos) for assistance in prosecuting dangerous pagans. Yannis’ probable program as metropolitan is fairly obvious, so the Branchidae pagans at Didyma try to interfere to either ensure that Christos wins the episcopal throne, or that Yannis’ reign as metropolitan is short-lived. Many of the existing local priests (whom Yannis intends to replace) are potential allies of the Branchidae. Depending on the circumstances of your saga, the player characters may instigate, aid, or resist such interference. If Yannis is deposed or loses the epsicopal elections he (or his surviving allies) appeal the election to Manuel, the Patriarch of Constantinople (in exile at Nicaea). Unlike the pope, the Patriarch has no real powers to overturn episcopal elections, unless there are clear procedural problems, so the best he can really do is send a delegation to investigate allegations of heresy. Rights to conduct prophecies, as granted in an imperial decree dating from the second century AD, are an important asset of the covenant, and give substantial legal backing to the ongoing use of traditional prophecies by Miletos Christians. Unfortunately, a set of new, formerly lost decrees are presented to the Strategos’ court. These decrees date from the 300s AD and explicitly outlaw the practice of prophecy at Didyma. If found to be genuine, these imperial decrees are difficult for the Strategos to ignore, so if the player characters want to continue the pagan-cult at Didyma (and retain the income from collecting oracle fees), they will need to demonstrate that the new decrees are forgeries, or find some other way to influ</div>
<div>ence the Stategos and his court. If they do not support the Didyma pagans, then the player characters may need to prevent Alexander and the other Branchidae from attempting to suppress this inconvenient information. The new decrees may have been discovered (or in fact forged) by the covenant’s enemies, who may include: the metropolitan candidate Yannis; the exiled Branchidae, Aristocles; mercantile rivals; or even the player characters. Quaesitors arrive in Didyma to investigate allegations of either recent interference in the episcopal elections, historic interference when Niketas II was elected, or interference in the Miletos legal courts. The player characters may be suspected by the Quaesitorial investigation or, alternatively, the player characters could take the role of the Quaesitorial investigators. Venetian merchants, who occupy part of the docks and warehousing at Miletos (and lease a warehouse from the covenant), start to import Frankish mercenaries to act as “guards”, and begin to aggressively poach property from the Arab, Jew, and Greek quarters. Several fires are blamed on the Venetians, as is the “accidental” scuttling of a barge that renders the Theater Harbor (used by Greek and Arab merchants) inaccessible for a number of weeks. The Strategos’ soldiers are then forced to break up a riot by Greek and Arab laborers that targets a Latin church (near the Delphinion). The Latin priest has been badly injured in the riot and the Strategos is afraid that if he dies, then the pope will send a company of Templar Knights to defend the Venetian quarter. The arrival of Templars would be seen by many Greeks (and welcomed by the scheming Venetians) as the beginning of an invasion. The Strategos requests that the Didyma magi use their magic to heal the priest and to also help to contain the ongoing tensions created by the Venetians. The situation is complicated further, as due to the ongoing decline of the Nicaean empire, the Strategos’ own military forces are partly composed of Latin mercenaries, so he is not entirely confident of his own soldiers’ loyalties. The Seljuk Sultanante of Rum (in the south east corner of the Theban Tribunal) invades the coastal periphery of the Nicaean Empire. Miletos is not itself attacked, but bedraggled refugees from further south arrive in crowded ships to the Panormos and Miletos ports. As Miletos had a much larger population in ancient times, there is plenty of space on the periphery of the city for the refugees, who create a slum on the mainland, just outside the current city walls. Due to his stretched resources, Miletos’ Strategos has difficulty maintaining order in the slum, and there is also a regional food shortage</div>
<div>due to the influx of hungry refugees. Eventually, chasing rumors of the oracles’ wealth, a mob of several hundred starving refugees walk along the Sacred road to the Didyma temple complex and demand to be fed by the covenant. In anticipation of further attacks, the Strategos begins to draft a milita from the Miletos hinterland. He expects Didyma’s turb to enlist, and the covenant to provide magical assistance. Meanwhile, a well-known Arab merchant who lives in Panormos, Omar Allaid, travels down the Sacred Road to Didyma. Omar is acting as an emissary of the Seljuk Sultanante and offers to allow the Didyma pagans a license to continue their pagan worship under new Muslim overlords, but only if they provide magic assistance for an upcoming sea-borne assault on Miletos. The covenant must choose whether to support the Miletos Strategos, or Omar Allaid. Both military leaders are skeptical of claims that the “Code of Hermes” prevents interference. If the magi do nonetheless claim neutrality, then regardless of whether Muslim or Greek forces prevail, the magi will quickly find that their pagan-cult is outlawed by the victors.</div>

<h3>Moving Didyma to Other Tribunals</h3>

<div>Didyma can be moved to other locations that border the Mediterranean (including the Rome Tribunal, parts of the Iberian Tribunal, North Africa and the Middle East), as it is plausible for an ancient temple to Apollo to have been built in such locales. The Language, Area Lore Abilities, and other region-specific details of the characters should be adjusted as appropriate. The demon Agamenoth can lie slumbering beneath the covenant wherever it is located, but the other external relationships of the covenant will need to be rethought depending on its new locale. The covenant’s pagan practices are tolerated by the local ecclesiastical and secular authorities. This situation could arise anywhere in Mythic Europe as it really depends on the personalities of the local authorities. Note that in the case of the ecclesiastics this situation has arisen because of deliberate manipulation by the covenant to cause the election of favorable clergy; this can potentially happen anywhere in Mythic Europe. Alternatively, the covenant could be moved into a secret regio or merely be very remote and isolated. Such isolation might also allow the pagan cult to flourish, but may reduce the impact of the nearby city upon the covenant, and may reduce the opportunity for the covenant to collect income via the city.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Sleeping Beast</div>
<div>This storyline revolves around conflict with the long-sleeping, earthquake causing demon Agamenoth (see earlier), who lies beneath Didyma. He was disturbed by the fall of Constantinople more than fifteen years ago, and has since slowly been waking. Although Agamenoth knows of, and dislikes, the pagan temples at Didyma, he is not deliberately attacking the covenant. His “plan” is merely to cause violent destruction. A massive earthquake strikes causing damage to many buildings in Miletos (see Agamenoth). Characters inside the collapsed buildings take +15 damage from falling stones, and must be dug out from underneath the ruins. Rescuing trapped characters may be trivial if magi with sufficient Terram magic are available, but otherwise it takes many hours (perhaps days) of manual labor to shift the rubble. The next season another earthquake strikes. These earthquakes are caused by the awakened Agamenoth, and there is stench of sulfur in the dusty air billowing around the ruined buildings. Agamenoth continues to cause earthquakes every few seasons until he is destroyed. Agamenoth is unlikely to be able to penetrate the covenant’s Aegis with his powers, so Didyma is not directly affected. However, if the Aegis is weak or not present for some reason, then the demon can directly target Didyma with earthquakes, which interrupt all laboratory activities for the season (even in labs which did not collapse). In addition, all laboratories have a –3 penalty to Laboratory Activities until a season is spent (for each laboratory) tidying up. Identifying and locating Agamenoth is diffi</div>
<div>cult as he lives underground, and has little reason to surface, so the player characters will have to be very cunning to hunt him down or to even realize that he is present at all. The first hint may be the stench of sulfur among the ruined buildings which should be recognized as an infernal presence, but this may be misidentified as a casting sigil (unless investigated further with InVi magic). His many centuries slumbering mean that Agamenoth is not as well known as his rank of demon prince suggests. However, any character with an Infernal Lore Ability Score can check against an Ease Factor of 12 on Agamenoth’s Reputation (see ArM5, page 19). Mileta (Alexander’s familiar, herself once a demon) recognizes the stench of Agamenoth in the wreckage of the earthquakes, but is reluctant to reveal this directly, for fear of provoking questions about her origins. However, Mileta might suggest that Apollo is petitioned for information. If he meets her, Agamenoth likewise recognizes Mileta’s demonic past, and he has no compunction against using this knowledge to cause trouble for her. Ancient church records in Miletos also contain references to Agamenoth’s presence.</div>
<div>Didyma as a Background Covenant</div>
<div>If Didyma is used as an NPC covenant, then your characters may wish to (or be forced to) interact with Didyma in the following circumstances. Once at the covenant, visitors can be involved directly or indirectly in any of the Suggested Storylines, or stories can be told about the interaction between visitors and the covenant-characters.</div>
<div>• Some Theban magi, especially pagans, visit Didyma regularly to receive prophecies. • Pagan characters, including members of the league of the Children of Olympos, may visit the ancient temples for religious or Mystery Cult purposes. • Pious Christian characters may wish to destroy the pagan cult at Didyma. • The player characters may be allied to either Nestor or Aristocles the Wanderer, who are estranged members of the Branchidae family and seek to either control or destroy the covenant, respectively. • Didyma may seek help from the player characters to locate and slay the demon Agamenoth, or demon-hunting characters may learn of his presence some other way and travel to Didyma to slay him on their own initiative. • The Sacred Way is a source of faeries which could interest Merinita magi. • Didyma is a good base for magi hunting monsters in the region, and William and Herakles would be good, knowledgeable hunting companions. • Didyma, and the ports of Panormos and Miletos, are potential launching points for magi seeking to cross the Mediterranean, headed for North Africa. Crusading magi might also use Didyma as a staging point. • Quaesitor characters might investigate the extent of the mundane interference that entangles Didyma. • Theban Tribunal officials may travel to Didyma to meet and influence Nikola, who is a member of the Tribunal’s Council of Magistrates.</div>

<h1>Chapter Five</h1>


<div sidebars>
<div>Few visitors come to this mist-shrouded valley in Hibernia’s northern Ulaid province, but it is home to faeries who live deep underground in the dark, giants, and an isolated and insular covenant of magi. Deep in Winter, the covenant of Longmist is dominated by two elder magi, one living at the top of the tower in the light and air, and the other in the cellars and cisterns amid the dark and the earth. Its magi live life according to a strict rule describing the structure of their days, their conduct, and even their studies. Despite this, Longmist is a conflicted covenant, bereft of leadership, and destined to fall in on itself; reprieve from Winter seems unlikely. Perhaps there is another way. As the elders continue their descent into Twilight and infirmity, the younger magi of the covenant could chart a course between the extremes represented by their elders. But will they work together to govern by accord, or will they succumb to the same in-fighting that has blighted Longmist for the last two generations? Winter may be inescapable, but the magi have it within their power to weather the storm.</div>

<h3>History</h3>

<div>The Hibernian covenant of Longmist was founded in 927 in a mist-shrouded valley between Lough Beagh and Lough Inshagh in the province of Ulaid, and it spent its early days securing and defending its lands. The valley was already contested by both druids and a Bjornaer wolf and his followers. On their own, the magi of what was to become Longmist were no match for either. And so they sought allies in the Túatha Dé Danann of the otherworld. There is no record of the bargain struck with the people who live under the ground, but it is a relationship that persists today.</div>
<div>The Túatha Dé Danann helped the magi defeat the druids and then to defend their land against the Bjornaer magi for a year, long enough to form their covenant with the shield of Cú Chulainn as their cathach or trophy. Impressive courtyards were designed and built, and when eventually a new regio formed over the covenant, a new tower was raised within it. For the next seventy years, the magi of Longmist entertained magi, faeries, and nobles from across Ulaid, growing in wealth and reputation all the while. The covenant’s isolation started during the Schism War when the magi of Longmist withdrew to their inner tower. However, their old Bjornaer foes took advantage of the widespread conflict and raided the covenant, seeking Cú Chulainn’s shield. One magus and three apprentices were killed in the raid and the shield was taken. The Túatha Dé Danann armed their allies and the retaliation was swift, resulting in the death of Ualgrimm, the Bjornaer elder. The shield was shattered in the attempt to reclaim it, so at the urging of the Túatha Dé Danann,</div>
<div>the Bjornaer pelt was taken in its stead and this serves as the Cathach to this day. Longmist’s defense of its lands earned it respect, but the magi chose to continue their insular ways and live quietly apart, playing only a limited part in the politics of the Tribunal. Eventually, trade with other covenants dwindled, as did correspondence. Before long, the covenant closed its gates to all but its covenfolk and the occasional Redcap. Despite its isolation, Longmist never had trouble acquiring apprentices. Insular it may have been, but always respectful of Ireland’s druids. For a long time, when the druids found a Gifted child, they first came to Longmist to trade. The last century has seen foreign invaders, both mundane and Hermetic, come to Hibernia. Longmist broke its silence and called for these newcomers to be hounded out of the Tribunal.  These calls were ignored, resentment for which is still strong within the covenant.</div>

<h3>Boons and Hooks</h3>

<div>The covenant is described through the following Boons and Hooks: Aura (Major Boon): The mundane world contains only part of Longmist. The magi live and work in a tower that exists within a regio that sits atop the old covenant buildings, which have long been left to the covenfolk. Within this regio, which contains the main tower, the aura rises to six. An enchanted doorway provides a permanent route into the regio, so it is modeled here as an increased localized aura rather than by taking the Regio Boon. Magical Fortress (Major Boon): This is a tall tower raised from within the regio. The</div>
<div>Year Founded: 927 Season: Winter Symbol: A Wolf Pelt Cathach: The pelt of a Bjornaer Wolf</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>tower was conjured through ritual during Longmist’s long summer and is the work of a long-since dead Verditius specialist. Mystical Allies (Major Boon): Longmist’s name carries weight with the Fir Bolg of Ireland, with airy spirits of the land and sky, and with the non-Hermetic druids of Connacht. Aura x2 (Minor Boon): The covenant’s general aura is five. Seclusion (Minor Boon): Long before the Normans came to Ulaid, the people of that land learned not to interfere with the druids of the long mists, and so the covenant receives few visitors to the valley that shrouds it. Small Tower (Free Choice): The visible expanse of Longmist is a relatively small tower surrounded by walls. The walls offer some security but are not defensible against determined opposition. Divided Loyalty (Major Hook): The remaining covenfolk have loyalty to one of the two elder magi of Longmist. They hope to receive favor by supporting one over the</div>
<div>other. This extends to the younger magi too, and perceived allies of one elder magus may be treated with suspicion by servants of the other. Fractured Council (Major Hook): The council is in deadlock. The position of princeps is vacant and both of the elder magi desire it. The younger magi may be called upon to undertake tasks for these opposing masters and must chart a careful course between them. Contested Resource (Minor Hook): All Hibernian covenants must have a Cathach, or trophy, to prove their connection to Ireland and their worthiness to hold their lands. It must be kept outside the Aegis as a challenge to those who would test themselves against the covenant. In this case, Longmist’s Cathach is the pelt of a Bjornaer magus, ancestor to a covenant of Bjornaer wolves. The continued display of the pelt is an insult that has never been forgiven. Crumbling (Minor Hook): The covenant is poorly-maintained, with plaster</div>
<div>and mortar flaking from the walls, gates rusted shut, and doors and window shutters warped and ill-fitting. Deathbed Visitor (Minor Hook): The local Ulaidh people fear the cry of the banshee as it heralds a doom. There are few things that would drive the mundane to the walls of Longmist, but the ungodly wail foretelling death is one of them. The covenant itself is not immune from the banshee’s power and it may be heard circling the valley, portending the death of one of the covenfolk. If the magi can capture the banshee, however, they may be able to prevent the death. Dwindling Resource (Minor Hook): For years, the walls of Longmist have produced raw Vim vis. But the yield has recently been falling. Whether this is because the aura is generating less vis or the covenfolk have become less adept at finding it isn’t clear. This Hook applies to the From the Very Walls Themselves vis source as described later. From the start of play, the source loses 10% of its yield each year.</div>

<h3>Hibernia</h3>

<div>For much of its existence, Hibernia was paid little notice by the continent and its magi were received with slight regard. All that changed when the English crossed the sea and wrested control of Ireland from its High King. With this change in mundane politics, the Order looked again at Hibernia and found a land rich in Magical auras and vis. Over the last fifty years, magi from across the sea have come to Hibernia to claim land and form new covenants, something that has caused much concern to the elders of Hibernia, who fear that they will ultimately be displaced. The western province of Connacht had long ago been ceded to a loose organization of hedge wizards; under a centuries-old treaty no magus of the Order may spend more than three nights under a Connacht sky. This leaves a large part of Ireland that the Order cannot, under current treaties, exploit. Young magi spend a year or more between the end of their apprenticeship and their acceptance into the Order undertaking the macgnímartha (MOC-guh-nee-morhuh), or youthful exploits. As they sit outside the Order, all of Hibernia is open to them and this time is used to seek out adventure, find friends and allies, and challenge themselves against enemies and rivals. They do not yet have the Parma Magica, and so must get by on their wits. Each Hibernian covenant must have a cathach or trophy, and display it outside of</div>
<div>their Aegis of the Hearth. This is both a statement and a challenge; a statement as to the covenant’s fitness to rule their lands and a challenge to others to take it from them. Without their cathach, a covenant is not considered part of the Tribunal and its lands do not enjoy the protection of the code. And without a covenant, a magus is not resident and may not vote at Tribunal. For full details on Hibernia, see The Contested Isle.</div>
<div>The Elder Races of Ireland</div>
<div>Ireland has not always been populated by man. In years gone by Ireland has seen a number of “invasions”, each of which has seen power change hands and the incumbent peoples marginalized. The Fomórach (pronounced FUH-mowrakh, singular Fomóir, FUH-mowr) are the original peoples of Ireland. In their day they were powerful giants, and they fought with all the subsequent tribes who came to Ireland, eventually being defeated. Those who remain in the mortal realm now live in the kingdom of Tír Fhomóraig, an island off Ulaid’s northern coast. Fomóir characters are Magic Humans (Realms of Power: Magic, page 32) possessing the Giant Blood Virtue. All have obvious deformations, but no two fomórach are the same. They have been cursed that they may not set foot on Irish soil. The Fir Bolg were the first to divide the</div>
<div>land into the four provinces. Having been defeated by the Túatha Dé Danann, they were given their choice of province in which to live. The Fir Bolg chose Connacht and then withdrew from the rest of Ireland. They have since been forced even from Connacht, and most live on the Isles of Aran off Connacht’s west coast where they scrape a hard living in the wind-ravaged soil. The Fir Bolg are Magic Humans and were once tall, handsome, and mighty. While subject to the Fomórach, their blood mixed with that of the giants and only the Fir Bolg royal lines are now free from Fomórach deformities. The Túatha Dé Danann are the offspring of humans, bested by the Fomórach and driven from Ireland. They worshiped the continental Celtic faeries and from them learned of art, warfare, and magic. On their return to Ireland, they drove the Fir Bolg to the west and defeated the Fomórach, cursing them with baneful circumstances should they set foot on Irish soil again. The humans native to Ireland in 1220 are the Sons of Mil. Mil was a knight whose sons were prophesied to rule over Ireland. His armies, led by druids, eventually defeated the Túatha Dé Danann and drove them underground, out of the sunlight and into the night.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Faerie Court (Minor Hook): The kings and princes of the Túatha Dé Danann take an active interest in the magi of Longmist, especially Conchobor and those who support him. They provide service to Conchobor, including maintaining a watch over the Cathach, but they frequently ask for service in return. Superiors (Minor Hook): The younger magi have few rights over the covenant’s resources. Requests for access or use must be put before the council and an inquorate council or veto from an elder means that the resource may be withheld. Negotiation and service is often required.</div>

<h3>Magi</h3>

<div>The six magi of Longmist consist of two elder magi, both in excess of 100 years of age, and four younger magi, each no older than 35. The generation between these two has been lost, either to Twilight or death. Two of these younger magi were apprenticed to the two Elders and their loyalties still lie with them. The parentes of the other two younger magi are no longer at the covenant: one through Final Twilight and the other through mortal aging and death. The magi of Longmist live under a strict rule that enforces structure upon their days, curtails their conduct, and even guides their studies. However, the magi have differing views on this rule, with some eager to explore beyond the covenant or learn magic that might draw disapproval, while others feel a responsibility to uphold the rule.</div>

<h3>The Elder Magi</h3>

<div>The two elder magi living at Longmist have been designed as NPCs able to guide and direct the player characters.</div>
<div>Lugh-éccnaid of The Younger House</div>
<div>Lugh-éccnaid of The Younger House, or House Ex Miscellanea to those outside Hibernia, occupies the top-most levels of the tower and watches all that goes on within the covenant. He considers himself the rightful leader of Longmist. He had been a vocal opponent to the influx of continental magi over the last 50 years, but in time, as he lost the argument, he stopped attending Tribunals and ceased correspondence with many friends turned enemies. His concern comes from seeing Ireland’s future in its past. Just as with the Fir Bolg, the Túatha Dé Danann, and the druids, he sees a time when the native Order will be sidelined and their Peripheral Code replaced by one from the continent. He has written a number of polemic texts that stress the independence of his Ordo Hiberniae. His aim is to see Hibernia secede from the Order and determine its own Code. He calls for residency to be limited to those magi who can trace their presence in Hibernia at least three generations back. Those who cannot should be re</div>

<div>Resource    Build Points Enchanted Devices & Laboratories	 502 Library & Laboratory Texts  1089 Money & Wealth   30 Specialists & Teachers   286 Vis Sources & Stocks   278 Most of the covenant’s vis is in the form of stocks built up across the centuries rather than in a reliable yearly income.</div>

<h3>Past Magi</h3>

<div>Many magi have called Longmist home, but only six remain. So what happened to the others? Here are some notable magi, the years they were active at Longmist, and notes on their fates.</div>
<div>Magus   Years  Notes Niall of the Younger House 927 – 1011 Founder of Longmist, negotiated peace with thedruids. Fergus of Merinita 927 – 1014 Founder of Longmist, forged the alliance with the Túatha Dé Danann. Hannewalt on Bar 937 – 1049 First of the Tytalus lineage to join Longmist. He came from England and brought with him       magic and rituals for perceiving and crossing boundaries. Marcus Cordo of Flambeau	 967 – 1002 The only Flambeau to have joined Longmist, killed along with his apprentice during the       Bjornaer raid that claimed the shield of Cú Chulainn. Cearnach of Verditius 978 – 1064 Faerie-blooded smith who brought the Verditius lineage to Longmist. Wielded the blade      that took the Bjornaer pelt that now serves as the covenant’s Cathach. Retired to Verdi       on training an apprentice to continue the line. Astwick of Bonisagus 1027 – 1070 Suspected of sharing the covenant’s magical secrets with others. He was ultimately      forced from the covenant, but he took his written works and researches with him,       spending the rest of his days cloistered in Durenmar. While he trained an apprentice       during his years at Longmist, no remnant of his lineage remains. Faventinus of Verditius 1087 – 1164 Creator of the Bronze Man automaton that stands in the covenant courtyard. It was       once assumed that his magic died with him when he succumbed to Final Twilight. Calvacius of Tytalus 1125 – 1218 Parens to Mícheál Amhreaidh, he disappeared from the covenant two years ago.       Conchobor’s investigations showed that Calvacius had fallen into Final Twilight. Tadhg an Tuir of Verditius 1128 – 1218 Parens to the Cailleach, Tadhg died nearly two years ago after his Longevity Ritual      failed. He suffered an aging crisis from which no magic could pull him back. He is buied       at Qui Sonant Pro Quieto.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>moved. These texts have not been placed in the library and indeed none have yet been circulated to the Tribunal, though that may be about to change. As covenant Propraetor, he has final say over the covenant’s external relationships with mundanes, druids and hedge wizards, other covenants, and so on. He has used this influence to close down relations with magi and covenants taking a lenient view on the influx of foreign magi in the last 50 years, becoming a major contributor to the covenant’s continued isolation. Away from politics, his Corrguineach lineage (Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 109) means he is well-versed in the summoning of spirits, which he employs as his eyes, ears, and agents. He has a number of Aegis tokens that he uses for this purpose, granted to the spirits and retained in his sanctum. In addition, he is Longmist’s specialist in Corpus and the covenant’s crafter of Longevity Rituals, Laboratory Texts for which can be found in the library. A vain man, Lugh swathes himself in youthful illusion through an enchantment in his talisman. He has read in the Lebor Feasa Runda that those who drink of the well called Tobar Segais, on the plain of Mag Mell, on the island of Tir Na nÓg, ruled by the giant Fomórach, will live forever. His age hangs heavy upon him, and he may soon look to his filius to fetch him some of that water. He currently benefits from a +13 Longevity Ritual bonus, but he is aware that his age is outstripping his ability to hold nature at bay.</div>
<div>Conchobor Crosach of House Merinita</div>
<div>While Lugh lives at the top of the tower, Conchobor has his sanctum and laboratory beneath ground amid the cellars and the cisterns, and it has been many years since he has left the covenant. It is here that he holds council with Túatha Dé Danann princes and ambassadors, deep underground away from the light. Conchobor considers that these links to the Túatha Dé Danann make him Longmist’s natural leader. As with Lugh, Conchobor is an isolationist, but his concerns stop at the covenant gates; let Hibernia look to itself and let those who would assault Longmist look to their chances. He is allied with the Túatha Dé Danann and shares their enmity toward the Fir Bolg and the distorted giant Fomorach. He can be a demanding man and</div>
<div>deeply suspicious of the motives of his fellow magi. A Twilight episode stripped his Parma Magica’s power to protect him from the social effects of The Gift, meaning he quickly became suspicious and distrustful of magi and their kind. Conchobor is also the covenant’s Praefectus, which gives him nominal charge over the security of the covenant’s lands outside the Aegis of the Hearth. In recent years, he has been extending this influence to cover any resources originating outside the covenant, including its vis sources and stocks. His Nature Lore (Underworld) Virtue (as per Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 103) covers all the tunnels beneath Longmist and the extended valley, and all the creatures and faeries found within. He benefits from a +12 Longevity Ritual bonus.</div>
<div>The Younger Magi</div>
<div>There are four younger magi at Longmist. These are designed to be taken up as player characters and all are within a few years’ age from each other.</div>
<div>Cailleach Dhé Dherg of House Verditius</div>
<div>With her red hair, Cailleach Dhé Dherg is a striking presence in the covenant, though often admonished for going about with her hair uncovered. She is referred to as the Cailleach by magi and covenfolk alike. She is the only maga currently at Longmist, and in fact her apprenticeship there was the cause of much argument between the elder magi of the time. Her parens, Tadhg an Tuir, held firm against the Longmist council, despite their approaches to magi of House Bonisagus. She is fascinated by the bronze man standing in the covenant’s courtyard. It is the result of Verditius mysteries and she wants to learn how to repair and awaken it, something she anticipates will take her beyond the covenant walls; as her parens realized, Longmist has little future in isolation. The bronze man is close to being irreparable, so time is now of the essence and the outside world beckons. The Cailleach has spent the last two years investing time into both her laboratory and her new talisman. Her laboratory now has a great forge capable of withstanding magically-intense temperatures and she has refined it to suit her own way</div>
<div>of working. Lugh-éccnaid has seen her handiwork and is not impressed, believing that her design strays from that expected of a Longmist maga. The Cailleach spent some of her macgnímartha as a laboratory assistant to an itinerant magus of House Verditius called Peter, time she spent learning more of her House’s secrets ahead of her Initiations.</div>
<div>Dara Connachtach of The Younger House</div>
<div>The youngest of the magi and the most recently gauntleted, Dara is often treated as an inexperienced junior, despite being just three years younger than the Cailleach. Once apprenticed to Lugh, Dara is one of the Corrguineach (Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 109), and as such he summons, bargains with, and controls elemental spirits. He has also spent some time among the druids of Connacht and even the Fir Bolg.</div>

<h3>Designing Your Own Magi</h3>

<div>You could create your own magi instead of using the four younger magi described here, and there are specific story roles that could be filled:</div>
<div>The maga Cailleach Dhé Dherg provides an impetus to explore Longmist’s Verditius heritage and could be a focus for rebuilding the covenant’s magical assets. The magus Dara Connachtach provide a cultural link back to Connacht, providing reasons for either exploring that province outright or at least in reestablishing links to the hedge wizards and druids who live there. As a member of House Merinita, Eochaid Dubh provides an obvious link between the covenant and the faeries found across the valley and beyond. Mícheál Amhreaidh has a responsibility to the covenant. He represents covenant tradition as passed down through the generations. As such, he is an obvious future leader, one who may need to balance progress with tradition.</div>
<div>These places within the covenant’s story are independent of whether the individual magi want to maintain their seclusion or participate again within the Tribunal and they are independent of their view of the magi arriving from the continent. Magi with strong views on those subjects also enhance story potential at Longmist.</div>

He is usually wrapped in illusion however, in which case he appears healthy, robust, and energetic. He has a stern gaze but is otherwise pleasant enough. Casting Sigil: His spells and effects are preceded by a misty impression of the spell’s target, which grows from Lugh’s hands or magical device.

<div>Lugh-éccnaid’s Talisman</div>
<div>Lugh’s talisman is a slender staff of rowan wood that has developed a lustrous patina over nearly a century of use. An agate is affixed to the staff’s head, bound by strips of leather and resin. It has been opened to 20 pawns of vis so far, and 15 of those pawns have been spent on enchantments.</div>
<div>Perfect Circle ReHe 13 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Personal, D: Momentary, T: Individual The staff draws a geometrically-perfect standard-sized circle in the ground without the need for the magus to guide the staff,</div>
<div>particularly useful when concentrating on other spells or preparing to cast a Circle spell. Note that a magus must still trace the circle by hand to actually cast a Ring or Circle spell (ArM5, page 112). (Effect: Base 3; Modifications: +10 Unlimited Use)</div>

(Effect: Base 4, +1 Concentration; Modifications: +4 for 12/day, +5 device maintains concentration)</div>
<div>Attunements: Agate: +3 Air Agate: +5 Protection from Storms Staff: +2 Repel things Staff: +4 Control things at a distance Staff: +4 Destroy things at a distance</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>During his macgnímartha or “beardless years”, he took to traveling with a man called Brea, schooled in spirits. Against his advice, and at the prompting of bravado, Dara summoned a spirit that he could not then control. The spirit, angry and powerful, attacked the pair. While Dara ran and escaped the druid lost his life to the spirit. Dara has not told anyone within Longmist of this secret shame. He respects and fears his parens, and knows about the books that Lugh has written, but does not share Lugh’s view of the Order.</div>
<div>Eochaid Dubh of House Merinita</div>
<div>Once apprenticed to Conchobor, Eochaid is an accomplished illusionist, and he has so far eschewed the Merinita Mysteries in favor of improving his understanding of Imaginem. Uncertain how much further he has to travel on that path, he is now coming round to the idea of learning more about his Merinita heritage. Eochaid is easily led and has a weakness</div>
<div>for music and carousing. He is frequently forced to eat his meals separately from the other magi as punishment for joining the covenfolk in their carouse. He has no talisman or familiar, but he has enhanced his laboratory in preparation. He has gained the attention of a mundane magpie that frequently visits him while he works. Eochaid risks further punishment by bringing scraps of food to his chambers for the bird, but he considers the company to be worth it. He spent much of his macgnímartha as a drunkard, carousing his way around Hibernia. His drinking combined with the effect of The Gift upon his drinking partners placed him in harm’s way more than once. Although familiar with the Túatha Dé Danann, he does not trust their motives.</div>
<div>Mícheál Amhreaidh of House Tytalus</div>
<div>Mícheál is the covenant’s Censor, or master of rituals, and in a covenant that</div>
<div>strongly promotes communal spell-casting, Mícheál leads the communions. Unlike the other magi of Longmist, who are all nominally Christian, Mícheál has been taught a different path, one of veneration to the goddess Domnu. Rationally, he understands the power of the Dominion and understands that the entity he knows as Domnu is one of the primal Kosmokrators (Realms of Power: Magic, page 109) and as such subject to a greater power, but through years of tuition and study he accepts his faith in her power. He believes that the old magics of Ireland hold promise for the future and would like one day to see them integrated with Magic Theory, if not by his hand then perhaps under his sponsorship. His future talisman is a circlet of silver, into which are embedded numerous jewels and precious stones, a crown purportedly from the old times. It has been owned by generations of the covenant’s Censors, each disenchanting it before passing it to the next so that they may attune it as their own talisman. Mícheál views his wardship</div>

<div>of the crown as an honor and is keen to design his own effects one day to increase its growing lore. He spent his macgnímartha traveling between old pagan sites across Hibernia, and his devotion to the old religion is known across the Tribunal. A decisive moment happened during this time: he was found and set-upon by Longmist’s traditional enemies; a covenant of Bjornaer magi. Gravely wounded, he was eventually rescued by a Fir Bolg war band. He has held a deep antipathy for all Bjornaer magi since then. His role as Censor makes him responsible for ensuring that the other younger magi behave as expected.</div>

<h3>Notable Covenfolk</h3>

<div>Longmist has few covenfolk. Most are growing old without issue and slowly succumbing to Warping. Those who remain have split loyalties, and while they nominally function together, Longmist’s descent into winter means that little is done without explicit guidance from the magi.</div>

<h3>Companions</h3>

<div>Given the covenant’s isolation, there are only two companion characters currently associated with Longmist.</div>
<div>Bran in Gai Móir</div>
<div>Bran is the turb captain responsible for ensuring that the grogs carry out their duties. He is distrustful of Conchobor’s allies so naturally favors Lugh. He is married to Ailbhe, a woman eight years his junior, but they are childless. Bran blames the magi, suspecting that they have enchanted him in some way. As he is not yet</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Conchobor (Cont’d) Conchobor’s Talisman</h3>

<div>Conchobor enchanted a bronze glove, created for him by a smith of the Túatha Dé Danann. The bronze was smelted in fires fueled by exotic citrus woods from far across the seas and the glove was as supple as calf-leather. Before he took this wondrous item into his laboratory, however, he had Faventinus of Verditius carefully replace each rivet with one made of iron. He then opened the device for enchantment and with its first effect invested took it to the Túatha Dé Danann. He tried to use its new power to best his allies, to become their master, but he misjudged their power and their response was swift. They caused the glove to grow and to fuse with his flesh such that it now covers his left arm from shoulder to finger tip. The pain of that experience stays with him still as does the memory that the Túatha Dé Danann still hold a powerful Arcane Connection to him: a coin forged by Ruadan of the Túatha Dé Danann from Conchobor’s pain. The Arm of Conchobor has been opened with 20 pawns of vis and enchanted with the following effects, which use 13 pawns of space:</div>
<div>The Guiding Hand PeCo 30 Pen +22, 12/day R: Voice, D: Concentration, T: Individual Causes pain to people or creatures normally affected by Corpus effects, such as faeries that adopt human forms and identities. (Effect: Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration; Modifications: +11 for +22 Penetration, +4 for 12/day)</div>
<div>Bring the Light CrIg 19 Pen +0, 12/day R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Individual Like Lamp without Flame, Conchobor’s arm gives off a white light, illuminating an</div>
<div>area about ten paces across. Once triggered, the device maintains concentration. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration; Modifications: +4 for 12/day, +5 device maintains concentration)</div>
<div>Banish the Light PeIg 25 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Structure As the spell Well Without Light, all light is magically subdued in the target structure. Creo Ignem effects greater than level 20 can overcome this magical darkness. (Effect: Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +3 Structure; +5 device maintains concentration)</div>
<div>This Room is Mine to Command ReTe 30 Pen +0, unlimited use R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Room Allows Conchobor to remotely manipulate items in his environment as though he had Strength +5. Particularly fine control requires Finesse stress rolls against Ease Factors of 12 or more. (Effect: Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +2 Room; Modifications: +5 device maintains concentration, +10 unlimited use)</div>
<div>Attunements: Iron: +7 harm or repel faeries Glove: +4 affect things by touch Glove: +4 manipulation at a distance Bronze:	 +5 darkness</div>
<div>Conchobor’s Devices</div>
<div>Conchobor has created the following devices:</div>
<div>Cloak of the Túatha Dé Danann InVi 40 Pen +14, Unlimited Use R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Vision When wrapped around him, the cloak allows Conchobor to pass through faerie regiones as easily as the Túatha Dé Danann themselves do. The effect is triggered by proximity to the boundary, and the wearer can decide whether to step through or not. The effect must penetrate the Magic Resistance of its wearer in order to reveal the way through the boundary. As a result, Conchobor has to suspend his Parma Magica to use this device. (Effect: Base 3, +1 Touch, +4 Vision Target; Modifications: +3 triggered by proximity to the regio boundary, +10 unlimited use, +7 for +14 Penetrations)</div>
<div>Staff of Denial ReVi 30 Pen +16, 1/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Special This device is a staff made from dogwood, shod with lead, and with a chain of iron shackles secured at the top. When the staff is dragged in a line on any surface, no faerie with Might of 15 or less may cross that line. This warding effect is less powerful than a circular ward, but drawing the line requires no concentration and is usually sufficient to create a lesser ward across an opening or tunnel. It has been designed with a base effect of 4; we are using the base effect normally associated with a standard ward against Might 15 creatures and reworking it for different effect parameters. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Special Target; Modifications: +2 for 6/day, +8 for +16 Penetration)</div>

<div>Wand of the Cailleach</div>
<div>Cailleach’s talisman takes the form of a slender wand of gleaming steel. From afar, it appears to be a solid piece, but its construction is revealed close-up. It has a core of colored glass that runs its length and the wand was made in the manner of a rope twisted around this core. Here and there, the colored glass appears behind and through the steel, and it glows when magical power is used through it. The steel used in the wand was reforged from what was once a magical lamp created by one of her forebears at the covenant. Its current vis capacity is 10 with all of those pawns used. Cailleach’s Verditius Magic provides a +4 (equal to her Philosophiae Score and specialty) Shape and Material bonus to future enchantments.</div>
<div>Sense the Scale of Divine Power InVi 9 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Touch The wand constantly collects information on the prevailing aura surrounding it. Both the supernatural realm and the intensity of the aura is detected through four effects, each dedicated to a particular realm. The information gathered is not relayed directly to the item’s wielder but is used instead to trigger a further effect, described below, which avoids the danger of a constant source of Warping. (Effect: Base 2, +1 Touch Target, +2 Sun; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) Three other similar effects are also enchanted into the wand to detect Infernal, Magical, and Faerie auras.</div>
<div>Know the Power InVi 25 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Personal, D: Momentary, T: Individual This effect is triggered by the four Sense the Scale effects described above. Its sole purpose is to gather the information made available by those effects and make it available to subsequent effects that may then be subsequently triggered by this effect. (Effect: Base 3; Modifications: +12 linked triggers, +10 unlimited use)</div>
<div>The Power’s Light CrIg 22 Pen +0, Unlimited R: Personal, D: Concentration, T: Individual Triggered by the Know the Power effect described above, the glass within the wand glows with a pure white light when in the presence of the Dominion. The light increases in brightness with the magnitude of the aura such that the Cailleach, and those who understand the effect, are always aware of the aura and its strength. Information gained from the linked effects are as follows:</div>
<div>• The light glows white in the presence of a Dominion aura. • The light glows red in the presence of an Infernal aura. • The light glows blue in the presence of a Magical aura. • The light glows green in the presence of a Faerie aura.</div>

</div sidebars>

<div>subject to a Longevity Ritual, their childlessness is nothing to do with that particular enchantment. As loyal as he has been, his resentment is growing and he might soon confront them. When he does, the magi may feel the need to research fertility magic in order to help. He has been trained in the Clesa by Úathach of the Túatha Dé Danann. These supernatural feats of martial prowess have been used in Ireland since before the times of Cú Chulainn in the age of legend. More details on the Clesa can be found in The Contested Isle: The Hibernian Tribunal.</div>
<div>Éamonn Cruittire</div>
<div>Éamonn Cruittire mac Aindileas Uí hEódhasa comes from the line of Baile Uí Eódhasa, magical Ulaidh bards, or filídh. Like his forefathers, he has the power to enchant others through his storytelling, a power that has been passed from father to son. He has spent many years memorizing stories, mostly of ancient battles, feuds,</div>
<div>and conflicts, and taking them to the people of Ulaid. Éamonn’s family have long been associated with Longmist, an association he values highly, but while he finds Conchobor unsettling, he distrusts Lugh far more. The young bard views the magi with some confusion and condescension; he is unable to understand their adherence to their staid way of life, and scornful of their dismissal of music in their tower. Still, he has great affection for the remaining villagers who serve Longmist, and he is happy to continue his association while they remain. In addition, he enjoys the influence he has over his friend Eochaid.</div>

<h3>Teachers</h3>

<div>There are two covenfolk particularly useful as teachers or trainers. These are the monk Columb Brathair and the blacksmith Cathal Gobha. They cost 183 Build Points between them.</div>
<div>Columb Brathair, The Penitent Monk</div>
<div>A fallen priest, Columb’s diabolic excesses were finally discovered by Calvacius and Tadhg an Tuir of Longmist. He threw himself on their mercy and, for reasons that remain unclear, the magi stayed their hand and brought him back to the covenant where he now acts as priest and confessor. He is 70 years old, though he appears 65, with the protection of a Longevity Ritual with a –4 bonus. He has Communication of +1, Teaching (Infernal Lore) of 6, and both Infernal and Dominion Lore of 8. He costs 15 Build Points. The library contains a Laboratory Text for his Longevity Ritual. As described below, a further 108 Build Points were spent to outfit his chapel.</div>
<div>Cathal Gobha, the Blacksmith</div>
<div>Cathal is 40 years old and has been under the protection of a Longevity Ritual for the last five years. Warping has made him Offensive to Animals, so he tends to leave</div>

These count as medium props and give a +3 bonus to spells cast ceremonially. Given their size, Mícheál can carry props for three spells in his satchel, and he must choose before venturing out. If he has a packhorse, which the covenant currently lacks, he can take props for each of his spells.Encumbrance: 0 (0) Appearance: Always frowning, either in disapproval or in deep thought. His thinning hair is kept short and his</div>
<div>robes, over which he wears a white tabard, are always clean and free from wrinkle or blemish. Beneath his robes, he carries the scars of many bites and gashes inflicted upon him by the Bjornaer rogues who assaulted him. Casting Sigil: The target tremors slightly through the duration of the casting, which causes it to shed a light mist, like shaking stonework sheds dust. Voting Sigil: A small disk of gold with the impression of a crown punched into it.

<div>any farrier work to his son for fear of spooking the horses. Unfortunately, consistent with the sense of lethargy across the covenant, Cathal’s forge is rarely active. He has Communication of 1, Teaching (Blacksmith) of 6, and a Craft: Blacksmith of 8. He costs 15 Build Points. The library contains a Laboratory Text for his Longevity Ritual. His workshop costs 45 Build Points as it has been enhanced to provide an Innovation Score of +3 and a Raw Materials Score of +2, both of which are added to the craftsman’s Workshop Total as described in City & Guild, page 65. This allows him to create Superior quality goods. His son (Cináed mac Cathail) is his only apprentice. See below for more details on Cináed.</div>

<h3>Specialists</h3>

<div>Although they are not suitable as teachers, the covenant nonetheless has a number of significant specialists costing 103 Build Points.</div>
<div>Úna, the Herbwife</div>
<div>Úna is the covenant’s wise woman, knowledgeable about ailments and the herbs that cure them. She is 40 years old and has refused magical intervention in her aging, considering that her own knowledge of herbal compounds is sufficient to maintain her health and well-being. With an Intelligence of +1 and a Profession: Herbalist score of 7, she costs 7 Build Points. She also has a Chirurgy score of 5 and is frequently</div>

<h3>Partholon’s Crown</h3>

<div>The crown is a circlet of silver and has the following gemstones embedded into it:</div>
<div>Diamond; Ruby; Sapphire; Topaz</div>
<div>It has been disenchanted and is now ready to be opened for enchantment, but this requires a minimum of 20 pawns of vis and a Magic Theory score of 10. After passing through the possession of generations of magi, there are a number of laboratory texts that describe effects that can be enchanted into the crown, but these must be added before the device is attuned as a talisman if Mícheál is to take advantage of them. Alternatively, Mícheál could break with tradition and create his own talisman, although such a course of action would be met with disapproval by the elder magi.</div>

<h3>Bran in Gai Móir</h3>

<div>tion Lore: Covenant of Longmist 3 (politics), Organization Lore: Order of Hermes 2 (history), Ride 5 (battle), Single Weapon 5 (sparra), Survival 1 (peat bogs), Swim 1 (diving) Equipment: Round shield, full chain mail**, horse Encumbrance: 4 (4) Appearance: Bran is a tall man, longlimbed and standing a head taller than most of the grogs he leads.</div>
<div>** His arms and armor have been handed down from prior generations and have been altered to fit him. If using the rules for damaged goods from City & Guild, the armor has just one Damage Level left. He wants new equipment for himself and his men. Use the prices listed in City & Guild, page 144 to help decide how the magi treat his requests.</div>
<div>Faeborchless, or the Dancing Shield Feat</div>
<div>Faeborchless is a Cles learned from Úathach, a faerie resident at the Hibernian covenant of Leth Cuinn. This gives Bran the power to throw his shield or weapon in such a way that he can defend a number of characters equal to his Single or Great Weapon Ability, as appropriate. He must make a Dexterity + Single/ Great Weapon feat check against an Ease Factor of 9. If successful, the characters are defended and his shield or weapons return to his hands. If the roll fails, he must retrieve his weapons, which could potentially leave him defenseless.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>called upon by the villagers to tend minor knocks and scrapes. Although married to the farmer Cormac, she has been cuckolding him with Fearghal (see below) for some years. This affair is not widely known.</div>
<div>Íomhar, the Librarian</div>
<div>Íomhar has just turned 36 and with the passing of old Thomas he is now the covenant’s librarian. He has an Intelligence of 0 and a Profession: Librarian of 7, and he costs 7 Build Points. While far from stupid, Íomhar is frustrated that he lacks the academic rigor of his predecessors in his role. If there were some way in which he could</div>
<div>improve himself he would grasp the opportunity with both hands.</div>
<div>Maghnus, the Scribe</div>
<div>Although a capable scribe, the 39-year old Maghnus is slovenly by nature and this is evident in his own appearance and that of his workshop. He is particularly skillful with languages, however, and is able to read, write, and speak Latin, Greek, Gaelic, French, and German with similar fluency. With a Dexterity of +1 and a Profession: Scribe of 7, he costs 7 Build Points.</div>
<div>Piaras, The Percamenarius</div>
<div>Piaras is a morose man and has little desire for company. However, the vellum he produces is of the highest quality and other covenants have sometimes called upon his services. Piaras has written four instructional manuals for use in the preparation of certain types of vellum; one each for the skins of cows, sheep, goats, and a further text for the treatment of the skins of magical beasts. As per City & Guild, page 73, each of these adds +3 to the Craft Totals of other makers of parchment (Piaras cannot benefit from his own writing). Written in the vernacular, this collection costs 12 Build Points. Aged 56, though appearing 50, he enjoys a –4 aging bonus granted by his Longevity Ritual. He has a Dexterity of +3 and a Craft: Parchment (uterine vellum) of 9. As a specialist, he costs 9 Build Points, and these are added to 45 Build Points for his workshop, which he has enhanced with both a +2 Innovation Score and +3 Raw Materials. The library contains a Laboratory Text for his Longevity Ritual. His skin has become Disfigured by warping. It has the appearance of thin and white parchment, and the pulsing of his veins and the rushing of his blood can be seen beneath. This probably accounts for how withdrawn he has been in recent years. His equally morose, but increasingly jealous and impatient, assistant Maol Phóil has a Craft: Parchment score of 5, which costs 5 Build Points.</div>
<div>Cináed mac Cathail, Apprentice Blacksmith</div>
<div>Destined to take over from his father in the covenant’s forge when the time comes, Cináed has no interest in becoming a blacksmith. He would much rather become a grog and defend Longmist from its enemies. In particular, he has no love for the English and hopes Longmist will one day side against them. He has a Dexterity of +3, a score of 4 in Craft: Blacksmith, and costs 4 Build Points.</div>
<div>Fearghal, the Animal Handler</div>
<div>Longmist once maintained notable kennels and stables and, in the days when the covenant would host kings and princes in the hunt, there was a dedicated team of animal handlers. Fearghal is the last of these and he has little to do with his time except</div>

<h3>Longmist Grog</h3>

<div>round shield, sparra, short spear, two throwing axes, eating knife, warm cloak, and light camping gear. **	 As with their captain, their armor has one Damage Level remaining after being patched up as best can be. Encumbrance: 1 (3) Appearance: Dirty, with thick woolen clothing against the cold mists of the valley. Their oiled leather shoes still let in the damp, so they are often to be seen wrapped in their cloaks drying their shoes by the fireside. They look more rough than imposing; brigands rather than toll collectors. The Longmist grogs lack leadership capability in themselves, which means that while they have trained together, they fight as an untrained group unless their captain is there to lead them. They are loyal to the covenant, more through habit than desire, but they are also lazy, and while they may often complain about how much work they are told to do, they are rarely pushed.</div>
<div>New Flaw: Poor Living Conditions</div>
<div>Minor, General Either because of this character’s own poor living conditions or those of people he is in frequent contact with, he is more susceptible to the rigors of daily life. The character has an additional –1 Living Conditions Modifier. This is cumulative with the character’s base Living Conditions Modifier as per ArM5, page 170. In the case of the Longmist grogs, their poor living conditions arises from days spent away from the covenant, living off the land and exposed to the elements.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>tend to the rare visiting horse, advise farmers on the ailments of their livestock, and look after the covenant’s bees. Aged 36, he frequently commits adultery with Úna the Herbalist. With no wife of his own and seemingly no prospect of one, it is a sin for which he is willing to forgive himself. He has a Dexterity of +2, an Animal Handling score of 7, and costs 7 Build Points.</div>

<h3>Servants</h3>

<div>There are twelve servants in all and none live within the tower in the regio, instead living in the small village surrounding the old tower in the mundane world. There are eight women and four men. The women tend to the chores around the tower and work the kitchens, while the men are little more than laborers, usually working under the direction of the specialists described above. The covenant also employs four laborers and four teamsters who are responsible for general lifting, carrying, and other chores, and securing provisions for the covenant.</div>

<h3>Grogs</h3>

<div>The covenant has a small turb of six grogs, captained by Bran in Gai Móir. For the most part, the grogs spend their days on the toll-bridge that forms an important part of the covenant’s income, escorting supply runs to market, and occasionally standing guard at the covenant itself. There is rarely any bother on the mundane front, but they are called upon now and then to dissuade hungry giants who wander into Longmist’s shrouded valley. At the start of 1220, the grogs fight as a trained group (ArM5, page 173) and their preferred weapons are spear and sparra.</div>

<h3>Covenant Organization</h3>

<div>The magi live apart from their covenfolk in a tall tower hidden in a regio. For their part, the covenfolk retire to their small village each night and leave the magi to their strange business.</div>

<h3>Hierarchy and Governance</h3>

<div>While age itself does not grant additional power at council, magi who have trained an apprentice are treated as elders and are afforded more respect than those who have not. A council may be called at any time, and for a council to be quorate all magi currently in residence must attend or face censure. Exceptions may be granted where a proxy has been appointed, or a magus is in Twilight, for instance. Decisions at council are only binding where that session is quorate. Each magus has one vote at council, which may be used on each matter brought before it. Crucially, in return for their assistance throughout the life of the covenant, the Túatha Dé Danann have a seat and vote at council, although they do not count for the quorum however much Conchobor might argue in their favor. Because all magi must attend for the council to be quorate, and only a quorate council can censure an absent magus, a magus could paralyze the council by refusing to come out of his laboratory. In addition, the charter provides for the following roles: Princeps: This role is vacant, having been held by Tadhg an Tuir of Verditius before his loss. Castellanus: This vacant role concerns the mundane and magical security of the covenant within the Aegis of the Hearth. Cancellarius: Responsible for the financial and magical well-being of the covenant. This includes accounting for vis and its expenditure on things such as Longevity Rituals. This role has been vacant for many years. Praefectus: This role is currently held by Conchobor and concerns the mundane and magical security of the covenant’s lands and property beyond the Aegis of the Hearth, which includes the cathach. Aedilis: Responsible for planning the covenant’s magical works. This role has been vacant for many years. Censor: Responsible for leading magical rituals and ceremonies and charged with maintaining the moral standards of the magi in the execution of their duties. Currently held by Mícheál. Propraetor: Responsible for maintaining relations with outside covenants, nobles, the Church, and so on. This role is cur</div>

<div>rently held by Lugh. Magi holding one of these roles gains an additional vote at council upon matters pertaining to their responsibilities. A quorate council must be convened to elect a magus to one of these roles. The candidate(s) may not themselves vote, and the matter is treated as falling within the responsibility of each of the roles described above, allowing holders to cast a second vote.</div>

<h3>Life at Longmist</h3>

<div>The magi of Longmist live an almost ascetic life governed by set events in the day, agreed forms of study, manner of dress, and a uniformity of magical style to such an extent that even their casting sigils become aligned. None have challenged this way of life for many years.</div>
<div>Consensus and Community</div>
<div>All Longmist magi share certain qualities, certain common and agreed ways of doing things for which magi in other covenants might incline toward allowing or encouraging personal choice. The magi of Longmist adhere to these things through a sense of community, accepting that for all their differences their traditions hold them together and make them strong. Parma Magica: While the invocation of the Parma Magica is the same as for every other magus trained in the Order, each Longmist apprentice learns an almost reverential ritual of words and actions recited before invoking the Parma Magica. This involves two fingers on each hand being touched to brow, eyes, ears, nose, and lips in sequence while the magus recites a list of notable magi from Longmist’s past along with attributions of their particular strengths. The ritual is performed standing, with eyes closed and head bowed, and with the utterances respectfully quiet. The ritual seems to have no effect upon the Parma Magica or its invocation. The additional ritualistic elements take 30 seconds to perform. Voting Sigils: Longmist magi have their voting sigils made by the covenant’s blacksmith. This means that they are always metal, although the individual apprentice has some discretion as to the type, and their quality is dependent upon the mastery of the particular smith involved. Magical Sigils: While each magus’ magic manifests differently, those who have their</div>
<div>Gift opened at Longmist share a common element to their casting sigils: light mist accompanies each spell or effect, and this dissipates in line with the normal fading of magical residues. For different magi the mist may associate with the caster, the target, or may be a visual manifestation of the spell itself. Sanctum Markers: Each magus has their own sanctum, which of course includes his laboratories. The elder magi, however, must be added to the sanctum markers of the younger magi. Refusal to do so is a sign of dangerous non-conformity and the younger magus opens himself to censure. Laboratory Texts: All of Longmist’s magi use the same code and script for their laboratory texts.</div>
<div>The Offices of Longmist</div>
<div>The passage of each day is marked by the tolling of a cracked and tuneless bell housed in the small tower adjacent to the main tower of Longmist. This bell tells the magi when to rise, when to sleep, when to study, and when to congregate for their communal meals. Congregations in the hall, including meal times, are usually accompanied by a reading from books upon Magic Theory, the Arts, other Arcane knowledge, or the Vitae Magnae. This last, the Vitae Magnae, is a peculiarly Hibernian practice. These are books that describe their subject through chronicling the lives of famous magi. Most often, these are books on Area Lore: Hibernia, Code of Hermes, or Organization Lore: Order of Hermes, but other topics, including the Arts and Arcane Abilities are often found. All magi of Longmist, no matter what their rank or status, follow the same schedule. They consider this discipline to have seen the covenant through its long history and they view the ways of outsiders as lacking in moral fortitude. Visiting magi are advised of the schedule and expected to observe its times, especially meal times and the renewal of Parma Magica at dawn and dusk. Magi with a pious bent must fit their religious observances into their day as best they can. Magi brought up at Longmist are accustomed to the frequent interruptions throughout their days and they suffer no distraction as a result. Visitors undertaking study at the covenant treat this as a four-day distraction across the season, reducing by one for each season spent at the covenant.</div>
<div>Manner of Dress</div>
<div>Magi are required to dress respectfully at all times. In practice, this means wearing a simple woolen robe, belted at the middle, and a hood, worn down during study and at mealtimes, and up at all other times. Charms, rings, and other amulets as befits a magus are permitted. Ornamentation is not. Arms and armor, unless they form a talisman, are not permitted, as such things are for covenfolk, companions, and other grogs. Magi must wear their hair short and shaved at the back and sides. Women, as appropriate for their sex, are exempt from this, but must ensure that their hair is covered when in public.</div>
<div>Music at the Covenant</div>
<div>No music or singing is permitted within the tower of Longmist, as such things are for grogs and servants. This rule has been in force for over a century and while some may assume this to be a simple measure of austerity, keen-eyed apprentices may find a story about a faerie princess who once entranced the whole covenant through the loveliness of her voice. Music can sometimes be heard in the tower, however, as it drifts in from the small village at the tower’s base.</div>
<div>Meal Times</div>
<div>Magi and those of standing eat together in the hall. It is the rule of the covenant that all magi, when resident at Longmist, take their meals together. The bell is tolled and the magi must attend. Refusal or failure to do so may be punished. Meals are taken in silence, for these times are for nourishment and not for council, with the exception of a reading from a text upon the matter of magic, the Order, or the realms, given by one of the magi. The reading is usually in Latin, although this is dependent upon the text. This duty falls in strict rotation, and magi of all rank and status are included and must obey the rule. Three meals are served: midmorning, two hours before dusk, and three hours after dusk. Food between these mealtimes is not permitted.</div>
<div>Dawn and Dusk</div>
<div>As both dawn and dusk approach, the bell is rung as a signal for the magi to each attend to their Parma Magica. Each magus conducts the ritual, typically removing themselves to somewhere private when mundane or supernatural visitors are present.</div>
<div>Working Schedules and Experimentation</div>
<div>Magi are expected to improve their Arts and learn new spells, but this is to be done within strict hours, and a magus shall not work beyond these times without consent from the council. In game terms, where the magus would like to make use of a nonstandard laboratory routine, as described in Covenants, page 107, the magus must first approach the council and explain his need. Similarly, experimentation is frowned upon at Longmist for its dangers and the propensity to lead to lax and lazy habits. A magus must bring all requests to experiment before the council. Of course, this is the rule. However, magi may choose either to conduct themselves other than in accordance with the rule, or even go against the covenant’s explicit instructions. In theory, it is for the covenant Censor, currently Michael, to monitor the behavior of the magi.</div>
<div>Punishment</div>
<div>Magi are expected to obey. Where a magus falls short of the covenant’s moral and behavioral standards they are punished. Such punishments include:</div>
<div>• Private admonishing • The withholding of a meal • Exclusion from a common gathering • The suspension of all communication with the magus • Ten days of duty to the covenant</div>
<div>The covenant records indicate that public certamen has been used as a punishment at Longmist in the past, with a senior magus engaging the wayward magus. It is believed that in such cases the covenant appointed vis to the senior magus to be used in the punishment. No records exist of the wayward magus having won such a contest so the precedent is unclear, but it would appear that either outcome is considered equally binding.</div>
<div>Visitors and Aegis Tokens</div>
<div>Apart from any presented by the magi themselves, twenty-eight tokens, in the form of simple iron medallions engraved with a wolf’s head, are included in the Aegis of the Hearth ritual each year. These same tokens</div>
<div>have been used for generations and have passed through the hands of countless magi. There were more, but some have been lost and the old covenant stories suggest that others were stolen, along with several books, by visitors from Normandy many years ago. Magi and other visitors are each given a casting token for use during their visit when the covenant rises and performs the Parma Magica and they retain it until the covenant repeats the Parma Magica at dusk, at which point it must be returned to the covenant. This means that  a visitor has no token during the night and must suffer the full weight of the covenant’s Aegis during this time. It is important to note that supernatural visitors are granted tokens too, as are mundane visitors, and there is a strict hierarchy as to who receives a token in the unlikely event of there being more visitors than tokens. This hierarchy is as follows:</div>
<div>• A Magus of the Order • A Familiar of the Order • A Beast of Ireland • A Mundane Lord • A Hedge Wizard or Druid • An Apprentice • A Mortal Man of Ireland • A Foreigner</div>
<div>The tokens are kept in a small wooden box in the main hall for easy access should they be needed.</div>

<h3>Covenant Site</h3>

<div>Typical of many covenants, Longmist has a central building as its focus and a small village housing the covenfolk nearby. But it also has a regio at the heart of the covenant that hides the main tower from the mortal world around it.</div>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<div>Longmist was built in a mist-shrouded valley between Lough Beagh and the smaller Lough Inshagh in Donegal in the province of Ulaid in Hibernia. The weather-ravaged hillsides surrounding the covenant support few trees, but there is some woodland by the shores of the nearby lakes. Winters are generally mild but wet, and summers pleasantly warm, though midges and other biting</div>

<h3>The Offices of Longmist</h3>

<div>All magi of Longmist, no matter their rank or status, follow the same schedule. They consider this discipline to have seen the covenant through its three centuries and they view the ways of outsiders as lacking moral fortitude. Visiting magi are advised of the schedule and expected to observe it. Magi with a religious bent must fit their Christian observances into their day as best they can. Some of the times shown below are dependent on dawn and dusk.</div>
<div>02:00  Rise 02:15  A reading from the Vitae Magnae, followed by a nap 05:00  Breakfast, accompanied by a reading. Aegis tokens    are returned to visitors Dawn  Perform the Parma Magica 07:00  Study, laboratory work, or undertakings on behalf of    the covenant 15:00  Dinner, accompanied by a reading Dusk  Perform the Parma 	 Magica. Aegis tokens are collected    from visitors 19:00  Supper, accompanied by a reading 20:00  Retirement</div>
<div>Each event through the day is announced by the tolling of a once-magical bell, now rung by one of the covenfolk. Should magi undertake a rare excursion beyond Longmist, they attempt to abide by the offices unless doing so is likely to cause problems either for them, their hosts, or their companions. Accompanying grogs are so well versed in the offices that they help their masters by keeping track as best they can.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>insects are an annoyance. Longmist’s valley is typically obscured by a low-lying unnatural mist. In its early days, the covenant developed devices and spells to clear the mist, or to control it at will, allowing visitors a clear path. These have now either been lost or broken, and in any case the magi currently have no intention of making things easier for visitors. Buying supplies from nearby villages typically takes a long day’s round trip. The valley has a Magic aura of 2 and this rises to 5 at the covenant site. A level 6 regio sits over the central part of the covenant.</div>
<div>Main Structures</div>
<div>The main structure is a set of two intersecting oval courtyards with a four-story tower at their center. The outer walls were once plastered and whitewashed but these are now cracked, dirty, and flaking. The larger of the two courtyards has two large gates of iron latticework that once made for an impressive entrance. These have long been rusted shut and the two magical statues of warrior women that once hauled the gates open and shut have seized with them. The paved yard has a large fountain at its center, though the device that created the water has also failed. Alongside the fountain is a bronze man. Larger than a natural man and understood to represent the Fir Bolg in their glory days, this apparent statue is dressed as a blacksmith and he stands looking out to the gates. Some say he has a wistful look upon his face. The courtyard is overgrown and the paving stones have risen, uneven with the roots and small plants that grow up between them. It is no longer the grand entrance and all manner of broken carts, barrels, crates, and sacks find themselves stored here under the numerous wooden sheds and shelters built against the walls. A smaller courtyard at the rear of the tower, enclosed by a smaller wall, is now the functional entrance to the covenant. It was once used only by the covenant staff but since the failure of the magical gates, all visitors to the covenant must come through the humble wooden gates to this courtyard, which is littered with water troughs, chicken runs, and other signs of a working covenant. This is also where the stables and both Piaras and Cathal have their workshops. These courtyards have plenty of space should the magi wish to build additional structures within the walls.</div>
<div>The Lesser Tower</div>
<div>The smaller white stone tower is that which is visible in the mortal world. It has four levels above ground and a further level of cellars below. The front entrance is to the second level, up a set of steps from the grand courtyard. The rear entrance is to the first level through the kitchens. This tower once provided laboratories for the early inhabitants, but it is now used by the covenfolk as workspace and as a guardhouse by the grogs. An enchanted door connects this tower to its larger counterpart hidden in the regio. A bell is mounted in a small wooden bell tower on top of the stone structure.</div>
<div>The Greater Tower</div>
<div>Hidden within the level 6 regio, the heart of the covenant is a thirteen-story tower that extends both upwards and down into a series of cellars. The two elder magi live at opposite ends of the tower, one in the perpetual darkness and the other in the sky. The other magi each occupy a level, with several left empty, given the loss of magi. A large hall occupies one level and the library the level above that. Magi looking out of their laboratories see the valley extending away below them. Every level of the tower appears to rise above the mists allowing occasional glimpses of the mundane covenant below, and the sounds of the mundane level can sometimes be heard. The tower, however, is almost always invisible and inaudible from the mundane level. The strength of this regio dropped to 6 nearly thirty years ago, something that some attributed to the strengthening ties to the Túatha Dé Danann, others to the arrival of the Cailleach, and others to unsanctioned magical experiments.</div>

<h3>Laboratories</h3>

<div>Each magus has his own laboratory, and these are detailed below. There are also three extra laboratories once owned by former members of Longmist. A total of 360 Build Points have been spent on laboratories and their upkeep costs 44 ½ Mythic Pounds per year.</div>
<div>Lugh-éccnaid’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Lugh-éccnaid’s laboratory occupies the upper-most levels of the hidden tower of Longmist, having been expanded in the past so that it spans two floors. Much of the work is done on the lower level where a great cauldron has been installed, but the gallery formed from the upper level provides areas for contemplation, writing, and space for Lugh’s personal library and stores. This laboratory is highly specialized toward the development of Longevity Rituals. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: None Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +5, General Quality +3, Upkeep +8 (36 Mythic Pounds per year), Safety +8, Warping +0, Health +1, Aesthetics +7 Virtues & Flaws: Greater Feature (Cauldron), Highly Organized, Priceless Ingredients, Spotless, Spacious, Gallery, Elevated, Greater Expansion; Greater Focus (Cauldron) Specializations: Longevity Rituals +11, Teaching +1; Creo +1; Auram +1 Features: Cauldron These enhancements cost 60 Build Points.</div>
<div>Conchobor’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Deep beneath the covenant, seemingly more accessible to the Túatha Dé Danann and the creeping faeries of the earth than the covenfolk, Conchobor’s laboratory is a cold and dark place. The main chamber is spacious and is a thing of rocky steps and</div>

<h3>The Warrior Women</h3>

<div>The main covenant gates, though now seized shut, were once opened and closed on command by two magical bronzes each in the form of a heroic warrior woman. They are larger than a man and of an athletic build. Their hair is long and plaited, and appears to be banded by a circlet of bronze. Each wears a coat of plates and has a small sparra hanging from her belt. They are posed as though heaving upon chains that run through their hands to pull open the gates. Following the bronze man’s gaze from where he stands in the courtyard, it is clear that he is looking toward one of the two warrior women rather than at the gates themselves. What story, now unmoving, has been captured in the courtyard? Can the Cailleach free the blacksmith and see it finally play out?</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>platforms surrounding a slowly-rotating orb of granite magically suspended over a pool of still and clear water. Conchobor makes no claims as to the orb’s power, but those who have seen it have glimpsed the world beyond Longmist reflected in its polished surface. While the laboratory is within the Aegis of the Hearth, there is a gateway to the otherworld of the Túatha Dé Danann nearby, a magical path that allows pixies, brownies, and others of the fair folk to penetrate the laboratory. Most are content to watch and listen, but some provide occasional assistance, whether requested or not. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: None Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +6, General Quality +1, Upkeep +0 (1 Mythic Pound per year), Safety +4, Warping +2, Health –1, Aesthetics +3 Virtues & Flaws: Spacious, Faerie Ingredients, Greater Feature (Orb), Lesser Feature (Pool); Gateway, Subterranean, Gremlins Specializations: Experimentation +2, Binding Familiar +1; Intellego +4, Rego +1; Terram +2 These enhancements cost 50 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Cailleach’s Laboratory</div>
<div>A forge dominates the Cailleach’s laboratory and the external walls have are punctured by iron hollows and chimneys through which air is pulled and smoke expelled. The sound of the bellows reverberates as the fires reach magically high temperatures: perfect for forging and welding raw magic to devices. Her superior tools are made and maintained by Cathal Gobha and so do not increase the Upkeep cost of this laboratory. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Conchobor Crosach, Lugh-éccnaid Characteristics: Size +0 (–2), Refinement +2, General Quality –1, Upkeep +0 (1 Mythic Pound per year), Safety +3, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics +2 Virtues & Flaws: Greater Feature (Forge), Highly Organized, Superior Tools; Greater Focus (Forge) Specializations: Enchanting Items +8 These enhancements cost 20 Build Points.</div>
<div>Dara’s Laboratory</div>
<div>This laboratory is dominated by the summoning circle built into a raised circular dais in the center of the chamber. The laboratory equipment lines the walls and Dara has made efficient use of his space. However, the laboratory, or something</div>
<div>in it, appears to be haunted. Dara has not seen anything, and his magic has not yet detected a rogue presence, but he is certain that his equipment and notes are interfered with while his back is turned. Given his Dark Secret, Dara is particularly fearful of what the presence may in fact be. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Conchobor Crosach, Lugh-éccnaid Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +0, General Quality –2, Upkeep +0 (1 Mythic Pound per year), Safety +0, Warping +1 Health +0, Aesthetics +1 Virtues & Flaws: Greater Feature (Summoning Circle); Greater Focus (Summoning Circle), Haunted Specializations: Inventing Spells +5; Rego +2; Mentem +2 These enhancements cost 20 Build Points.</div>
<div>Eochaid’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Unlike the other laboratories and chambers within Longmist, this room is stark brilliant white. The walls have been plastered smooth and then painted with the most unnatural white that the covenant could acquire. The curved outer tower wall has a large round window that reaches almost floor to ceiling. The images visible through this window are reflected onto a series of hand-sized mirrors mounted against the inner wall, each at a slightly different angle or depth. The whole room is highly illuminated by scores of candles and Eochaid has promised to find a cheaper solution to lighting his sanctum. All the equipment must be kept away from the walls for fear of blemishing their purity, so the laboratory may seem a little awkward to some. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Conchobor Crosach, Lugh-éccnaid Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +1, General Quality –1, Upkeep +2 (3 Mythic Pounds per year), Safety –1, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics +2 Virtues & Flaws: Greater Feature (Mirror), Lesser Feature (Window), Excessive Lighting, Highly Organized; Greater Focus (Mirror), Awkward Shape Specializations: Imaginem +10 These enhancements cost 40 Build Points.</div>
<div>Mícheál’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Mícheál has spent a year enhancing his laboratory, refining it across two seasons and then creating an Auspicious Shape by turning</div>
<div>his chambers into a pentagon, and further by engraving a Summoning Circle into the floor. He has plans to extend his laboratory further to add both an Antechamber and a Balcony. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: Conchobor Crosach, Lugh-éccnaid Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +2, General Quality +1, Upkeep +0 (1 Mythic Pound per year), Safety +2, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics +2 Virtues & Flaws: Auspicious Shape, Highly Organized, Lesser Feature (Summoning Circle) Specializations: Inventing Spells +1; Vim +1 These enhancements cost 20 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Remaining Laboratories</div>
<div>There are three other laboratories that are currently unoccupied. Much of the valuable equipment has been reused elsewhere, and what has been left is decaying. They each have the following statistics. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: No Sanctum Marker Characteristics: Size +0 (–1), Refinement +0, General Quality –1, Upkeep –2 (1/2 Mythic Pound per year), Safety –1, Warping +0, Health +0, Aesthetics –2 Virtues & Flaws: Missing Equipment, Decaying, Missing Sanctum Marker Specializations: +2 Perdo Impossible Activities: Enchanting Items These extra laboratories costs the covenant 150 Build Points.</div>

<h3>Outlying Buildings</h3>

<div>To the south of the covenant’s main buildings, en route to the rear of the covenant, is the village. This is where Columb has his chapel and the rest of the grogs live. The homes are humble, but made of the same white stone as the covenant walls. Sheep and goats dot the hills on either side of the valley alongside the covenant’s herd of hardy cattle. Lines of robust drystone walls corral the livestock, allowing the farmers to control their movements. The wolf pelt cathach is displayed on a large x-shaped frame staked into the ground. Ropes secure the frame to the ground against the winds that rush down the valley. It is surrounded by a circular ward and is watched over by Prince Ruadan’s Túatha Dé Danann warriors (see below).</div>
<div>The Chapel</div>
<div>Columb Brathair’s chapel, built and provisioned in earlier times, has a Divine aura of 4. It houses a copy of the Bible (as described in The Church, page 49), and the recentlystarted parish register. The register is a Summa on Area Lore: Longmist, Lvl 1, Quality 5. These books cost a total of 53 Build Points. 55 Build Points have also been spent to outfit his small chapel with a significant relic. The covenant acquired the clapper from the iron bell that Saint Patrick used to knock the demon Caoranach out of the sky. This relic has four Faith Points and has the power to grant the supplicant the Strong Willed Virtue for one day at a cost of five of the Relic’s 40 Divine Might points. Visitors may be surprised at this, as the clapper is reputed to be housed in the Shrine of the Bell in Armagh, and indeed such a Divine relic can be found there. That two such relics can be found is surely God’s work indeed.</div>

<h3>Associated or Owned Properties</h3>

<div>There are now just two sources of income remaining, a small fishery, and a toll bridge. They are treated as a Lesser Income Source providing a total of 80 Mythic Pounds each year.</div>
<div>The Fish Runs</div>
<div>This is a series of looping channels cut into the banks of the stream feeding Lough Beagh. Fish traps have been set up here and the catch provides enough for the covenant and surplus for sale at nearby Inniskill market.</div>
<div>The Toll Bridge</div>
<div>The covenant controls a toll bridge to the south of Lough Beagh. Footfall is starting to dwindle as a larger toll bridge built further south by the English provides an alternative route. If things continue, it may be just five years before this source of income stops paying for itself. Unless something is done, each year from the time that play starts, reduce the earned income by 8 Mythic Pounds.</div>

<h3>External Relations</h3>

<div>Longmist has few external relations and its most favorable relationships are no longer with mortal kings or Hermetic covenants, but with the faeries who live beneath the ground and the spirits of the air.</div>

<h3>Clan Mac Tire</h3>

<div>The nomadic Clan Mac Tire, a collection of seven Bjornaer magi, is Longmist’s enemy. The founder of their line was murdered and skinned to provide Longmist’s cathach and it is an insult that the clan’s current leader, Cú Chonnacht Cluasach Mac Tire, has vowed to put right. This unofficial covenant moves across Hibernia with the seasons, setting up their mobile laboratories in one of the many booley villages, collections of simple dwellings occupied for only a season or two before the occupants move on to the next booley. Cú Chonnacht Cluasach Mac Tire is old and weak, and the faith of the clan has been shaken by too many failures to reclaim Ualgrimm’s pelt. His junior, Bán Mac Tire, who has a white wolf heartbeast, is growing impatient. In truth, he feels no connection to the cathach held by Longmist, but it is a wound to the clan that he is keen to exploit in order to strip Cú Chonnacht of his leadership. Bán wants to stop targeting the pelt itself and to begin targeted attacks against its protectors: Prince Ruadan and his subjects. Given their itinerant lifestyle, the clan lacks the raw magical power they need, but they now control a large band of robbers and mercenaries, enough to challenge the faerie powers that guard the cathach on Longmist’s behalf. It will not be long before</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Story Seed: The Dwindling Fish</h3>

<div>Few fish have been caught in the withies and those that have been are small. Where have all the fish gone? Is the covenant outstripping the land? Or perhaps the new magi upstream in search of a covenant location are stealing what belongs to Longmist. What does this mean for the vis sources?</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>an assault is mounted. Achieving peace with the Clan Mac Tire will not be an easy thing. The covenant’s cathach is at the heart of the conflict, and for Longmist to give that up they must first have a new trophy under which they are known at Tribunal.</div>
<div>Important Boons and Hooks</div>
<div>Troupes are free to provide as much or as little detail for Clan Mac Tire as they need, but there are some important covenant Boons and Hooks that help describe the covenant.</div>
<div>Criminals (Minor Residents Boon): Not only do the magi raid the resources belonging to other covenants, but they offer a haven to mundane criminals and outlaws. Difficult Access (Minor Fortifications Boon): Many of the booley villages that the covenant uses are built on islands in the middle of lakes, which provides protection against intrusion. As the covenant seeks out those with Magical auras, some even host regiones, which offer even more protection. Informants (Minor External Relations Boon): The covenant maintains links with</div>
<div>various robbers across Ulaid, whose information they use to plan their own activities. Hidden Resources (Minor Resource Boon): In order to reduce the amount that the covenant needs to carry with them, some of the covenant’s resources are stored in the booleys that they frequently visit. This means that not all covenant resources are immediately available. Hidden Ways (Minor Surroundings Boon): Both as wolves of the wilderness and as magi, the clan knows the best paths surrounding their regular booley camps.</div>

Vis: 8 pawns Rego, +2 if in the Otherworld Appearance: A tall and handsome man apparently in his early thirties, attractive were it not for his bright blue skin and red eyes. His blond hair is lustrous, and his oilblack armor fascinates in the torchlight.</div>
<div>His Might is increased by 10 when he is within his place of power; the labyrinth beneath Longmist. This is also where he maintains his workshop, which provides a +2 bonus to totals to create new arms and armor due to the exotic supplies and magical fires within its forge. This allows him to make Superior weapons and armor, with the exception of swords which are Excellent, as described in City & Guild, page 69.</div>
<div>While the quality of weapons and armor made by Ruadan is determined by the appropriate Pretense, his Blood of Goibhniu power allows him forge unusual substances. These could include moonlight, song, loss, anger, or the power of a storm. He may do this by expending 1 point from his Might Score, plus up to a further 9 points from his Might Score to enchant up to 45 levels of effect. This must be a single effect, and all the usual modifiers apply. Points spent in this way can only be regained by consuming faerie vis associated with the form of Vim, or by taking back the weapon and smelting it down.</div>
<div>Great Sword of the Moon</div>
<div>MuCo 45 Pen +20, Unlimited R: Sight, D: Concentration, T: Group When the sword is drawn, members of the target group who consider themselves Ruadan’s allies see the sword of the moon glow brightly with pure moonlight.

<div>This allows them to travel quickly and to gain an advantage over those traveling through their lands. Indiscreet Resource (Major Resource Hook): Most of the Clan’s income comes from theft, robbery, and coercion. Erratically Mobile (Minor Site Hook): The Clan moves frequently, sometimes staying just a season in each booley. Infamous (Minor External Relations Hook): The Clan Mac Tire is well-known by other covenants across Hibernia.</div>
<div>Income</div>
<div>The Clan makes what money it needs primarily from robbery, raiding, and in hiring its services to other magi and covenants. Their grogs are proficient enough thieves that they earn enough to pay for the provisions the covenant needs.</div>
<div>Mobile Laboratories</div>
<div>Each of the Mac Tire magi has a similar laboratory designed to be packed away for easy transport by the team of servants and soldiers in their employ. As these laboratories usually include the magus’ living quarters they have significant downsides, something that the younger magi in the covenant frequently complain about. Names Added to Sanctum Marker: None Characteristics: Size +0 (0), Refinement +0, General Quality +0, Upkeep –1, Safety –2, Warping +0, Health –5, Aesthetics –3 Virtues & Flaws: Lesser Feature (cauldron), Living Quarters, Mobile, Specimens, Servant; Hovel Specializations: +1 Animal, +2 Experimentation, +1 Mentem The servant (with Intelligence +2) is a learned clerk who sees to the needs of the magi in their laboratories. He does a good job for the magi but his loyalty is born of fear rather than attachment.</div>

<h3>Mundane Relations</h3>

<div>The days of entertaining kings and princes are long since gone. There are no hunts in the nearby woodland, no trade in enchanted items, and nobody comes seeking the wisdom of the druids any more. The only mundane relations now are through the goods sold at market, the travelers over the toll bridge, and the jealous eyes of those who weigh up the grogs that guard</div>
<div>the bridge and think that they could take it from them. If the magi of Longmist are not careful, they may soon find their grogs overrun and the toll-bridge lost. The market town of Inniskil is the closest the covenant gets to interacting with the outside world. Fish is sold at the market by the covenant’s teamsters, and this funds the purchase of food and other supplies. Some of the merchants know the nature of the covenant, but most believe it is some kind of monastery or hermitage.</div>
<div>Ruadan mac Goibhniu</div>
<div>Ruadan is a prince and druid of the Túatha Dé Danann, descended from Goibhniu the smith of ancient legend. He has the same power of crafting and enchantment as his forebear, but it is his counsel that benefits the covenant more than his magic. He acts as a mediator between the covenant and the faerie world, providing guidance on the covenant’s interactions with the fae. His soldiers are also responsible for guarding the covenant’s cathach against raids from other covenants. His right to sit at the council is enshrined in the covenant charter and his principal ally is Conchobor. Like Conchobor, he calls for the isolation of the valley to be maintained and to let the world outside do as it will. In fact, where his counsel is sought upon various matters, he takes the line that maintains the covenant’s isolation. While he rarely plots against the covenant as a whole, he has in the past worked against individual magi where their activities might either take them away from the valley or bring others to it. His reasons are currently unknown.</div>
<div>Giants</div>
<div>Giants are a frequent concern. They come down from the hills and mountains when the weather is harsh or food scarce. They mostly take the occasional sheep but they have been known to attempt cattle. They rarely work together, and often fight. As they do not understand boundaries or dwellings, they have been known to blunder into the village while crossing the valley. They usually cause more incidental damage than intentional, And they can usually be persuaded to move on with the promise of food or some shiny bauble. Use the statistics provided in Realms of Power: Faerie, page 98 for faerie giants, and</div>
<div>the statistics for Barcas provided in Realms of Power: Magic, page 86 for magical giants. Ruadan mac Goibhniu often speaks on behalf of the covenant where faerie giants are concerned, but he has no influence with beasts of the Magic realm.</div>
<div>Faerie Merchants</div>
<div>With the exception of Inniskil market, the covenant rarely trades with outsiders. This is partly due to the train of faerie merchants who appear each midsummer’s eve. They stay for three days and nights, during which time the covenant buys laboratory tools and glasswork, the kind of supplies that cannot be found at Inniskil. There is little to distinguish the rickety wagons pulled by oxen from those of mundane pedlars, apart from the absence of iron and the ability of their animals to talk. They appear to want nothing unusual in payment for their goods. Equipment purchased from them has no detrimental effect to laboratory work and appears to be entirely mundane, though where it comes from is another question. The faerie merchants are under instruction from Ruadan to return each year and it is he who enforces the time and duration of their visits.</div>
<div>The Banshee and Her Kind</div>
<div>There are banshees in Ulaid who watch over the Ulaidh and sing laments for their impending deaths. As a deathbed visitor, the banshee has been seen and heard many times near the covenant in its history, but it is also common for people of the surrounding area to brave the unnatural mists and seek help and advice from the magi of Longmist. See Realms of Power: Faerie, page 80 for more details on banshees.</div>
<div>Elemental Spirits</div>
<div>Both Lugh and Dara are summoners and controllers of spirits. As their arts are ancient they are well-understood by the elemental spirits of Ireland and the spirits are generally well-inclined toward them and to the covenant by extension, though there are some, mostly spirits of fire, that are fearful and resentful of the magi. On the whole, persons claiming friendship or kinship with Lugh or Dara are looked upon more kindly by the elemental spirits than those who do not.</div>
<div>Druids</div>
<div>The name of Longmist used to carry respect among the druids of Hibernia, but it has been many generations since Longmist actively pursued friendship. Lugh and Dara’s heritage as summoners counts for something, though many hedge wizards of Hibernia consider it a great pity that they have been turned to the Order of Hermes. Connacht is still forbidden ground to the Order, so it pays to have contacts and allies across the border. Unfortunately, it has been so long now since Longmist had any dealings with them that they will need to find new contacts and build new relationships. However, at present, with its voice at Tribunal muted, the covenant has little to offer in return.</div>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<div>Longmist traded many of their older resources with the druids of Connacht to ensure that they secured apprentices, and lost many others during engagements with faerie rogues. The resources described below represent those that remain. There are many others that have been lost, broken, or whose magic has expired. This is particularly true of many of the Verditius devices that the covenant has seen in its history.</div>

<h3>Enchanted Devices</h3>

<div>The following describes the items known to still be at Longmist. These cost 142 Build Points. Many others that once enhanced life at Longmist have been lost or broken and some have even been taken to the Hermetic graveyard at the covenant of Qui Sonant Pro Quieto to be buried with their creators.</div>
<div>Ualgrimm’s Pelt</div>
<div>This is the covenant’s Cathach. It has the power to turn the wearer into a wolf, similar to the common Hermetic spell Shape Of The Woodland Prowler, a power it supposedly gained through warping at Ualgrimm’s last stand. MuCo(An) 25 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Concentration, T: Individual This power is triggered by placing the pelt over the target, and that target is trans</div>
<div>formed into a wolf. The target may change back at will, ending the effect. The effect is a physical transformation and the target’s mind and character are unchanged. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration; Modifications: +5 device maintains concentration) The pelt costs 10 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Enchanted Door</div>
<div>InVi(Im) 30 Pen +0, unlimited use R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Vision This door installed into a wall in the lesser tower opens into the greater tower by spanning the regio boundary. This allows covenfolk without Second Sight to move freely between the regio layers by simply touching the door, which reveals the regio. Movement through the door does not cause Warping. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +4 Vision, free requisite; +10 unlimited use) The door costs 12 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Broken Shield of Cú Chulainn</div>
<div>Split into two halves, this wooden shield trimmed with a sharpened iron edge was clearly designed for a very large man. It was once a faerie weapon that passed on the skill to use it to its wielder. If it could be magically mended, the wielder would generate a Single Weapon Defense Total as though he had a Single Weapon skill of 10. It is displayed in Longmist’s great hall and costs 10 Build Points.</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>Story Seed: A Service for a Service</div>
<div>Ruadan’s Túatha may protect the covenant and its Cathach, but they demand service in return. These things may be simple, such as confronting a dangerous presence in their underground home, or more subtle, such as bringing them the tears of a mother bereft of her child. Ruadan leaves no option for the magi of Longmist: if the service is refused, then the bargain that protects the Cathach is broken.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Cearnach’s Mount</div>
<div>This device, in the shape of a small wooden figurine of a horse and rider attached to a leather thong, creates a horse, accepting of The Gift, suitable for a magus to ride. The device is normally worn around the neck, but the leather thong on the device is now very brittle and could easily break if mishandled.</div>
<div>Cr(Re)An(Te) 51 Pen +0, 2/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group This effect creates a living horse and riding tack at the user’s command. The horse becomes fatigued as normal and must be fed and tended, but it is compliant to those with The Gift. In addition, a magus may substitute his Finesse Score for Ride or Animal Handling when riding or interacting with the summoned animal. An Intelligence + Finesse roll is used to determine the quality of the saddle, bridle, and reins. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Rego, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Size, +2 Group; Modifications: +1 2/day) The device costs 22 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Bronze Man</div>
<div>The large bronze statue of a bare-chested bearded craftsman standing in the courtyard has a classical countenance but the complex joints give away its true design. It is an automaton crafted by Faventinus of Verditius, the Cailleach’s grand-parens. He used it as a forge assistant, but something happened to make him send the Bronze Man into the courtyard never to return. Those in the covenant who took notice of the Bronze Man never asked why it was there and most now assume it to be just a statue. Its Might is damaged (it currently has an effective Might of 6 and –5 on any Ability rolls) and to repair it requires the Verditius Automata Inner Mystery (Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 128). This Inner Mystery is not required to investigate its powers, however. This can be done in the normal way as a standard laboratory action. Doing so reveals the command words to reactivate the Bronze Man. Although mute, the Bronze Man has seen and heard everything that has happened in the courtyard for the last 80 years. If it can be coaxed back to its normal functioning, the device can follow instructions of any complexity given to it that concern its blacksmithing and any other instructions that neither require a positive Intelligence nor an Ability score other than Craft: Blacksmith. The Bronze Man costs 48 Build Points. Similar automata had been created to open and close the main gates on command, but these are broken. There was once also a bronze bull, the prize of Longmist’s herd, but that has not been seen for many years.</div>
<div>The Observance Bell</div>
<div>There was a time when the covenfolk did not have to wake at all hours and ring the great bell for their masters’ convenience. Once upon a time, magic did that task for them, but the magic in the bell died nearly forty years ago. Nobody is quite sure why and as long as there are covenfolk to ring the bell by hand the magi have expressed no interest in finding out. This bronze bell is not large, counting only as a medium-sized device for enchantment purposes, and had been opened with 15 pawns of vis. A cursory examination shows the bell to have a crack in its side, a crack that seems to have been sufficient to break the magic. Closer inspection shows a</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The Missing Cathach</h3>

<div>When a magus discovers a laboratory text in Longmist’s library describing the form and power of the Cathach down to the last detail, the suspicion rises that the true cathach has been lost, replaced by an enchantment. If word of this got out, the covenant could fall as none of its resources would enjoy legal protection under the Code. Do the magi hide the discovery, bring it to council, or, assuming that it really is missing, try to find the true Cathach? But who would take it and why hasn’t the Tribunal already heard about it?</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The Cattle Raid</h3>

<div>Éamonn reports seeing a mechanical bull amid the herd of a Leinster covenant. Is this the bull missing from Longmist for so many years? If so, do the magi take the matter to Tribunal or, in the manner of the old ways, do they plan a raid to snatch the bull and return it to Longmist?</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>shallow dent at the top of the crack, suggesting a strike with some kind of hammer. The Laboratory Texts for each of its effects are held within the library, and these give a magus the means to re-enchant it. Given the number of pawns used to open it, the bell would not need to be opened a second time to take the following effects.</div>
<div>Divine the Heavens’ Aspect InVi 29 Pen +0, Constant Effect R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Individual As per the effect detailed in The Mysteries: Revised Edition, page 51, the bell has the ability to “watch the heavens” and take constant measurements as to the movement of the sun and the moon through the day and night, the phase of the moon, the seasons, and the year. This provides enough information to trigger the other effects invested within the bell. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set)</div>
<div>Toll the Offices ReTe 12 Pen +0, 12/day R: Personal, D: Diameter, T: Individual Designed into this effect are the hours and offices of Longmist. At the time for each, the bell tolls, sounding through the covenant, calling the magi to assemble. (Effect: Base 2, +2 metal, +1 Diameter; Modifications: +4 for 12/day, +3 triggered by Divine the Heavens’ Aspect)</div>
<div>Toll the Phases of the Moon ReTe 8 Pen +0, 1/day R: Personal, D: Diameter, T: Individual This effect tolls the bell at each significant phase of the moon, such as new, quarter, and full moons. (Effect: Base 2, +2 metal, +1 Diameter; Modifications: +3 triggered by Divine the Heavens’ Aspect)</div>
<div>Toll the Equinoxes and the Solstices ReTe 8 Pen +0, 1/day R: Personal, D: Diameter, T: Individual This effect tolls the bell at each equinox and solstice through the year. (Effect: Base 2, +2 metal, +1 Diameter; Modifications: +3 triggered by Divine the Heavens’ Aspect)</div>

<h3>Prepared Casting Spaces</h3>

<div>The greater tower houses a dedicated casting space in the form of a large circular chamber. The polished white stone floor is inscribed with various interlocking and separate circles, the walls contain glass mirrors that direct light, and from the ceiling hang numerous braziers. These props provide a +5 to casting totals for spells cast within the room and ceremonial magic cast here takes just one minute per magnitude. See Houses of Hermes: Societates, pages 58–60 for more information.</div>
<div>Library</div>
<div>Longmist’s library is a wondrous thing. Housed in the greater tower, it occupies two levels joined by a spiral staircase. Sections branch off radially, like spokes in a cartwheel, and a multitude of texts rest flat on ranks of shelves. The Longmist library contains many books written in an outdated dialect, a staid writing style, and even volumes that include many references to other works. Such works are often more difficult to work with than others without affecting their inherent quality. To model this, activities can be given an</div>
<div>additional cost in days distraction. This is a number of extra days that the magus needs to expend toward the activity. Normally, the magus may take a ten-day distraction without incurring a penalty toward the activity. A particularly heavy-weight book may require a five or even ten day distraction by itself in order to benefit. Some of the books below impose this distraction. A total of 1089 Build Points has been spent on the library across Abilities, Arts, Casting Tablets, and Laboratory Texts. Texts marked with an asterisk are written in vernacular Gaelic. All other texts are in Latin.</div>
<div>Arcane Abilities</div>
<div>218 Build Points have been spent on Arcane Abilities, such as Finesse, Magic Theory, Parma Magica, and Penetration. The library also contains texts on each of the Realms as well as texts concerning the Sihr Ability of the Corrguineach. One of these books was given to the covenant by Brea Mac Boru, the druid killed during Dara’s reckless summonings. A number of these volumes have been written in Gaelic, and one of these, the Lebor Feasa Runda,</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>The Blade that Slew the Wolf</div>
<div>This great sparra, a traditional Irish ax, is the weapon that slew Ualgrimm, giving Longmist its Cathach. Its laboratory texts are now lost. The sparra stands five feet tall, and has a long gently curved haft of rowan wood, and a narrow protruding iron head, which is etched with Irish knotwork and Hermetic symbols inlaid with silver. It has seen the ministrations of a skilled Verditius, which has improved its combat statistics. Hannewalt of Tytalus created the sparra and his sigil expresses in these effects through an arc of mist that trails the head when it is swung. Bran is currently the only man able to wield the sparra to good effect, but he is not routinely armed with it. The sparra has the following combat statistics:</div>
<div>Ability  Init Atk Dfn Dam Str Load Great Sparra Great +1 +10 0 +11 +12</div>
<div>Death with Each Blow PeAn 38 Pen +40, 6/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual If the effect penetrates a beast’s Magic Resistance, it is instantly struck with a Medium wound in addition to any wound that the ax blow itself causes. (Base 10, +1 Touch; +3 6/day, +20 for +40 Penetration)</div>
<div>Dull the Stamina of the Wolf PeAn 31 Pen +40, 6/day R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual Triggered when the linked Death with Each Blow effect penetrates, this effect fatigues the target animal, causing the beast to lose a Fatigue Level. (Base 4, +1 Touch; +3 triggered by Death with Each Blow, +3 for 6/day, +20 for +40 Penetration) The sparra costs 28 Build Points.</div>

<div>Shape and Material Bonuses for the Boibel Loth</div>
<div>The Boibel Loth is an ancient writing system consisting of sixteen characters. In addition to their function in written language, each of the characters has mystical associations, which in their inscribed form contribute Shape and Material bonuses toward magical projects. A minor breakthrough (Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, page 26) is needed to rediscover this old magic and grant access to the power of the Boibel Loth. Doing so allows the magus to incorporate the symbols into their enchantments and also to design them into rituals, where they provide a bonus to the casting total. They can also be used in Charm Magic as distinct Charms. See Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 96 for more detail.</div>

<h3>Vis Stocks</h3>

<div>278 Build Points have been spent on vis, of which 80 Build Points have been spent on vis stocks and the remainder on sources. Some of the sources contain vis in the form of Extraordinary Vis, as described in Realms of Power: Magic. These stocks have been built up across many years and many of the pawns of vis are covered in dust or lie forgotten in the bottom of chests. That a Hibernian covenant has collected and stored so much vis is considered unusual.</div>
<div>The Fleas of Saint Nannan</div>
<div>There is a certain village in Connacht that in years gone by was infested with fleas. The people of that village did not know what to do to rid themselves of this vermin and so they turned to Saint Nannan. Divine power swept away every last flea and put them in a nearby meadow and to this day not a single flea may live in that village, but the meadow is so brimming with them that no man nor beast may stay long there.</div>
<div>Long before Giraldus Cambrensis described this oddity in his History and Topography of Ireland, Longmist had acquired samples of the earth from both the village and the meadow and found that both contain spell-like vis. Both types are of Animal and they each have one of the following effects. Rego Animal 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group Each pawn of vis scattered on the ground, whether that is earth, stone, sand, or even inside a building, spontaneously generates 1000</div>
<div>fleas. While their production is a thing of magic, the magic is simply accelerating a natural phenomenon and as a result these fleas are natural and unaffected by Magic Resistance. These cost 3 Build Points per 5 pawns of vis. (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group) Perdo Animal 45 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group Each pawn of vis scattered on the ground, whether that is earth, stone, sand, or even inside a building, immediately kills animals up to a standard group. The effect does</div>

<h3>Lost or Broken Devices</h3>

<div>There have been many devices created by many magi across Longmist’s long history, and many of these are unfortunately lost or broken. For some, the Laboratory Texts remain and they could be remade with just a little investment of time and vis.</div>
<div>Balance of the Honest Merchant</div>
<div>Pen +0, 6/day InTe 8 R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual This lesser enchanted device, once entrusted to teamsters and other covenfolk, checks whether the weight of something bought at market is as agreed. It takes the form of an iron hook attached to a short length of rope. The device is triggered by looping the hook into the item to be weighed, usually a bale or barrel, and pulling upon the short handle of rope. The device user immediately learns the target’s weight to the desired level of detail, be it a grain, an ounce, a pound, or a ton. The laboratory text for this device costs 2BP. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch; Modifications: +3 for 6/day)</div>
<div>Honesty of the    Unbalanced Merchant</div>
<div>Pen +20, 6/day ReMe 28 R: Touch, D: Momentary, T: Individual The effect, enchanted into a plain and unobtrusive ring as a lesser enchantment, is activated upon shaking hands with the target. It strongly inclines the target to be truthful, going so far as to admit any lie, deception, or other untruth just told to the device wearer. This is not automatic, however. An Untruthful or similar Personality Trait roll against an Ease Factor of 9 is required for the target to avoid immediately blurting out the truth. The ring was given to covenfolk going to market to ensure to help them avoid be</div>
<div>ing taken advantage of by canny and ruthless traders. The ring is designed to include a Penetration score in order to deal with traders and merchants who might hide behind relics or even Infernal protection. The laboratory text for this device costs 6BP. (Effect: Base 10, +1 Touch; Modifications: +3 for 6/day, +10 for +20 Penetration)</div>
<div>Cearnach’s Distant Twin</div>
<div>The laboratory texts describe a device of wood and bronze in the shape of a man, articulated at the joints such that it can mimic normal human motion. However, it is actually a much smaller copy of this figure, carved from the same wood, that is enchanted and each enchantment acts at Arcane Connection range upon the larger figure. It was designed and built by Cearnach of Verditius and while the completed control device was burned and damaged beyond repair shortly after its completion, the laboratory texts describing the enchantments remain. It is said that Cearnach suffered from the Blatant Gift and this device was designed to allow him to interact with individuals in person without the problem of his Gift coming between them. This greater enchantment has several effects to allow the device user to act over a distance. The first animates the wooden form, the second allows the device user to see and hear through it, and the third clothes the device in the user’s own image. There are references in the texts to a fourth experimental device effect that could allow the user to cast magic through the device, but if it was ever completed the laboratory text for it no longer exists. The laboratory texts for this device cost a total of 31 Build Points.</div>
<div>Animate this Form Pen +0, Unlimited ReHe 50 R: Arcane Connection, D: Concentration, T: Individual</div>
<div>This effect animates the wooden man under the control of the device user. Even relatively fine movements are no problem under calm conditions, although a Finesse roll is required under stress. The wooden man has physical statistics of 0 for each of Strength, Stamina, Dexterity, and Quickness and these are used in place of the magus’ own. (Effect: Base 10, +4 Arcane Connection, +1 Concentration; +5 device maintains concentration, +10 unlimited use)</div>
<div>His Sight Is Mine Pen +0, Unlimited InIm 60 R: Arcane Connection, D: Concentration, T: Special Allows the magus to operate all senses at a distance through the target wooden figure. (Effect: Base 5, +4 Arcane Connection, +1 Concentration, +3 for special Target; Modifications: +5 device maintains concentration, +10 unlimited use)</div>
<div>Clothe this Form Pen +0, Unlimited MuIm 45 R: Arcane Connection, D: Concentration, T: Individual This effect changes all species emitted by the target figure into those normally emitted by the device’s user. A Finesse roll is required, as described in ArM5, page 143 but the device creator gains a +3 to this roll. Cearnach’s original version of this effect included one experimental sideeffect; the image is mirrored such that a scar on the left hand appears on the right. The movement of the image is unaffected, however. (Effect: Base 5, +4 Arcane Connection, +1 Concentration; Modifications: +5 device maintains concentration, +10 unlimited use)</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>not discriminate between types of animals so great care must be taken in handling this vis. These cost 6 Build Points per 5 pawns of vis. (Base 30, +1 Touch, +2 Group) The covenant owns fifteen pawns of the flea-generating soil and five of the soil harmful to animals.</div>
<div>The Burning Hand</div>
<div>A macabre gift to the covenant from the Túatha Dé Danann, this lesser enchantment vis takes the form of a left hand cut from a corpse and any candle placed between its fingers never goes out. The hand contains 5 pawns of Ignem vis and the following effect. CrIg 9 A candle placed in the hand’s upturned fingers immediately ignites and remains lit with a magical flame until the candle is removed. (Effect: Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) The burning hand costs 2 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Balm of Tír Nan Óg</div>
<div>This faerie gift has the power to resolve a terminal aging crisis. CrCo 40 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind When the balm is applied to the stricken target, the rigors of age and infirmity are held at bay and the target gains the strength to overcome the crisis. One dose of the balm was applied by Lugh</div>
<div>to The Cailleach’s parens, Tadhg an Tuir, when he fell gravely ill but even its power seemed insufficient to save the elderly magus. (Base 35, +1 Touch) Each dose of the balm contains four pawns of Creo vis, costing 4 Build Points. If the dose is split then the inherent magic is lost. There are five doses remaining for a total of 20 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Ax of Cú Roí mac Dáire</div>
<div>This ax, seemingly too large for a normal man to wield, is a faerie weapon. Supposedly once belonging to the Ulaidh king Cú Roí mac Dáire, this great ax is imbued with the strength and skill to use it. The weapon statistics are as the regular Pole Ax in ArM5, page 176, but any man, woman, or child with a Brave Personality Trait of +3 or more benefits from the Heroic Combat pretense and may use the Ax one-handed as though they had the appropriate Ability score of 10. The ax replaces the normal +1 Strength requirement with the +3 Brave Personality Trait requirement. This effect has a Penetration of +10, which must penetrate the wielder’s Magic Resistance and not that possessed by potential targets. The ax contains ten pawns of Mentem accrued faerie vis and the item costs 10 Build Points. See Realms of Power: Faerie, pages 19 and 62 for more details on accrued vis and pretenses.</div>

<h3>Vis Sources</h3>

<div>The covenant has the following ten sources to draw from. These days, it is rare for them all to be collected in a single year.</div>
<div>Tribute from the Underworld</div>
<div>Four pawns of Corpus per Year The Túatha Dé Danann entered into a pact with the covenant of Longmist many years ago. As part of that pact, while good relations persist between the Túatha Dé Danann and Longmist, they promised to lead the covenant to vis that only the Túatha Dé Danann could see.</div>

<div>The covenant could not have foreseen that this meant unearthing bodies from their graves. The Túatha Dé Danann lead the covenant to a single human body each season. When unearthed, this body is found to contain one pawn of vis. The secret, unknown to Longmist, is that the bodies themselves do not generate the vis, nor are they subject to the affects of a Magical aura or chance event; it is placed there through Túatha Dé Danann magic. The Túatha Dé Danann have their own sources of vis, but why would they go through this charade? It may be that the aim was to make the magi of Longmist party to something clandestine and unseemly, and so closer bind them in something secret. 20 Build Points</div>
<div>From the Very Walls Themselves</div>
<div>Four pawns Vim vis per Year Centuries within the strong aura have taken their toll on the lesser tower of Longmist and parts of it now express vis each year. One pawn of Vim vis may be collected each season, but the vis accretes in the roof tiles, in the cobbles outside, or even in the walls. Over the years, this has resulted in the tower, the courtyard, and the roof becoming pockmarked through stones having been taken away for the vis that they contain. Some gaps have been hastily patched with mortar or stones picked from the ground. This is, however, a Dwindling Resource, as described earlier. That means it is losing 10% of its yield each year. In effect, after</div>
<div>three years, the yield drops to three pawns; after five years it drops to two; to one pawn after eight years; and it finally dries up altogether after ten. 20 Build Points</div>
<div>The Swine in the Woods</div>
<div>Four pawns of Herbam each Autumn In addition to the herd of cattle and a few goats, the covenant keeps swine. They were originally brought to the covenant when a source of vis was found in the woodlands not far from Longmist. The pigs were particularly sensitive to the vis that grew in the form of mushrooms and other fungi. A trained swineherd can use the pigs to forage for the vis and take the vis-bearing morsels before the pigs eat them. 20 Build Points</div>
<div>Gold Teeth from the Pike Pulled</div>
<div>Three Pawns of Terram per Year There is a fearsome pike that returns to the same stretch of water each spring to take a new wife from the gathered pike. A quick and brave fisherman can catch this pike with his bare hands, wrestle it to the bank, and there extract three gleaming teeth of gold. Each of these small but sharp teeth contains a whole pawn of Terram vis. In years gone by the covenant would hold a small feast in honor of the pike and would make its pursuit something of a competition among the covenant’s men-folk. That no longer happens and the contest with</div>
<div>the pike is now a dangerous chore. 15 Build Points</div>
<div>The Leeward Side</div>
<div>8 Pawns of Vim per Year There are certain trees in woodlands not far from Longmist where the lichen grows not on the sunward side of the trunks, but on the reverse. This lichen may be collected for two pawns of Vim vis each season. 40 Build Points</div>
<div>The Gifted Blacksmith</div>
<div>2 Pawns of Creo per year Cathal Gobha is far from Gifted, but with his forge always within a Magical aura, his work often used as the basis for enchanted items, and the raw creative forces of fire, fuel, and iron, it is not surprising that vis accumulates there. Some seasons, he finds a piece of worked iron of extreme purity that gives off its own internal heat. These glassy-black shards are too hot to be held in the hand and must be kept in water, submerged in oil, or buried in the ground in case they damage their surroundings.</div>
<div>Shard of Iron CrIg 14 Pen +0, constant effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Ind As per the Heat of the Searing Forge spell in ArM5, page 140. (Effect: Base 4, +2 Sun; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) 12 Build Points</div>
<div>The Needfire</div>
<div>Six pawns of Creo each year In a ritual described in the Lebor Feasa Runda, on the night of Beltane, the covenant convenes on land outside the Aegis and lights a large fire built from staves of willow, hazel, alder, birch, rowan, yew, elm, oak, and ash. An individual passed three times through the smoke of the needfire benefits from an effect similar to Cheating The Reaper with a Penetration of +10, ArM5, page 129. This applies to any living being, whether human, animal, Fir Bolg, or otherwise. This is pre-Hermetic magic and once the manner of making the needfire is known, it can be lit year after year, but only within a Magical aura, and the Aegis of the Hearth suppresses the effect. Where the restorative effects of the needfire are not called upon, the charred remains of the staves contain Creo vis. Some claim to have experienced visions when looking into the smoke, which suggests that the needfire may have other, as yet undiscovered, properties. 30 Build Points</div>
<div>The Black Root</div>
<div>One pawn of Perdo per year Úna, the covenant’s herbwife, has to tend her gardens well as there is a persistent presence that means harm to her herbs. Each autumn, one of her plants develops a black root. If left to grow, the root poisons all those plants around it. Once taken from the ground, the root’s power is destroyed, but it retains a pawn of Perdo vis. The root itself may grow on any of Úna’s plants; an onion one year and a parsley plant the next. On rare occasions an additional black root may be found, either in Autumn or at some other time of the year, meaning that Úna needs to be vigilant. 5 Build Points</div>
<div>The Floating Stones of Maghera</div>
<div>One pawn of Rego each Year Each year, the ground in a small grove five miles north of the Maghera Falls provides one pawn of Rego vis in the form of a single stone, little bigger than a fist, that can be identified by a long stony root that protrudes from its base and secures it deep in the ground. The stone may be quite easily broken from this slender root, but at this point it takes a group of men with a combined strength of +5 to move it. Each pawn has a constant power, described below, that makes them useful as enchanted items in their own right; when moved, they remain where they are put, even if they have no natural means of support. Many of these stones have been used through the years to create floating lecterns and work tables, and to suspend large lanterns in the air among other things. These pawns, used as enchanted devices, are bought with the points for Vis Stocks, as listed above. The source of these stones falls outside of lands recognized by the Tribunal and is therefore not protected by Hibernia’s peripheral code. ReTe 14 Pen +0, constant effect R: Personal, D: Sun, T: Ind Each stone has a power similar to the Unseen Porter spell in ArM5, page 154, that affects the stone itself. The stones are seemingly not impeded by objects placed above it, and they have the power to hold things aloft. It takes a strong man to move one of the stones but once moved it remains where it was put, without any visible means of support. (Effect: Base 3, +2 Sun, +1 Stone; Modifications: +1 for 2/day, +3 triggered at sunrise/set) 6 Build Points</div>
<div>The Hunt</div>
<div>Six pawns of various Arts each Year The hills and valleys in the west of Ulaid are rich in vis that grows in the many lowlevel Magical auras common to this area. The pawns are found by a magus taking a tenday distraction, though this may be spread across the four seasons. The vis is rarely the same each year, and thus requires a distraction from study to search for it. Animal and Herbam are most common. The hunt is now rarely conducted. It is also conducted outside lands recognized by the Tribunal and so is not protected under Hibernia’s peripheral code. 30 Build Points</div>

<h3>Wealth</h3>

<div>30 Build Points have been spent on wealth, and this equates to 300 Mythic Pounds in monetary value. Very little of this is in the form of actual money as whatever is gained through the income sources is soon spent on running the covenant. Instead, there are large tapestries that once kept the walls insulated, and there is fine linen, silk, velvet, and fur bedding, glass for the windows, fine silver plates and cutlery. All these things hark back to the days when the covenant would entertain princes and receive gifts in exchange for their hospitality. None of this is used. It has all been stored away as the finery and comfort is considered a distraction. Longmist has a +1 Living Standards Modifier as appropriate for a Winter covenant (ArM5, page 170). However, the covenant’s vast store of wealth can be turned into an additional +1 if it is used as intended. Doing so requires a magus to spend a season dedicated to overseeing the installation of the glass back into the windows, the hanging of the tapestries, and so on, ensuring that the other trappings of wealth are used.</div>

<h3>Hidden Resources</h3>

<div>While many resources have been lost or destroyed across the centuries, including those whose magic failed when their creators died or entered Twilight, there are no further hidden resources waiting to be rediscovered. Any books, devices, or sources of vis that might once have belonged to Longmist are now the object of stories and are not bought out of the covenant’s Build Points. One item of note is the Bronze Bull. The covenant library contains laboratory texts for the creation of an automaton in the form of a great bull but the whereabouts of the bull itself is unknown. However, a story seed is included above that suggests that it may be found in a herd belonging to another covenant, seemingly the subject of a cattle raid many years ago. Troupes using Longmist as a player covenant may want to take the Hidden Resources Boon, balanced by the Contested Resource Hook in order to provide a further 250 Build Points of resources, representing those scattered far and wide. Reclaiming these lost resources then becomes an ongoing saga thread</div>

<h3>The Covenant in Play</h3>

<div>Longmist has been designed as a player covenant that provides ample resources for young magi brave enough to go against the strictures of their elders.</div>

<h3>Covenant Themes</h3>

<div>The themes of a Longmist saga are isolation, tradition, and conflict. These three themes shape the character of each magus at Longmist and strongly influence their attitudes to outsiders. Isolation: Although Hibernia is a small Tribunal, Longmist has built a wall around itself: a wall of quiet scorn for a world that moves on without it. Hermetic links and relationships have not been maintained and the magi look to themselves and their traditions for comfort. The covenant’s isolation has served it well. The Schism War did little overt dam</div>
<div>age to the covenant and, with the exception of the Mac Tire Clan, the covenant has no political enemies of which to speak. Tradition: Longmist has not lasted this long without building its own traditions. The magi live under strict rules and their days are rigidly prescribed from the time they rise to the time they retire. The magi rely upon ritual and rite, and the covenant has purist views upon magic, shunning the Mysteries in favor of theoretical contemplation of the Arts. The discipline of tradition, like isolation, has so far protected the covenant from hubris, corruption, and dissent. The magi are, the covenant teaches, stronger and more accomplished together than they are apart and that shared tradition is what binds them. Conflict: There are those who favor the faerie Túatha Dé Danann who live beneath the ground, and there are those who distrust them. And there are those who long to embrace the world beyond the covenant against the wishes of those who close up its walls against outsiders and hold to its traditions.</div>

<h3>Player Character Roles at Longmist</h3>

<div>The elder magi are designed to fill troupecontrolled roles: assigning tasks, causing obstructions, and keeping the younger magi in line with the covenant traditions. Lugh, in particular, may task the younger magi with writing and obtaining the texts on Magic Theory that he needs to prolong his life. The four younger magi described in this chapter are suitable as player characters. They each have their own magical and personal goals, which may conflict with the tradition-centric elder magi. These younger magi have the power to change the covenant’s direction, to rejuvenate it and make the most of the covenant’s resources. The covenant charter allows for specific roles and titles, which the player magi may move for. With each role gained, the player characters gain more political weight within the covenant and become more able to determine its future.</div>

<h3>Suggested Storylines</h3>

<div>There are several main storylines to address with a Longmist saga, and they cover threats from within the covenant in addition to threats from the outside.</div>
<div>The Death of the Elders</div>
<div>Neither Lugh nor Conchobor can live forever and it really is just a question of which one goes first. Of course, while it may seem that one without the other would bring a certain peace to the covenant, there is the potential for greater harm. Without the balance, supporters of the dead magus may find themselves mistreated by the supporters of the survivor. It is for the younger magi to contain this resentment and steer the covenant through a difficult time.</div>
<div>Covenant Governance</div>
<div>Longmist’s internal governance is an important storyline. Many magi might find the covenant’s traditions and way of life restrictive and even demeaning to their status as a magus. The younger magi have so far known little else. That may not remain the case, and the younger magi may push either for control of the covenant or at least to change the manner of its governance, against the wishes of the elder magi. Lugh and Conchobor currently control the dysfunctional council, but if the younger magi could place themselves into the vacant offices, they would gain additional votes and power, allowing them to start setting the covenant’s agenda. Stories around governance are a good fit for Eochaid and Mícheál; the former as he tends to fall foul of the covenant’s rule and Mícheál as he is nominally responsible for ensuring that the rule is followed. Stories concerning governance arise out of the Fractured Council and Divided Loyalty Hooks.</div>
<div>Rebuilding the Covenant</div>
<div>Longmist is in need of repair. Its finances also are in a poor state and this also needs to be addressed. How long before someone is injured by crumbling masonry or one of the stored tapestries needs to be sold in order to pay for provisions? Stories of rebuilding the covenant are going to involve the younger magi taking the lead, perhaps even going against the instructions of their elders by inviting new craftsmen to the covenant or seeking out new sources of income. Stories of rebuilding the covenant arise from the Crumbling and Dwindling Resource Hooks.</div>
<div>Clan mac Tire</div>
<div>Relations with Clan mac Tire continue to be antagonistic, including attempts upon the Cathach, unless the magi of Longmist put an end to the trouble. This requires either negotiation or force. The Clan accepts nothing less than the handing over of Ualgrimm’s pelt, but in doing so the covenant loses its Cathach. Taking this route involves the discovery and declaration of a new trophy. The alternative is continued and escalating conflict. Stories center around the Clan’s attempts to retrieve Ualgrimm’s pelt, through infiltration and stealth, frontal assault, attacking Ruadan’s people, or through working with allies who take the fight to Longmist. There are also opportunities to play the “enemy of my enemy” card and find situations for a temporary truce in the face of a greater common enemy. Given his traumatic personal experience with the Clan, Mícheál should be a</div>
<div>central character in stories concerning the Clan mac Tire. Stories around the Clan mac Tire arise from the Contested Resource Hook.</div>
<div>Alliance with the Túatha Dé Danann</div>
<div>The Túatha Dé Danann are an ally to the covenant but their aims are not yet clear, though Ruadan certainly works hard to keep the valley and the covenant isolated. As immortals, they may consider playing the covenant for centuries as but the blink of an eye, but can the magi of Longmist discover their plans and release the covenant from their influence? Ruadan’s plan seems centered on continuing Longmist’s isolation, but there seems no particular reason for it. As an immortal of the Túatha Dé Danann, however, Ruadan may only now be ready to put his plans into effect. Perhaps the covenant is offered an apprentice with Túatha Dé Danann blood, someone who can start to take over the covenant from within, or perhaps Ruadan starts to influence Longmist’s research to lift the curse that keeps the Túatha Dé Danann out of the sunlight. Given Eochaid’s suspicions concerning</div>
<div>Ruadan’s motives, he would make the ideal central character for these stories. Given his ability to commune with spirits and his connections with the other races of Hibernia, Dara would also figure prominently. These stories arise out of the Faerie Court Hook.</div>
<div>Rejoining Hermetic Society</div>
<div>Longmist has been distant from the Tribunal for a lifetime and more. Those within the covenant may see the time as right to rejoin Hermetic society, and embrace trade and exchange. Such a course may bring dangers, as magi take advantage of the covenant’s naivety. Eochaid, The Cailleach, and Dara specifically all have views at odds with both Lugh and Conchobor. Given his responsibilities, Mícheál is expected to uphold Longmist’s isolation, which sets up an important conflict. Conchobor, under the influence of Ruadan, wants the covenant to distance itself from all forms of Hermetic contact. He is likely to become a significant antagonist in such stories. The Cailleach, if she is to repair the</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>Covenant Finances The covenant, at present, costs more to run than the income it generates as it has an income of 80 Mythic Pounds per year but is currently spending 84 ½ Mythic Pounds across the same period. The largest cost by far is for the Hermetic laboratories maintained by the magi. In particular, Lugh’s laboratory represents the biggest draw on the covenant’s coffers. The expenditure in Mythic Pounds breaks down as follows:</div>
<div>Expenditure  Base Cost Reduction Total Buildings  8  0  8 Consumables 16  –3  13 Laboratories  44 ½  0  44 ½ Tithes  0  0  0 Wages  16  0  16 Weapons and Armor 1  –1  0 Writing Materials 7  –4  3 Total      84 ½</div>
<div>The cost of the weapons and armor includes all in use by the current grogs and their captain and a further six sets of basic equipment in the stores. There is enough wealth already at the covenant to mask the shortfall, as has been done for several years. To anyone taking a closer look at the finances however, the situation becomes obvious. There are things that can be done. An additional source of income could be secured, which may mean the magi venturing out into the world to find opportunities. Alternatively, the excessive amount spent on laboratories could be curtailed, although this would first need to be agreed by Lugh. Lastly, the covenant could employ  craftsmen to provision the laboratories, such as glass-blowers and silversmiths, bring stonemasons and builders to the covenant, or start brewing its own ale again under a master brewer; all of these provide significant cost reductions and make the covenant more self-reliant. The cost, of course, is that the covenant gives up some of its isolation. More on covenant wealth can be found in Covenants, chapter five.</div>

<h3>Loyalty</h3>

<div>The covenfolk are currently surprisingly loyal, with a Prevailing Loyalty value of 0. Using the rules on age 36 of Covenants, we get a base loyalty of –42.5 based on the Gifts of the member magi, which is modified to zero as the covenant has been around for so long and the covenfolk have grown up around their influence. The only one of the three mundane offices that have been filled is that of the Turb Captain and he provides a +5 bonus. The covenant has a zero Living Conditions bonus for covenfolk, however, as the covenant is particularly austere it does impose a –1 penalty. This gives a total of 4 loyalty points, which is not quite enough to buy a Loyalty Score of one.</div>
<div>Base Loyalty  –42.5 Modifier Covenant Age	 +42.5 Turb Captain  +5 Living Conditions +0 Austerity  –1 Total  +4</div>
<div>Furthermore, zero is simply the prevailing loyalty. Across numerous interactions with Lugh and Conchobor, not to mention the younger magi, the covenfolk may find themselves ignored or abused, each of which reduces their loyalty. In order to reverse this trend, the covenant can employ a steward and a chamberlain, both of whom help to improve the prevailing loyalty.</div>

<div>bronze man, needs to find a Verditius master to teach her the mystery of automatons and for that she needs to venture outside of Longmist. Eochaid can see little value in the persistent adherence to the rule and may challenge the control the covenant has over what they study and even how they conduct themselves. These stories arise from the Seclusion and Superiors Hooks.</div>
<div>Expelling Foreign Magi from Hibernia</div>
<div>There are those within Longmist who see Hibernia as subject to Hermetic invasion. Longmist could return as a beacon for all like-minded Hibernian magi, but forming a consensus among the magi may be difficult. Attracting the right allies and determining strategy would also be a challenge, as would taking the matter to Tribunal or even further. Lugh becomes the driver for these stories if he ever decides to distribute his books, and each of the younger magi must decide where he stands. Stories can also be sparked by the encroachment of foreign magi on lands Longmist considers its own, particularly their vis sources. The influx of foreign magi over the last fifty years means different things for each of the younger magi. For Dara and Mícheál they may represent a threat to the traditions they have grown up with, but for Eochaid and The Cailleach they may represent new opportunities for freedom and learning. These stories arise from the covenant’s Fractured Council and also the Seclusion Hook.</div>

<h3>Longmist as a Background Covenant</h3>

<div>Magi within Hibernia may wonder what has happened to the covenant of Longmist. While Redcaps report being received politely, the covenant has not attended Tribunal in any meaningful way for many years. The player magi could be tasked with investigating Longmist to determine the cause of this withdrawal and to see what can be done to bring them back.</div>
<div>The nomadic Clan mac Tire may approach the player covenant to gain allies in a raid on Longmist designed to retrieve its Cathach, the pelt of the Bjornaer magus Ualgrimm, with a promise of a share of the spoils. Longmist may seek aid in recapturing its Cathach, in which case the player covenant can negotiate its price before tracking the Clan mac Tire across Ulaid, a hunt that may even take them into Connacht. As a silent voice within the Tribunal, Longmist’s six votes may be turned toward any political aim supported by the player magi. Engaging with the covenant and persuading them of the merits of the argument is one potential storyline. On the other hand, Lugh’s extensive and polemic work on Hibernia’s future may see publication. The books are divisive and serve only to drive conflict across the Tribunal. Longmist may be approached by both sides of the argument, either to disrupt the flow of books or to ensure their publication. The elder magus Lugh fears that his end is near and he is willing to exchange the wealth of the covenant for as many new volumes in Magic Theory as he can so that he may increase his ability to renew his Longevity Ritual. Such a bargain may be made secretly through the Redcaps, which could create conflict with the other magi of the covenant. And of course, as an old covenant, Longmist already holds some unique magical devices. Troupes may also add any others that their sagas need, and the withdrawn magi of Longmist make a challenging barrier to acquiring such devices.</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Moving Longmist to Other Tribunals</h3>

<div>Longmist is located in the northeast of Hibernia, in the land of the Ulaidh, but with a little work the covenant can be moved to another Tribunal. The central themes discussed at the start of this chapter can also be adapted. For instance, the division within the covenant between embracing the outsiders and preparing for conflict with them can be replaced with both sides of the Harmonist-Wilderist debate prevalent in the Rhine. Their isolation may come from relocating the covenant to the cold Alpine mountains, or to the Holy Land. The Cathach has a particular importance in Hibernia, but even in other Tribunals, the retention of the pelt of a slain Bjornaer magus is a provocative act. Those who consider themselves Ualgrimm’s descendants still want to avenge this insult and still work toward reclaiming the trophy, either through their own powers or through allies.</div>

<h1>Chapter Six Collem Leonis</h1>


<div sidebars>
<div>Collem Leonis is a Second Spring covenant in the Rhine Tribunal. Its foundation dates back to the early years of the Order and it has recently moved full circle to rebirth from a dying Winter situation. It is home to four young magi and a single remaining maga from the older generation. They reside in a stone manor house in the forested hills of Sauerland, relatively close to Dortmund and Cologne. The magi are involved in researching the regiones linking the area to Scandinavia, in dealing with growing mundane expansion and trade in the Rhineland, and in consolidating the resources and relations of the old covenant.</div>

<h3>History</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis was founded in the year 865, soon after the regional Tribunal borders were drawn up. At that time it was the eighth covenant of the newly named Rhine Tribunal, but only four of these covenants still exist in 1220: Durenmar, Crintera, Irencillia, and Collem Leonis. In the late 850s two Bjornaer magi — Wolfgang and Adler — were led to this place of supernatural power by a Great Beast — a lion. They also found an abundance of supernatural beings foreign to Germany, which they eventually linked to the seemingly random opening of regiones. Together with a Tremere assessor and a knightly Flambeau they formed the covenant without facing significant political resistance. The Bjornaer magi focused on protecting the wild and formed a naturalistic and introvert faction. At this time, the land was owned by a Waldgraf, a German term for a lesser count who typically rules a wild and sparsely inhabited area. The covenant’s chief diplomats, Pamprepius of Flambeau and Tacitus of Tremere, reached a mutually beneficial agreement</div>
<div>whereby the forested hills were designated as hunting grounds, the covenant keep named as hunting lodge for the Waldgraf, and the closest manor given formal control over the entire area, with the silent agreement that the “wise ones” were allowed a great deal of independence. Over the years the lands and rulers changed, and the diplomatic envoys of Collem Leonis had to repeatedly re-establish the original status and rights. As the presence of magical beasts and regio openings were studied, the uncontrolled portal became one of Collem Leonis’ most distinctive features. There was a Nordic aspect to all the creatures, and the research and exploration of this phenomenon became an ongoing project for generations of magi. It drew in a pair of Bonisagi: Amadeus was a researcher, Briana a politician. As they both joined the covenant in its infancy they are considered founding magi as well, as noted in the charter. During this time, significant resources of both mundane and magical nature were found in the hills. Reluctant to set up a major operation the covenant only mined sporadically for</div>
<div>lead, silver, and iron. In its prime, manufactured goods made of metals and leather were produced on site and sold in Dortmund. Being in a safe and secluded location with good mundane relations and comfortable monetary and magical resources, Collem Leonis moved rapidly through the Spring season and into Summer. Subsequent generations of magi lacked the pioneering spirit of cooperation; they focused more on personal goals than on the common good. The period also saw the rise of several new covenants in the Rhine gorge as well as their eventual fall, with negligible interference from Collem Leonis’ magi. At the turn of the millennium Autumn approached, and the Schism War was the covenant’s first major crisis. The Bjornaer magi retreated to Crintera, not to return until the matter was resolved. The Flambeau joined the battle, and not all returned. Despite this, Collem Leonis managed to survive. Even though there were fewer members, each individual was more powerful than before, and if they were less politically active, few dared act against them. In the 1150s, the Tremere started to focus on Dortmund and established a permanent presence. During this time, the settlement grew into a town due to the prolonged stay of Frederick Barbarossa and his subsequent rebuilding of the town after a great fire. This growth culminated in 1220 with Dortmund becoming a Free Imperial City. Evil tongues claimed the Tremere played an active part, but they naturally refused to admit any complicity, and only personal disagreements arose. No serious cases have yet been taken to Tribunal. Toward the end of the 12th century, Collem Leonis was seen by outsiders as entering Winter, but the dwindling number of resident magi did not realize this until later. When they did, they worked arduously, but to no avail, to push back to Autumn, and several of them simply gave up and relocated. Those who remained represented Houses Bonisagus, Bjornaer, Flambeau, and Tremere,</div>

<div>and they agreed to train one last generation of apprentices and then leave those youngsters the reins. Ferra never took an apprentice, as she entered a long Twilight episode soon after the plan was set in motion. As the apprentices approached their respective gauntlets, the old magi saw a major threat building up from the portal: a known Norse lindorm had grown large enough to dare attack. After his filius Tiberius swore the Code, the ever-valiant Scipio entered the portal for one glorious last stand, never to be heard from again. As the feared attack of the lindorm failed to come, he was credited</div>
<div>with success. Freki’s mater Oda retired to Crintera, but she occasionally lets her displeasure be known. Baliana’s pater Marcellus took to the roads, but spends the colder parts of the year in Durenmar. Julia’s pater Renardus retired to Coeris. Upon returning from Twilight Ferra decided to stay on at Collem Leonis in a purely advisory capacity to live out her final years. The young generation took on the challenge of taking over a degenerating ruin, hoping that the decaying shell hid gems of old lore and power. As the Tribunal of 1221 approaches, they hope to suffer little political interference or resis</div>
<div>tance, allowing them to concentrate on rebuilding, finding the old resources, and consolidating the power of the once-proud Collem Leonis covenant of Sauerland. They need to find their niche in the internal politics of their centuriesold covenant, and learn to live with the single old and powerful magus who wants to mold his successors according to a strategy planned without the participation of the new generation.</div>

<h3>Boons & Hooks</h3>

<div>The Boons reflect a unique and powerful location, and the history and traditions that bind the community together. The Second Spring situation is reflected by resources temporarily lost, recoverable over time and through stories. The Hooks cover the supernatural aspects as well as the proximity to a mundane lord and a bustling city, in terms of both physical distance and close relations. Details of the Boons and Hooks are found in Covenants. Tame Nobleman (Major Residents Boon): The magi have had an arrangement</div>

<div>with the local vassal to the Count of Mark since the emergence of the Berg-Althena dynasty. In 1220 this is Herr Vorderhagen, and his family has possessed the lands for two generations. While Herr Vorderhagen is the formal lord, the lands are so vast and wild that the magi have fairly free rein away from the settled areas. Hidden Resources (Minor Resources Boon, selected four times): Several different setbacks during the failing Winter years led to a lot of Collem Leonis’ important, magical resources being destroyed, lost, or removed. Throughout the chapter can be found Story Seeds for inspiration to rediscovering portions of these, totaling 1000 Build Points Manor Hall (Free Buildings Boon): The primary building of Collem Leonis is an old but well-built rectangular manor hall with thick walls and few entrances. Aura (Minor Site Boon, selected twice): The wild, forested hills of Sauerland have been untouched by mundanes for centuries, creating a Magic aura of 5 at the covenant site. Strong Community (Minor Residents Boon): Many covenfolk have worked and lived at Collem Leonis for generations, and others are recruited from the locale. The covenant has protected them from war, sickness, hard winters, and hunger, and they have stood together in hard times, winning glory alongside the magi. This makes it more difficult for outside agencies to infiltrate and spy, which considering the recent re-emergence from isolation into Hermetic society would otherwise be a risk. Chase (Minor Surroundings Boon): The covenant has the right to hunt game, gather resources, and fell trees in an area defined as the special hunting grounds of the Count in the wild, forested hills. For the time being! This agreement is very loose and good relations with Herr Vorderhagen need to be maintained. City (Major Surroundings Hook): Originally, the relative closeness to Dortmund was not an issue, but the town’s explosive growth during the latter half of the 12th century resulted in the city becoming a force to be reckoned with. The beneficial effects of increased availability of high quality manufactured goods, information, and even exotic items may become overshadowed by growing guild influence and expansion into the wild areas. Julia of Tremere must work diligently and use her connections to offset these challenges. However, her deep involvement through personal contacts as well</div>
<div>as through her extended, mundane family means she risks exposure and possible charges of meddling with mundanes. Mundane Politics (Major External Relations Hook): Relations and politics prove an eternal challenge for the sociable magi, having to deal with mundane nobility, church, and guildmasters from chartered towns. The area is a hotbed of warmongering and political maneuvering between the Counts of Mark and Berg, who both know of the magi and want to use them. As yet no breaches of the Code have ever been proven, although the upcoming Tribunal may change this. Ideas for storylines are found in the section The Covenant in Play, later. Uncontrolled Portal (Minor Site Hook, selected twice): Seemingly random places in the heavily forested hills and valleys open up to Magical or Faerie regiones without warning and with no discernible pattern. Through these portals come Nordic supernatural creatures, as well as other inexplicable events such as unnatural weather phenomena. These portals are covered in more detail in the section Covenant Buildings later, while sample storylines are found in the section The Covenant in Play. Rights and Customs (Minor Residents Hook): Over the many years of Collem Leonis’ existence a good number of local holidays and periodic feasts have become part of daily life. These are now are believed to be unbreakable rules. Old wordings allow a set number of covenfolk, from when the covenant was much larger, to be free from work obligations on specific days. These customs must be honored by the magi or risk severe loyalty issues, even though the dwindling number of servants means that on some days virtually no covenfolk are at work. Suffrage (Minor Residents Hook): It is not unusual for Hermetic magi to consider the two genders equal, and Collem Leonis took this a step further when founding maga Briana ensured equal rights for women were entered into the charter of the covenant. Visitors and outside relations are puzzled by this structure, and if the Church were to investigate this would be considered sinful. Vis Salary (Minor resources Hook): In accordance with the charter of Collem Leonis the members must adhere to a strict hierarchy and more importantly provide services in order to receive their bi-annual vis grant from the resources owned by the covenant. Since the council has a great deal of freedom to interpret the guidelines in the charter to determine which activities are regarded as</div>
<div>services eligible for payment there is a significant advantage to be had from finding a lucrative niche or services to provide.</div>

<h3>Magi</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis is home to only five magi: four young magi and one from the old generation. The descriptions of the magi refer to specific terms from the Rhine Tribunal, namely ranks and gilds, which are described in brief here. Rhine magi are divided into formal ranks including journeyman, master, and archmage. The latter two enjoy special benefits when settling disputes or voting at Tribunal. The gilds are organizations that magi may belong to based on interests rather than House or covenant affiliation. The gilds of the magi of Collem Leonis include the Oak Gild, seeking to preserve the greatness of old and effectively maintain a status quo; the Ash Gild, who are aggressive and outgoing; the Hawthorne Gild, wishing to preserve wild areas; and the Apple Gild, seeking peaceful integration with mundane society. For more detail see Guardians of the Forests: The Rhine Tribunal, pages 27–29.</div>

<h3>Ferra of Bonisagus</h3>

<div>This 109-year-old maga is the single remaining representative of the previous generation, and a direct Hermetic descendant of the founding magus Amadeus of Bonisagus. Originally an elementalist with a strong preference for Terram, her expertise in this area this was occasionally utilized for extracting ores and metals from the mine in the hills. However, her youthful and highly experimental years and use of powerful magic brought her through one Twilight after another, and ended up giving her insight into and skills concerning the spirits of the dead. Most of her remaining career was spent in pursuit of this endeavor. Her divided specialty and goals left her with less Acclaim and success than her potential suggests. She has written and submitted many texts, trained several apprentices, invested a talisman, and bonded with an owl familiar. This was more than enough to attain the rank of master, but she never pursued the rank of archmage. Her risk-taking nature resulted in her suffering from the Flaw Twilight Prone after a particularly severe Twilight episode lasting seven years, which also killed her familiar and destroyed her talisman. When she finally</div>

<div>New Spells:</div>
<div>Voices from Hollow Spaces ReMe 25 R: Voice, D: Ring, T: Individual. This spell is found in Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, page 140. It binds a ghost — which needs to be present or have been summoned previously — to a place or portable object. The necromancer needs other ways to convince or compel the ghost to subsequently do his bidding. (Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Ring)</div>
<div>Day of Communion MuVi Gen R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group. This spell is a Wizard’s Communion as found in ArM5, page 160, but with a longer duration. In accordance with the errata for Muto Vim such spells need a duration at least as long as the casting of the target spell. As Rituals as minimum are level 20 and take 15 minutes per magnitude to cast, a Muto Vim spell needs to last one hour or more, making Duration: Concentration impractical. All the magi in the group must add together the (level–2 magnitudes) of the Day of Communion they are casting. This number must exceed twice the level of the specified ritual being cast. As no more than one magus may join the group for each magnitude of the ritual being cast, this means that this spell is largely useless below level 20. It is highly useful for casting an efficient Aegis of the Hearth, which is no exception to the rule that all spells directly affecting targets must Penetrate. (Base effect, with two magnitudes devoted to the Duration.)</div>
<div>Appearance: Ferra has a kind face with pale skin, a wrinkled forehead and neat, short hair turning from gray to white. Under thick eyebrows her eyes, which are starting to go cloudy from cataracts, often flash with excitement when hearing of an initiative or when getting an idea. Her once strong back is starting to curve and her sinewy limbs feel the winter’s chill more often than not.</div>

<h3>Dominator of Ghosts</h3>

<div>The Dominator is an invested device in the form of a sturdy yew staff set with pieces of human skull and a green turquoise. Ferra prepared it as a compound device with 15 pawns of vis for the turquoise, but currently only a single effect has been invested, taking up 5 pawns of space.</div>
<div>Coerce the Spirits of the Night</div>
<div>ReMe 44 Pen 30, 12/day R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind Effect is that of the spell of the same name, found in ArM5, page 152. Activated by pointing at the intended target while twisting it clockwise and saying “I dominate”. (Effect: Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc; Modifications +4 uses/day +5 item maintains concentration; +15 Penetration)</div>

<div>returned, she found her covenant a decaying ruin with only a few of the most loyal covenfolk remaining. Her remaining sodales were well underway with the training of a new generation to take over Collem Leonis, and she took it upon herself to stay on and grant the youngsters the benefits of her wisdom. In 1220 Ferra fills an advisory position; she is wary of using magic for fear of Final Twilight. The death of her familiar was hard on her, even more so than seeing her covenant on the verge of collapse and her lifelong friends and sodales gone. As the senior maga she has the status of Älderman in the Council, but she uses none of her privileges or powers. Instead, she sits quietly listening or daydreaming, enjoying the energy of the young generation. Occasionally, she offers unsolicited advice or ideas of varying relevance. Her memory is failing, and she often mistakes</div>
<div>one of the young magi for someone called Heinrich, or he will say that she knew a Heinrich who did this or knew that. No one has ever been able to find out who Heinrich was, or even if he ever existed outside Ferra’s mind. Ferra is stoically preparing for her end, however it may come.</div>

<h3>Baliana of Bonisagus</h3>

<div>Baliana was Gauntleted in 1218, having been trained in equal parts at Collem Leonis, Durenmar, and on the roads of Rhine Tribunal and the southern coast of Norway. Her pater Marcellus — a direct descendant of founding maga Briana — has a life-long project of travel and research in order to record the magical powers of non-Hermetics along the northern borders of civilization. Marcellus gained</div>
<div>the exotic Supernatural Ability of Comprehend Magic through a lifetime of risk-filled research, And although this Ability is more often associated with the Line of Pralix from House Ex Miscellanea, he introduced it into his Bonisagus lineage, accepting the risk to his reputation. Being a renowned teacher, he ensured that Baliana mastered both Hermetic magic and Comprehend Magic. Marcellus worked a great deal with Occultes of Bonisagus, who in 1220 is the former librarian of Durenmar, and has an interest in integrating non-Hermetic hedge wizardry. His ambition is to once and for all to find, investigate, and understand the Order of Odin and the infamous rune wizards, or help fight them if need be. As this was somewhat compatible with the more peaceful goals of Marcellus, Baliana was fostered by him for a while. Occultes’ own filius Pancrestis, from the new covenant of Heorot, has been trained in Magic Theory for investigating and possibly integrating the Nordic traditions, but it seems that he does not have the courage to do field work, and Baliana can help with this. The special attention of Occultes led Baliana to feel obliged to cooperate with the political plots of her Bonisagus mentors. This in turn resulted in her joining the Ash Gild — a choice unorthodox or even controversial for her House. By associating with the Ash Gild, Baliana can learn about the organization and capabilities of the Order of Odin. For this endeavor Baliana needs to be powerful, resourceful, and with a broad repertoire of magic. The principles of her mission are simple, but the details of how she is to attain her goals are not. Collem Leonis’ portal is the major focus of her attention at present, due to the Nordic connection, and she is furthering relations with Pancrestius of Heorot beyond the superficial introduction from Occultes. The snag is, however, that Collem Leonis currently has little immediate power but plenty of potential, which it will take time to harness. At present Baliana’s project is in its infancy. No details have been decided, and it is kept secret due to the general attitude at Durenmar. Baliana intends to focus on the magic needed for her travels and research, and to study Vim as well, so once she learns about exotic magic she may ward against it or unravel its effects. Learning the rune alphabet is also a priority of hers. In Collem Leonis she is a member of the Ruling Council in the Seat of the Governor, the position responsible for the internal governance of the covenant and its resources.</div>

<h3>Freki of Bjornaer</h3>

<div>Freki of House Bjornaer traces her line straight back to founding magus Wolfgang. Her Heartbeast is a wolf and she is an active member of Clan Arelie. Freki’s mater, Oda, found her at age seven roaming the hills of Sauerland. The girl was born and raised in Norway and is believed to have wandered inadvertently through one of the portals. After only four years of apprenticeship she attended the Gathering of the Twelve Years in 1203. She chose the name Freki from the old stories about Odin’s wolves told to her by her grandmother when she was a small child. After Gauntlet she was pressured by Oda into taking more risks than she thought necessary, the result of which was a lot of Twilight episodes, although most resulted in beneficial effects, making her stronger. She is not nor will she ever be the kind of fighter Oda is and many in their line were. Her wolf Heartbeast is the perfect predator and hunter though, and Freki works with these qualities instead. Where Oda seeks to find and destroy the enemies of old to better defend the sacred sites, Freki has a different approach. She has been touched by the current plight of his House and wishes to use her magical senses to differentiate between enemies who must be vanquished and those few individual hedge wizards or parallel traditions that can be assimilated by the House. As Birna herself came from a tradition of Pomeranian Witches, Freki has the theory that similar traditions exist in the northern lands, which is why she became interested in the portals in the first place. Freki wishes to become the leading authority on differentiating between different kinds of shapeshifters. Allied with Baliana, who has compatible goals, she intends to find the Order of Odin. She has ambitions of surpassing her cruel mater, hoping this will finally make her accept her methods and stop harassing her. Her magic is strongest in her wolf form, and she spends most of her time this way, intending to train her innate animal abilities to hunt. She has a great focus on practicing things herself, relying on vis studies, or alternating between offering training to his Sept and being trained by its members. Her continued magical focus is on Intellego and on greatly expanding her repertoire of scent-based spells, as she finds using the other senses crude and unreliable. Unfortunately, these need to be original spells of her own invention, which complicates the matter. At Collem Leonis, Freki presides over the Seat of the Predator on the council and is</div>
<div>tasked with keeping her eye on the area and serving as tracker during hunts.</div>

<h3>Tiberius of Flambeau</h3>

<div>Tiberius started his life as Meitzler of Soest, youngest son of Freiherr Reinhart of Soest, at an estate east of Dortmund. His pater, Scipio, recruited the boy at his home manor, effectively rescuing Meitzler from the usual fate of a youngest son of a knight — a monastery. Sadly, the boy’s insistence on leaving his family for an unconventional life was resented by his father. As ties to the family were severed, Scipio immediately rid the boy of his vulgar name and named him Tiberius. His mundane family’s enemies of</div>
<div>ten seek to take their grievances out on him since he no longer enjoys any protection from them; see the section External Relations later for more detail. Even though it is difficult at times, Tiberius has prevailed and grown stronger in the process. Tiberius and his pater Scipio follow the Flambeau school of Ramius, focusing on knightly ways and melee combat. Trained at Collem Leonis as well as in noble courts, Tiberius is as comfortable dealing with magi as he is with knights and lords. Since Pamprepius founded this line, their apprentices have been recruited from among the lesser sons of knights and nobles, valuing martial skills and a Gentle Gift equally. Like his pater before him Tiberius holds the Seat of the Armiger: he is in charge of the defenses as well as the fighting turb. The</div>

<div>badge of office is the greatspear originally created by Pamprepius as his talisman. Even though most of the effects were personal to Pamprepius himself, the few still useable powers make it worthwhile. Because of the status of the hall keep as the count’s hunting lodge, Tiberius also plays the part of the knight in charge of hunting. His fighting skills as well as his general interest is invaluable in the hunting parties, which are vital for the covenant’s provisions, finances, and vis income, as well as their social relations with their lord. Like many other Flambeau, Tiberius is actively involved with the Ash Gild and feels a strong loyalty to his brothers-in-arms. He protects the weak, the innocent, and the fabric of the Order against enemies, be they external or sodales fallen from grace. He even feels this kind of loyalty toward his vulgar family, in spite of them disinheriting him. In battle he prefers a fair but challenging fight, using magic to help as necessary or to even the odds in melee. Tiberius gladly steps up to help a fellow magus by offering protection or offensive capabilities for a good cause. Rumors at Collem Leonis suggest that Tiberius is the father of Erika, the 13-year-old tomboy daughter of the covenant’s autocrat Johanna. This is true, and Tiberius works hard to maintain a good relationship with his family, which is somewhat difficult because of his frequent and long absences. His time spent with Erika is mainly used for weapons training, since this is a passion they hold in common. Tiberius thinks she may be Gifted, and as this has not manifested itself yet he also hopes she is Gently Gifted. While it would be easy enough to have Freki check, Tiberius has been putting this off. If Erika is Gifted, she should be trained, but the Rhine Tribunal believes that journeymen should not train apprentices, and she would likely be too old before he could become a master. Further, the tradition of his line dictates that he should train a younger son of the nobility, not a bastard daughter of a covenant official. Finally, the girl may not even want to train for magic; she has an obvious preference for fighting, has learned little Latin, and does not seem like the bookish type. Rather than face these problems, Tiberius prefers not to know for certain.</div>

<h3>Julia of Tremere</h3>

<div>Julia’s pater Renardus was deeply involved as a trader and townsman in the growing settlement of Dortmund, as his lineage of Tremere magi had been since the founding of the covenant. Dortmund was rebuilt in 1152 after a</div>
<div>devastating fire, and the extended residency of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa himself led the city to grow significantly in size, and attracted in a great deal of business in the form of trade and crafts. In 1220 the status as Free Imperial City became a reality, and Renardus was credited in his House as one of the architects of this endeavor. The truth is most likely less grand, but there is no denying that the lineage of Tremere in Dortmund did play a part in the process. Renardus found the orphaned girl Julia in a Rhineland village and fostered her with a family running a merchant business he owned in Dortmund. Julia was raised by this family as their own, along with their own children,</div>
<div>until she began her apprenticeship. Once his filia had sworn the oath Renardus retired to Coeris. Julia focused on taking his place as controller of a trading house, in the trading guilds, and among the burghers. Being a woman complicates this, and Julia sometimes wonders whether it might not be easier to use magic to pretend to be a man. The business had previously sold some manufactured items made from the various metals from the hills and crafted in the workshops at Collem Leonis, but nothing is produced there anymore. After the recent stagnation, the business concentrates on wares brought in by her foster brother Armund and</div>

</div sidebars>


<div sidebars>
<div>sold or exported by her foster father, Frederick. Julia herself takes care of networking, socializing, and keeping an eye on her rivals, competitors, and the mundane authorities in general. With some work this business could eventually once again support not only Julia and her foster family comfortably, but also contribute to the income of Collem Leonis itself. Erich the spy — a companion character — is in the employ of Julia, who buys information from him on a regular basis and often has special assignments for him. Julia serves her House as an assessor, monitoring mundane activities and plans for transportation and provisions should the Tremere mobilize in her locale. Her local knowledge, connections, Gentle Gift, and resourceful ways of using subtle mind-altering magics make her invaluable to the covenant. Naturally, she holds the Seat of the Ambassador in the covenant’s council, with social relations as her area of responsibility. One of the few things that can get her temper rising is having to clean up other people’s indiscreet problems, especially those of her sodales. Discretion and delicacy is her livelihood, and she goes to great lengths to lecture her more hands-on covenant mates about this. Julia’s sigil is administered by Archmage Stentorius of Fengheld, the exarch for the Rhine Tribunal.</div>

<h3>Notable Covenfolk</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis has the base complement mentioned in Covenants of a single grog and two servants for each magus. The few remaining covenfolk include some exceptional and loyal individuals. The two specialists, Johanna the autocrat and Francois the acting turb captain, are worth 17 Build Points in total.</div>

<h3>Companions</h3>

<div>The severely depleted personnel roster of Collem Leonis means that there are very few associated specialists and other individuals suitable as companion characters.</div>
<div>Johanna the Autocrat</div>
<div>Johanna is the steward, chamberlain, and in every way the manager of Collem Leonis, and a very independent woman indeed. As the</div>
<div>daughter of a lesser noble from the vicinity of Dortmund she had the privilege of an education with a private tutor from the cathedral school. However, this only left her wanting more and with a burning desire for freedom and independence. After crossing paths with Scipio of Flambeau — the pater of Tiberius — she ran away to Collem Leonis at the age of 15 to avoid the crushing yoke of being female in the feudal system. After briefly fearing that this would be the crisis that destroyed the covenant, the magi managed to negotiate an uneasy settlement, and the girl was taken under the tutelage of Joachim, the autocrat at the time. Her first years were very turbulent, as she not only had to learn the ropes of managing a covenant, and what kind of people magi were and what they did, but also bore a child by a father unknown. Everyone thinks (correctly) that Tiberius is the father, as the two always had a friendly relationship. Nothing has ever been confirmed nor denied, and no one ever gave the matter much attention, assuming that they already knew the story. After only a few years she was thrust without warning into leadership when Joachim suddenly disappeared, along with a great deal of books and magical resources. Naturally, Joachim’s legacy was marred by this crooked end, and to the present day this mystery has not been solved (see the Story Seed: Sins of the Predecessor, later). Johanna’s daughter, Erika, grew up in this strange place, heavily</div>
<div>influenced by the supernatural. Though not of her mother’s scholarly disposition, she shares her tendencies toward freedom and equality between the genders. For game statistics use the Female Scholar template found in ArM5, page 22 with the following changes: Increase age to 31, add Profession: Chamberlain 4 (inspire loyalty), Profession: Steward 4 (mediating), Area Lore: Sauerland 4 (geography), Organization Lore: Covenant of Collem Leonis 4 (history), and spread the remaining 130 experience points as desired on key abilities, or on adding Organization Lore: Order of Hermes, Realm Lores, or even Code of Hermes.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The Dark Magus</h3>

<div>Ruprecht was a cover used by Imanitos Mendax of Jerbiton, who for the purposes of this seed is assumed to be a dark magus: see Guardians of the Forest, pages 72–74. Imanitos had, many years earlier, been orchestrating the corruption of the covenant’s former Autocrat Joachim and his grand theft from the library, as described under Hidden Resources, later. Imanitos failed to receive the stolen books, and he saw Erich as a way to spy indirectly on the magi of Collem Leonis, hoping to find the books again. Erich’s information was of no help at all, so Imanitos abandoned this project, for now. Although he still visits Dortmund and Cologne he now uses a different guise and identity, and bides his time before reactivating Erich as a spy. Imanitos was disguised using an Imaginem spell while interacting with Erich, and so assumes that his identity is safe. However, Erich’s Second Sight saw through the illusion, and thus Erich would recognize Imanitos as “Ruprecht” were he to meet the magus.</div>

<h3>Erich the Spy</h3>

Discreet clothing. Heavy hooded cloak. Encumbrance: 0 Appearance: Although well-versed in hiding behind his cloak and roaming in the dark hours, Erich’s goblin blood betrays him if he is seen up close. His skin has a green-grayish tint, his facial features are too sharp to be completely natural and human, and his eyes have a faint yellow glow in the dark.</div>
</div sidebars>


<div sidebars>
<div>Erich the Spy</div>
<div>Erich grew up in the shadows of Dortmund; his goblin blood made him ill-favored by humanity and adept at shady activities. In his youth he quickly realized that while stealing was easy for him, it was risky business and in the long run merely a shortcut to a life as a one-handed beggar or a swing on the gallows. Instead, he focused on using his sharp senses from places of concealment to learn secrets which could be sold to a growing market of customers in the rapidly expanding trading town. The spy is in possession of invisible information and does not risk getting caught, like a thief with stolen goods. Of course, trespassing can also be a crime, so care must be taken. Years of practice and an instinct to ask the right informants made Erich into a proficient spy. He does not rely on being known but instead approaches likely buyers once he learns potentially valuable secrets. Eventually he made contact with Renardus of Tremere, and a profitable professional relationship began. Erich was loath to commit to only one employer and thus continues as a freelance agent, but admittedly most of his work is done for Renardus and his successor Julia. A few years ago as he was setting up business in Cologne his Second Sight revealed an invisible person. This led him to discover diabolists establishing a coven, which he initially saw as a business opportunity his meddlesome nature could not leave alone. In time the nature of demons and their worshipers began to terrify Erich, and he wanted to back out before succumbing to demonic temptation. However, as many members were powerful authority figures his business in the city was doomed. From that point on he has avoided Cologne like the plague, and keeps his knowledge a secret for fear of being sent back to unravel the organization. Unfortunately, this did not keep him out of trouble. A merchant going by the name of Ruprecht, who participated in the diabolic rites, noticed Erich spying, and confronted him in Dortmund later. Ruprecht had obvious supernatural powers and detailed knowledge of the Collem Leonis and the magi, and he intimidated Erich into spying on them. Erich never supplied important information, and after a few months Ruprecht stopped showing up, but Erich lives on in constant fear of his return or some disaster befalling the covenant brought on by his spying.</div>

<h3>Grogs</h3>

<div>The turb consists of a modest five fighting grogs led reluctantly by Francois the greatswordman, and including the seasoned sentry Paul. This group is augmented by the bows of a few huntsmen like Geri.</div>
<div>Francois the Grog Captain</div>
<div>Francois was brought to Collem Leonis from Normandy by Tiberius only a few years ago, and still struggles with the local language. He is a specialist fighter and has picked up enough leadership skills to serve adequately as a sergeant. However, the shortage of manpower led to his promotion to Grog Captain. For stats use the Specialist template on ArM5, page 21 except switch Single Weapon for Great Weapon (greatsword), switch Bargain for Leadership, and add High German 3 (grogs), with experience points gained from raising his age to 20.</div>
<div>Geri the Hunter</div>
<div>Geri is a local lad, quiet to the point of being sullen and with a dark view on life. What sets him apart form other hunters is that he possesses Second Sight, but this is kept mostly a secret as such a thing usually causes fear in others or raises suspicions. Use the Hunter template on ArM5, page 21 with the following changes: Add Afflicted Tongue, add Second Sight, and raise age by at least one year to improve the ability.</div>

<h3>Paul the Spearman</h3>

<div>Paul has served Collem Leonis for quite a few years and is the sort of archetypal grog who seems to always be on watch when something odd happens or an important visitor arrives. There is also a tendency for him to always accompany the magi on those expeditions which turn out to be sufficiently dramatic to be remembered afterward. He is a skilled fighter and an even more apt sentry, with the endurance and discipline to stay awake and fully alert all night long.</div>
<div>The Rest of the Turb</div>
<div>Statistics for the remaining grogs can be taken from the templates in ArM5, page 21, or Grogs, pages 87–143. The latest potential recruit is the feisty, redheaded tomboy Erika, 13-year-old daughter of Johanna the Autocrat, who enjoys roughing it and fighting, and certainly has a flair for it.</div>

<h3>Paul the Spearman</h3>

<div>Characteristics: Int –1, Per +2, Pre 0, Com –1, Str +1, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik +1 Size: 0 Age: 32 (32) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 Virtues and Flaws: Turb Trained, Enduring Constitution, Keen Eyes; Carefree, Lingering Injury, No Sense of Direction New Virtues & Flaws: Turb Trained: This Minor Social Status Virtue is featured in Grogs, page 76. It grants access to Martial Abilities as well as a single Dead Language which the magi at the covenant speak. Lingering Injury: This Minor General Flaw is featured in Grogs, page 81. An old injury has not healed properly, resulting in a permanent –1 penalty to strenuous physical activities. A botch on these activities aggravates the injury to –3 penalty, and recovery is as for a Light Wound.

He looks fit, perceptive, and disciplined. His left arm is often bandaged or set in a sling, forcing him to perform most tasks one handed.</div>
</div sidebars>


<h3>Specialists and Other Covenfolk</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis has only the base complement for a covenant of two servants or laborers per magus. Julia’s house in Dortmund has two of these in the form of her foster parents; the remaining eight are a mixture of teamsters, stablehands, maids, and kitchen staff, as well as Ferra’s personal servant Otto, who keeps her lab clean.</div>

<h3>Covenant Organization</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis is organized in accordance with and ruled by the charters thoroughly drawn up at the time of founding. Nothing has been altered since the first decade of the covenant’s existence.</div>

<h3>Hierarchy and Governance</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis has a highly hierarchical structure with several ranks for the magi, a remnant of the time with more members from different generations. These days the structure seems not only archaic but also needlessly complex. However, the rules need to be followed, and provisions for changing the rules require a certain degree of cooperation and agreement between the council members. In many ways Collem Leonis is closer to a meritocracy than a gerontocracy, as members must perform services for privileges, and age only matters for a single council seat.</div>
<div>Income and Supplies</div>
<div>Collem Leonis has rights to utilize any resources within the border of the so-called hunting grounds, granted by the count of Mark. This includes hunting, gathering, and logging. This last is done only for construction purposes, since the Woodshed of Plenty detailed later covers all fuel requirements. The hills contain veins of many minerals, including iron, coal, lime, silver, bronze, tin, and lead in moderate quantities. The magi of olden days were reluctant to take advantage of this, since running a full-scale mining operation is indiscreet and risks triggering guild interven</div>
<div>tion. Metal was extracted by magic and according to need; Ferra was integral to this in her younger days. This could, with sufficient work and time, be turned into a profitable source of income, by way of either bringing in greatly increased manpower and expertise, or using magics dedicated to this venture. This is also a source of potential stories, see the Story Seed: The Mischievous Kobold later.</div>
<div>Study and Laboratory Work</div>
<div>While the library is only a pale remnant of the glory days of Collem Leonis, the new generation of magi may still find useful texts readily available, and in time many of the lost books can be recovered. The site has a strong aura which compensates for the lack of advanced labs available.</div>

<h3>Life at Collem Leonis</h3>

<div>Daily life for magi and covenfolk alike is peaceful and unchanging, the centuries of history and tradition covering everything like a heavy but comfortable blanket. However, now the new generation has taken over there are bound to be changes. Occasionally this quiet life is interrupted by supernatural events from the uncontrolled portals, upheaval and political turmoil in the mundane surroundings, or changes in the delicate guild structure of the constantly evolving city of Dortmund. The magi, however, govern themselves within the strict wording of the charter.</div>

<h3>The Charter</h3>

<div>The charter recognizes three levels of rank: haeres, prospectus, and visitator. Apprentices are given no formal rank and follow that of their parens as a courtesy. Haeres was originally the rank of the founding magi, and was subsequently extended mature magi who were judged worthy by the council. The haeres form the ruling council of the covenant. A prospectus is a younger maga in residence who has not yet established herself in the eyes of his superiors. It also covers haeres demoted to this rank for a transgression. Visitators are short term residents who do not qualify as peregrinatores, as defined by the Peripheral Code of the Rhine Tribunal.</div>
<div>Ruling Council and Seats</div>
<div>The haeres form the ruling council, and they alone vote in matters concerning the covenant, including promoting, demoting, or accepting members. The ruling council recognizes five seats, held for an entire cycle (as defined later) before the council may call for a vote to name another haeres to the position. A seat is given to the haeres most suitable for the position, with the best skills to fulfill her responsibilities. Any member may nominate a candidate, including himor herself. If several candidates apply the presiding Elder sets a suitable test to resolve the matter. No maga is ordinarily allowed more than one seat, and if a magus is most appropriate for several seats she chooses the one she prefers and a new round of nominations follow for the unoccupied seat or seats. If a seat can not be filled the Elder holds the responsibilities temporarily and may delegate work to nonhaeres. All seats other than the Elder are given on loan one of Collem Leonis’ magical artifacts, in order to form a link with the legacy of their predecessors: see Resources later.</div>
<div>• The Seat of the Elder goes to the senior haeres. The Elder’s responsibilities are: Acting as moderator of all council meetings, calling a vote when discussion has lasted a suitable amount of time, and overseeing the recording of all discussions and votes in the covenant chronicle by a scribe. She must always cast her vote, never abstain, and her vote is tie-breaking should the parties be deadlocked. • The Seat of the Governor goes to the haeres most suitable to govern the day to day business of the covenant. She holds the Circlet of the Governor as badge of office. • The Seat of the Armiger goes to the haeres most capable in combat in whatever form it may be, especially in the defense of the covenant. She holds the Spear of the Armiger as badge of office. • The Seat of the Predator goes to the haeres with the sharpest senses and best local knowledge to better keep an eye on Collem Leonis’ domain. She holds the Mask of the Predator as badge of office. • The Seat of the Diplomat goes to the haeres most skilled in social relations, especially those with the mundanes, in order to keep Collem Leonis safe, secret, and prosperous. She holds the Clasp of the Diplomat as badge of office.</div>
<div>Voting and Meetings</div>
<div>All issues are decided by a majority vote. Each haeres has one vote, and votes may be blank unless otherwise noted. The ruling council requires at least two thirds of the haeres to be present in order to be quorate. An amendment during the charter’s first year notes that changes to the charter need a two-thirds majority to pass. Regular council meetings are held on the morning of the first day of each season. Any haeres may call an emergency council meeting with due warning. This is deliberately not defined as a fixed time frame as it depends on the urgency of the issue. Any haeres may later raise the issue and complain about a given meeting not having been called with sufficient warning and ask to have a decision called to vote once more. The council may not take a vote to demote a haeres without her presence, unless they have informed her at least one season in advance, or done their very best to try to deliver such a message. A cycle is defined as a period of time lasting two full years or eight seasons. The count started in the spring of 858, before the covenant was even officially recognized, and thus the spring of 1220 is the start of a new cycle. Meetings follow the cycles: the first meeting in a cycle, held during spring, is primarily used to asses the services rendered in the previous cycle, and the general conduct of all covenant members.</div>
<div>Rights, Responsibilities and Sharing</div>
<div>The council decides on rights for prospecti regarding use of the library and labs on a case by case basis, and visitators have a set agreement with the covenant at the time they join, in accordance with the Peripheral Code rulings of Rhine Tribunal. Apprentices may only use the library by sharing their parens’ rights and priorities. Prospecti have the right to ask the council once per cycle for elevation to haeres. No prospectus is granted library access without having performed a service or made an equivalent donation to the covenant. Services rendered in one cycle can allow for privileges only during the following cycle. Haeres likewise need to have performed a service in the previous cycle in order to gain full privileges for library, laboratories, and projects. Lacking this they may only borrow books no other magus with library privileges desires to read; note that a privileged magus may only claim one book per season. Once the use of a laboratory has been granted, the council cannot take this away, save by completely dismissing a magus, but only a privileged magus is granted funding to run his</div>
<div>lab from the covenant coffers. Lacking this, the magus needs to pay from his own silver and use only his own exotic or expensive materials. A service is defined as a season’s worth of writing a suitable book, enchanting a suitable device, or finding or securing a vis source — all to be donated to the covenant. This may also cover any action which takes a significant amount of time, or is dangerous and requires time to recuperate. While most such services are accepted, the council may call for a vote as to whether a given service is valid. Serving on a seat is not by itself a service, however only rarely does a magus not spend at least one season on his responsibilities. Further services may be rendered, as this affects the vis salary. At the start of a cycle, when services are being tallied, the vis income is accounted for. After subtracting from this amount the fixed expenses for projects for the common good, any remainder is divided up in shares. The fixed expenses are primarily the casting of the Aegis of the Hearth, devices commissioned for the covenant’s use, healing magics, or Longevity Rituals. In case of a deficit the council must cover the necessary expenses and plan for reduced expenses or increased income for the following cycle. When vis salary is distributed each haeres receives two shares, and the Elder is granted an additional half share for his greater responsibilities. Prospecti are granted a half share. Any haeres or visitators performing additional services during a cycle are granted another single share per service, or only half a share for prospecti. The vis is divided as best it can be into shares, and any remainder is saved until the next cycle and added to the income. Any magi finding books or vis may keep it, dividing among themselves as they see fit. Donating such a find counts as a service. Any vis source found in the domain of Collem Leonis must be given over to the covenant, although the magi finding and securing it are granted the harvest of the first year. As there are no set borders for the covenant’s domain the council decides on a case by case basis. Any vis sources found elsewhere may be kept by the magi who found it, but protecting it is their personal responsibility.</div>
<div>Censure and Dismissal</div>
<div>Any maga not following the rules of the charter may be censured by a vote of the council. A haeres is demoted to prospectus, and after one full cycle she may petition the council to take a vote to elevate her to haeres again. A prospectus or visitator is dismissed from the covenant. She has one full season to clear out her chambers and lab, and thereafter may not</div>
<div>enter the covenant’s domain for a period of 5 years. Peregrinatores are protected by the Laws of Hospitality and the rulings in the Rhine Tribunal’s Peripheral Code, and cannot be dismissed under Collem Leonis’ charter. Notes left by a legally oriented previous member suggest simply paying off troublesome peregrinatores to leave prematurely if need be.</div>
<div>Peripheral Charter</div>
<div>The peripheral charter contains rules based on decisions made by the council on various occasions. Only the rules are recorded in this document, perhaps to keep it brief. Delving into the chronicles of Collem Leonis may reveal the circumstances behind the rulings. The peripheral charter states that the following short rules apply universally and shall not be subject to further scrutiny. It claims that it is sufficient to know that they exist for very good reasons.</div>
<div>• The ancestral sites of the tallest hill of the area may not be visited, except by members of House Bjornaer. • No lions, or for that matter any sort of large feline, may ever be hunted without the express permission of a resident Bjornaer magus. • There exists total equality between the two genders: no positions remain closed to women, nor are they refused the right to vote. (As this is not specifically mentioned to only apply to magi the rule is enforced universally.) • The servants and covenfolk are allowed time off from work in accordance with local customs for celebrations and holidays, including, but not limited to, starts and ends of seasons, harvest, midsummer, midwinter, and various religious festivals. The Autocrat is the arbiter of these events but no more than 20 covenfolk may be spared from service at a time. • No fiery animals may enter the library. In fact no open flame may ever be present there. • Any animated dead sent on errands must be managed by a suitable party who can control them if need be. No council member needs to accept the help of such walking dead if they do not conform to his ideas of discretion and aesthetics, and she has the right to ask for other help more appropriate to the situation.</div>

<h3>Covenant Site</h3>

<div>The visual experience of Collem Leonis’ main site from a distance is one of grandeur, which gradually changes to decaying oncegreatness as one approaches it. In addition to the stone manor, the covenant owns a townhouse in Dortmund, a disused mine, and without doubt a number of lesser locations forgotten by all remaining magi and covenfolk.</div>

<h3>Environment</h3>

<div>The buildings of Collem Leonis lie between the steep forested slopes of Sauerland, on top of a low hill. Surrounding the main site is a modest earthen dyke roughly 200 feet in diameter, with an unmaintained wooden palisade. The only opening faces the path to the nearest village and once held a wooden gate, which has long since been taken down and used for makeshift construction work. The terrain slopes gently away from the foot of the earthworks and was once cleared of trees within a bowshot’s length, but bushes and weeds have grown. Beyond this begins a thick forest. As one moves down the hill the Magic aura fades away, giving rise to a Faerie aura of 1 in most of the surrounding area, save for small pockets of Magic aura where the vis sources are found.</div>

<h3>Main Structures</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis consists of an imposing rectangular manor hall constructed from large stone blocks with a sturdy slate roof. Originally, it was a very defensible structure, but over the centuries the massive main doors have been complemented with a series of secondary entries. The old, small windows have been enlarged in several places, or converted into doors on the ground floor. A few of the upper story rooms have been fitted with wooden balconies. The main entrance leads into the entrance hall that contains the main staircase to the upper levels, dividing the ground floor into two sections. To the left is the kitchen, servants’ quarters, a secondary spiral staircase, and storage areas. To the right is the library and scriptorium, as well as the dining hall, which also doubles as council chamber. The upper floors hold the laboratories and sancta, but many of these now stand as empty rooms. The hall stands in a large yard with patches of cobblestone between larger expanses of gravel or muddy puddles, where chickens and pigs mill around. Half empty stables and shacks hold the</div>
<div>animals and wagons. A deep and finely engineered well sits between two leaning outbuildings near the kitchens. It was once surrounded by beds of herbs and spices, which are now swamped by weeds and shaded by listing walls. In the covenant’s heyday the place would have resounded with the hammering of the armorer and the sound of formation marching and orders barked. Now it emits the gentle sounds of a small, sleepy hamlet.</div>

<h3>Laboratories</h3>

<div>The manor hall has space for eight standard laboratories, and earlier generations had reserved two of these for visitators or peregrinatores, fitting them out for transient use. Earlier resident Bjornaer magi made their sancta in the woodlands outside the ring wall and the Aegis in a place unknown to the current residents; see Hidden Resources later. In 1220 one of these rooms is a customized laboratory in use by Ferra. Four others are standard laboratories used by Tiberius, Baliana, Julia and Freki. The laboratories of the older generation of magi were either emptied of equipment as they left or so highly personalized that a clean start was preferred. The remaining three laboratories have not been used for anything constructive in almost a century. They are used to store unwanted materials and refuse, and useful items needed elsewhere have been scavenged. The baseline for a covenant is one standard Size 0 laboratory per magus, for a total of five. One of these is Ferra’s personalized laboratory, which has an additional cost of 20 Build Points for the balance of Virtues and Flaws. With the additional three unmaintained transient laboratories (at 0 Build Points each) this makes eight in total. Laboratories sum up to 20 Build Points</div>
<div>Ferra’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Ferra has customized her laboratory over the years. Her enchanted device Dominator of Ghosts (see earlier) does not cost Build Points since it is personally owned. Names added to Sanctum marker: Heinrich Characteristics: Size +0 (0), General Quality +2, Safety – 1, Health – 1, Refinement +3, Upkeep +4, Warping 0, Aesthetics +5 Virtues and Flaws: Greater Feature (Summoning Circle), Greater Expansion, Living Quarters, Specimens (bound ghosts), Superior Construction, Superior Lighting, Highly Organized, Servant, (Otto, Int +2) Spotless; Greater Focus (summoning circle), Missing Equipment, No Stores, Undecorated</div>

<h3>Outlying Buildings</h3>

<div>Additional outbuildings jut from the stone walls of the main hall in no discernible order. The earliest of these have stone foundations, but over time wood and wattle shacks with thatched roofs sprang up with little planning or care. Some have</div>
<div>decayed and crumbled over the centuries, and others are only maintained by means of substandard work and materials, giving newcomers the overall impression of a chaotic mess. But on closer inspection the details of the high quality buildings can be seen, and with a little work the place could regain a lot of its original impressive appearance. Outbuildings growing from the left side are workshops for smithcraft, carpentry, leather working, or work areas for butchers, sausage makers, and brewers. Outbuildings to the right, entered from the scriptorium, are fewer and of better quality, and once held shops for vellum makers and book binders. Most workshops have fallen into disuse since very few goods are produced here anymore and the main kitchen has more than ample space to serve the dwindling population.</div>

<h3>Uncontrolled Portals</h3>

<div>The highly mutable entrances to Magic and Faerie regiones are Collem Leonis’ most distinctive feature, one of the main reasons for the founding of a covenant at this location, as well a focal point for centuries of research and daring expeditions. Although the portals are unpredictable, generations of magi have meticulously registered every time the portals opened and what came through them, together with times, places, actions taken, and any associated events that could be interpreted as forewarning. All recorded events have occurred in the forested hills and valleys within a few days’ trek of the main covenant buildings. Eventually the covenant accumulated an extensive library of these events, and several prediction charts. Characters who are familiar with the portals and have access to the texts are able to make educated guesses about portal events. By interpreting subtle omens, including weather, vegetation, and animal behavior, they can form a theory about which portal will open, where, when, and either what will come through or may be sought by entering. An open portal appears as a terrain feature or piece of vegetation that seems out of place, and is surrounded by a vague, shimmering light. This odd feature is actually showing what the regio opens up to, and investigating magi have a chance of deducing to which area inside the regio the portal leads. Sometimes the opening starts out as a small point of light, growing to the size of a large tree within days, while at other times it opens immediately. The light is easier to notice at dusk and dawn, but observers who are not familiar with it often dismiss the phenomenon as a trick of light or shadows. While the portals are a liability, with the risk</div>
<div>of monsters arriving and threatening the covenant’s resources or relations, they also represent enormous potential assets. Through the use of clever diplomacy many monsters and magical animals have been used as challenging hunting expeditions for the ruling count, to further cement the ties and special privileges enjoyed by Collem Leonis. A lot of vis is harvested at these times, but the frequency and yield is so random that this is not counted among the stable vis sources. The portals also seem to be partly responsible for the aura and vis in the area. Several sample storylines connected to these portals can be found in the section The Covenant in Play, later. Lesser and fairly frequently occurring events might include the following. A pack of gigantic, ferocious, and highly clever wolves who terrorize the area during a harsh winter. Large boars made of stone who individually track vis in the form of plants and fungus by smell, potentially leading the magi to new sources, if the boars do not eat it first. Faeries pretending to be various Nordic gods roam the area influencing how the villagers farm their lands, who they marry, and who they do battle with.</div>
<div>Predicting Events</div>
<div>The Ability Area Lore: Collem Leonis Portals covers knowledge of both the history and properties of the Magic and Faerie regiones. Characters can study this Ability from the records of previous events and research by earlier magi. This is the method that was used to keep watch and predict events before they unfurled, so as to be better prepared. A character actively keeping watch decides on the period she wants to cover, and how long she will spend looking for signs. The watcher makes a stress roll of Int + Area Lore: Collem Leonis Portals against an Ease Factor of 15, but higher results yield additional information and details. A number of</div>
<div>modifiers also apply as outlined later. The results of a successful roll are shown on the table. Prediction Roll: Stress Roll of Int + Area Lore: Collem Leonis Portals Modifiers: – 3 for spending 10 days or less observing and consulting texts +1 for spending a month +3 for spending an entire season – 3 for spending more than half the observation time in the library rather than in the field +1 for the quantity and quality of Collem Leonis’ current reference materials +1 per scout with a score in Area Lore: Collem Leonis Portals of at least 5 who actively looks for signs. This may be done while performing normal work chores (hunting, logging, mining) away from the main covenant site. +3 if a character with Premonitions assists in the field. Only applies once. +3 for predicting for the current season 0 for predicting a season in advance – 3 for predicting more than a season in advance</div>
<div>Ease Factor achieved: 15	 Location is narrowed down to one cardinal direction relative to the covenant, but no further details are known. If no portal will open, the character knows this. 18	 Location is predicted to a single valley, hill, cave system, lake etc. The realm affiliation and general type of the event is known: animal migration, supernatural animals, monstrous attack, weird weather phenomenon. 21	 Location is known precisely. The specific creature or phenomenon is known, plus details of its motivations, possible countermeasures, and so on. Characters with Premonitions may attempt to learn about the portals using their Supernatural Ability. Use the same Ease Factors, but with no modifiers. Characters with Visions may receive visions about the portals, at the storyguide’s discretion. Monitoring the portals in this way does not need any magical ability, and is a poor use of a maga’s time. Unfortunately, at present there is no one in the covenant who understands the portals well enough to even attempt predictions.</div>
<div>Magical Regio: Jotunheim</div>
<div>When the portals are magical in nature, they open up to what the magi of Collem Leonis call Jotunheim, referring to Norse myths. In this cosmology Jotunheim is one of nine worlds and inhabited by the giants. The regio has two levels, one of aura strength 3 and one of strength 8, both</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Is This Really Jotunheim?</h3>

<div>Maybe. There are magical giants, a tie to Norway, and physical similarities. Many of the giants know runic magic, and the leaders are full-fledged Vitkar as described in Hedge Magic Revised Edition, pages 120–141. The giants also refer to themselves as “Jotunn”. Earlier magi at Collem Leonis have seen no reason to doubt their assessment.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>aligned with chaos (see Realms of Power: Magic, pages 15–16), a very rare occurrence indeed. Anyone inside the regio must roll a number of additional botch dice equal to half the aura rating. These extra dice are not subject to reduction by Cautious Sorcerer, Spell Mastery, Gold Cord, or any other known Hermetic means. Perhaps in compensation, the regio produces one pawn of vis, in an appropriate Form, for every zero rolled when checking for a magical botch. The lower level of the regio is a primordial wilderness with towering mountains, thick forests, flowering valleys, raging rivers, and breathtaking fjords. Entry from Sauerland always leads to a pass in an immensely high mountain range, with perpetual storm clouds overhead. Animals found here are large and remarkable specimens of wolves, bears, boars, foxes, hawks, ravens, wild bulls, and horses. Some are even giant sized, have special powers, or are intelligent. Rare finds include the occasional Norse dragon or a lindorm. The sun moves at varying speeds across the sky making navigation and keeping tabs on the passage of time difficult. Previous expeditions have attempted to map this level, taking the coldest area as the north, but the rapid changes due to the chaotic nature of the regio have made the maps unreliable. The higher level completely surrounds the lower level. The entrance point from the portal is close to the centre of the lower level, and a few days’ trek in any direction brings visitors to some form of difficult terrain. Scaling the almost vertical mountains to the east leads to the domain of the storm giants. To the north the mountains gradually give way to a rocky wasteland of snow and ice, the domain of mountain giants. There is no known ruler of these lands, but the previous generation of magi believed this direction led to Niflheim, a world of cold and ice. To the south lies a dusty, sun-baked and broken land, the domain of fire giants. Beyond this is believed to lie Muspelheim, the world of fire and heat. To the west the terrain slopes down, leading the rivers of meltwater among the forested mountains and valleys to deep fjords, which again lead to the sea. This sea appears vast and endless, and the few scouts sent sailing or flying into the ocean have all been driven back by wind and waves. The magi have discovered two local ways into this regio. Most simply, it can be entered when the portal is open. Earlier magi also discovered that access is possible by following a route up the hill known locally as Eisenhöhe, but only under astrological conditions that occur roughly every 10 years. This leads to the same point in the lower level as the portal. Once inside, moving between the levels is achieved by braving the difficult terrain, be it vertical cliff faces, frozen mountains, scorching desert,</div>
<div>or endless ocean. Indeed, some earlier magi have suggested that there is only one level to the regio, and that the strength of the aura varies from place to place within it. Others argued that the strength of the aura defines a regio level. Whether this debate is more than semantic remains to be seen. The lower level has a number of exits that lead to uninhabited parts of Norway. These are easy to use from within the regio, and can be used to enter the regio, following the normal rules for crossing regio boundaries (ArM5, page 189). Exiting back to Sauerland is only possible while the portal is open. Transportation magic works within the regio, and can take characters out through the portal to Sauerland while the portal is open. If the portal closes while people are inside, the only options are to leave via Norway, or to wait inside for the portal to open once more.</div>
<div>Faerie Regio: Midgard</div>
<div>When the Norse gods ruled these lands, magic creatures ruled the wilderness and the faeries playing the parts of the Norse heroes and gods thrived in the reverence of the humans. The arrival of Christianity and the Dominion pushed them back, and now they are all but gone from the mundane world. In the Nordic cosmology Midgard was the domain of men, occasionally visited by the Aesir and Vanir gods, giving rise to stories and myths. The previous generation of magi named this Faerie regio Midgard because it is a recreation of the life the Nordic people lived centuries ago. It has a Faerie aura of strength 6. Incognizant faeries play the parts of farmers, princes, and kings, as well as the animals and monsters who plague them. Each spring they abandon their daily duties and sail off on viking raids to prove their manliness and bring home riches. The passage of time is so swift between visits that even if only a year passes in the mundane world the oldest son has replaced his father as king in the regio. Collem Leonis’ magi believe the faeries are focused on the social life of changing generations and all this entails: feuds, alliances, intermarriage, inheritance. Highly Cognizant faeries play the Nordic gods who visit Midgard occasionally, typically when they have lured mundanes into the regio to interact and play the part of heroes, fighting monsters, participating in viking raids or wars, and eventually winning the hand of the king’s daughter. At times the faerie gods plague the mundane realm by staging a march to war or a monstrous invasion, in accordance with some story or myth. All these faeries have stories they want visiting humans to participate in, and stronger faeries might take over stories initiated by their lesser brethren and twist it into a tale about themselves.</div>
<div>Physically Midgard is similar to the mundane world, with natural hills, forests, pastures, and fields, but it is in constant flux. Viking strongholds and villages lie at rivers and on the coast, and exploration has shown the land to be a single, large island surrounded by a vast ocean. All manner of creatures from Nordic folk tales can be found: Elven maidens dance on grass-clad hills in the moonlight, dwarves work their smithies below the ground, and trolls demand tolls on roads and bridges; most of them set challenges for travelers and gain Vitality from interaction or countermeasures taken. The longships sail off with raiders each spring and return with loot, slaves, and livestock, always in lesser numbers due to casualties. As yet, the magi of Collem Leonis have not determined whether the raiders actually raid anywhere. The powers of the kings wax and wane as they war among themselves, form alliances, or are the victims of a dragon or lindorm. Visiting humans have every opportunity to interact in Nordic folk stories, with specific mythic historical figures, and with Nordic gods. Midgard can be entered in several ways: if led by an inhabitant, by sensing the boundaries, or by circling Eisenhöhe clockwise while a rainbow is visible in the sky. Leaving is harder. The faerie gods can grant anyone permission to leave, permission they grant once their story has finished, but the entry points are not exits, and the magi have yet to find any points in the regio from which they can leave by their own magic. When a portal opens to this regio, it can easily be traversed in either direction, but most of the time there is no portal.</div>

<h3>Associated Properties</h3>

<div>In the glory days there were many properties and locations off site in use by Collem Leonis, but now only a few are still known. Rumors claim several magi interested in the wilderness once lived outside the walls and Aegis.</div>
<div>Julia’s Townhouse</div>
<div>The townhouse in Dortmund where Julia lives is an unofficial site of Collem Leonis’. The building is old but well built and maintained. The ground floor holds the merchant shop of Julia’ foster father Frederick, with the front room used for business during the day and living quarters during the night. The back holds a kitchen and staircase, with storage in the cellar and a shed out back. The upper floor holds Julia’s simple yet stylish reception chamber for important clients. When studying Julia prefers to have the books brought from Collem Leonis to be close to her business. She is considering moving her lab here, but that could be interpreted as creating a chapter house and she is not sure she wants to pursue that avenue just yet.</div>
<div>Eisenhöhe and the Mine</div>
<div>The older generation dug into the hills for metals and minerals, particularly the highest hill, known locally as Eisenhöhe, and the covenfolk know the place well. Located halfway up the slope, the mine shaft, worn slippery by years of use as well as water trickling down it, leads to the floor of the mine’s antechamber. From here man-sized passages have been cut into the bedrock to follow veins of</div>
<div>the metals and minerals sought. Vis has always been harvested here and it is still an active vis source, though no longer in use as a mine. All the covenfolk have heard tales of the kobold who haunts the mine (see Resources, later).</div>

<h3>External Relations</h3>

<div>Although large expanses of forested hills are still unsettled in 1220 the recent almost explosive growth and emergence of towns and cities along the Rhine and its tributaries necessitates continual monitoring of mundane matters as well as the occasional intervention.</div>

<h3>Nobility</h3>

<div>When the covenant was founded, Tacitus of Tremere and Pamprepius of Flambeau, as the sociable and extrovert faction, worked to establish relations. The regiones brought an abundance of supernatural animals and beasts. Tacitus used this to reach an accord with Herr Reginald — a powerful knight who controlled the large tracts of wild lands where the covenant was situated as the Kingdom of Lotharingia emerged from the split of Middle Franconia. Reginald was seen as a defender against the hills, which were known to be teeming with all kinds of beasts and sinister magicians. He saw great advantages for both parties in an informal alliance with the Hermetic magi.</div>
<div>The political environment has changed many times since then, with the covenant’s site becoming part of the kingdom of Germany and the county of Berg. Berg-Althena split off from that county and was renamed the county of Mark in 1202. The noble families have changed even more often, as the posts are not necessarily hereditary. Through it all, the magi have managed to preserve their privileges and relationships. They are careful not to swear formal oaths of fealty, stay wary about how much information the count has, and avoid intervening directly.</div>
<div>Count of Mark</div>
<div>The current count has increased his land holdings as well as personal power to become one of the most influential lords of the Westphalia region. The counts of Mark have been an important part of the opposition to the archbishop of Cologne since the early 1200s, even though the archbishop is a cousin of the count. Thus, the situation in 1220 is potentially explosive. So far, the magi have simply avoided the issue, but if they get dragged in any further than defending themselves, they face a great deal of trouble under the Code. Count Adolph I knows that his vassal Herr Vorderhagen harbors wizards in an inhospitable part of his domain, and that said place is teeming with dangerous beasts and faerie beings. As the wizards do not seem to be actively harming anyone this arrangement suits him just fine. The forested hills are useless anyway, anything dangerous will be contained as per the agreement, and he assumes that he can call upon the magi at will, whether to hunt challenging and dangerous game or to provide help and counsel. If the saga follows history, Count Adolph I loses a significant portion of his northern domain between Dortmund and Soest to Archbishop Engelbert, until he is reconciled with the next archbishop. Later he inherits the land of a distant cousin — Frederick of Isenberg — and his power is on the rise again. Adolph lives to the ripe old age of 55, at which point his son Engelbert I of Mark inherits his lands in 1249.</div>
<div>Herr Vorderhagen</div>
<div>The formal lord of Collem Leonis is Herr Vorderhagen, a vassal knight to the count. His manor lies outside the wild forested hills, in the village of Micklingshaus. By means of hard work over generations the Flambeau and Tremere lineages have made this knightly family into a puppet of the covenant. Vorderhagen is a willing ally, because the wizards seem to influence the count</div>
<div>and help keep the lands in Vorderhagen’s family even though they are not hereditary, but he is secretly afraid of the sinister doings of the wizards in their crumbling lair. He prefers them as slightly distant allies, which also suits the magi.</div>
<div>Duke of Limburg and Count of Jülich</div>
<div>These neighboring areas are deeply intertwined with the counties of Mark and Berg. In 1220, the duke of Limburg is Henry III, who is succeeded by his son Waleran III in 1221. In the 1220s, the dynasty is involved in disputes with the archbishop of Cologne concerning territory and inheritance. If your saga follows history, then Henry IV, the son of Waleran III, is named count of Berg in 1225 after the archbishop’s death, and subsequently duke of Limburg in 1226 after the death of his father Waleran III. Waleran III’s daughter, Mathilda of Limburg, married Count William III of Jülich, and in 1220 their son William IV is count. These family ties keep the domains united in their struggle with the archbishop of Cologne.</div>
<div>Freiherr Reinhart II of Soest</div>
<div>The current lord of these lands is the older brother of Tiberius of Flambeau (who was born Meitzler of Soest). He recently inherited the title from their father Reinhart I. The freiherr’s lands lie at the eastern end of the county of Mark, bordered by the domains of the bishops of Münster and Paderborn respectively, both staunch allies of the archbishop of Cologne. Reinhart II is a reluctant supporter of the count of Mark’s faction in opposition to the archbishop of Cologne, since his own lands are threatened by ecclesiastical domains. No matter how hard pressed the freiherr may be he refuses to even make contact with his longlost younger brother Meitzler. Enemies of the freiherr know they need not fear repercussions if they move against his black sheep brother, causing a multitude of problems for Tiberius in his attempts to keep Collem Leonis out of an open conflict between the count of Mark and the archbishop of Cologne</div>

<h3>The Church</h3>

<div>The main challenge in relations with the church is that the current archbishop of Cologne, Engelbert I, is also a powerful noble, major landholder, and a warmonger.</div>
<div>Engelbert</div>
<div>Engelbert has ruled as Engelbert I, archbishop of Cologne since 1216, and is also duke of Westphalia in virtue of his ecclesiastical office. He has also ruled as Engelbert II, count of Berg since 1218, when his older brother, Count Adolph VI of Berg, died with a daughter, Irmgard of Berg, as his only child. Note the differences in number of the clerical and noble titles. The archbishopric he took over was suffering great civil unrest, and he campaigned against the duke of Limburg and count of Cleves for years to consolidate the archbishopric’s lands. In 1217, Irmgard of Berg married Henry IV of Limburg, the son of Duke Waleran III, against whom Engelbert was waging war at the time. The dispute over succession to the title of count of Berg was temporarily settled in 1220 when Engelbert paid off the Duke of Limburg. If your saga follows history, then the territorial disputes cool off in 1225, when Archbishop Engelbert I is murdered by his cousin Frederick, declared a martyr, and later canonized as a saint. His successor as archbishop is Heinrich I von Mullnarken. The pressure from the archbishop diminishes further in 1288, when Cologne becomes a Free Imperial City and the seat of the archdiocese is moved to Bonn, further south along the Rhine.</div>

<h3>City of Dortmund</h3>

<div>The previous generation of Tremere are suspected of having been instrumental in Dortmund’s evolution from insignificant village to Free Imperial City. Just how influential they were has never been determined by any mundane or magical agency. The trade and craft guilds of Dortmund have had dealings with Collem Leonis in the past through the Tremere as intermediaries. Even though the magi used magic to sweeten their part of the deal, this also benefited the city. Any attempt to increase the income of Collem Leonis is sure to cross paths with a guild in Dortmund. See the section The Covenant in Play later for more story ideas.</div>
<div>Covenants of the Order of Hermes</div>
<div>Collem Leonis was founded after the Peripheral Code ruling of 780 giving existing</div>
<div>covenants the right to veto the founding of a new covenant, but was unopposed. As of 1220 the covenant has yet to make use of this right. In the few years that have passed since they took over, the young magi of Collem Leonis have formed a few relations with other magi and covenants, in connection with ongoing projects and issues. As of 1220, they have no significant links to Oculus Septentrionalis, Waddenzee, or Triamore.</div>
<div>Crintera</div>
<div>Freki has ties to her domus magna through her sept and clan. Her personal project of investigating shapeshifters in the north is neither well known nor a goal for her House, so she has no allies in this. Her mater has a more aggressive attitude toward shapeshifters and her allies may become enemies of Freki’s. The original reason for founding a covenant at Collem Leonis’ site was the sighting of a Great Beast, and many Bjornaer magi are interested in this, as well as in the protection of an ancestral site.</div>
<div>Durenmar</div>
<div>Collem Leonis’ long lineage of Bonisagi has always ensured ties to Durenmar. This is still true, since Baliana’s pater resides here during the winter months, and her mentor Occultes is always present. Notable Ash Gild member Philippus Niger has also noticed Baliana and her projects, as he is also involved in the battle against the Order of Odin, tying him to both Occulus Septentrionalis and the new covenant of Heorot. Both Occultes and Philippus Niger are prepared to lend assistance and hints to Baliana, but want something in return, at some point.</div>
<div>Heorot</div>
<div>This prospective covenant hidden among the marshlands of Zealand in Denmark may seek recognition as an official covenant at Tribunal in 1221. If this is to be successful they need support or at least indifference from all Rhine covenants, as even a single veto thwarts their attempt to found Heorot. The magus Pancrestius of Bonisagus is interested in researching and cataloging local, Nordic magic traditions. He is a protege of Philippus Niger and filius of Occultes, both from Durenmar. Occultes also happens to be Baliana’s mentor, and she has recently taken the first steps toward working with Pancrestius.</div>
<div>Fengheld</div>
<div>Once Collem Leonis returns to the political arena Fengheld, being powerful yet not terribly old, is naturally wary. Julia has ties through Stentorius of Tremere, who is her Exarch and holds her sigil. Fengheld’s chapter house in Cologne is a concern due to its proximity to Collem Leonis, and Fengheld may be attracted by Dortmund.</div>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis is much weaker than it was in its heyday. Some resources have been lost permanently, while others may be restored with varying amounts of effort.</div>

<h3>Income Sources</h3>

<div>The covenant lives off hunting, gathering, and logging. The surplus of these resources is traded to the nearby village for local produce. This constitutes a Typical source of income for the covenant, although considering the extremely low number of covenfolk only a small portion of the potential is actually used in 1220. Collem Leonis has supported at least three times the current number of inhabitants in the past and it could do so again. The mine in the hills could be re-opened as a profitable yet labor intensive source of income, although magical assistance could ease this considerably. Using her contacts among traders and craftsmen in Dortmund, Julia could once again turn a profit from metals mined and goods crafted.</div>

<h3>Enchanted Devices</h3>

<div>The devices serving as badges of office or integral to daily life are well known to the magi. The powers and, more importantly, the activation requirements are found in the old chronicles of Collem Leonis. However, a storyguide or troupe using this covenant for a saga and wanting a bigger challenge could rule that the devices are mentioned in only vague terms and the player magi therefore need to investigate and identify the effects one by one. Records also hint at the existence of other devices which are now lost or hidden, see Story Seed: Banquet of Wasteful Opulence, later. Given the relatively few devices and their importance the magi had little difficulty in keeping tabs on them while other resources were more easily lost over time. All devices have a base effect (not counting</div>
<div>modifiers) below 6th magnitude and so do not cause Warping due to powerful effects, although some may Warp with prolonged use. Enchanted Devices are worth 114 Build Points.</div>
<div>Clasp of the Ambassador</div>
<div>A clasp for a cloak made from silver with a violet amethyst mounted so that it can be rotated. It is an invested device prepared with 15 pawns of vis as only the amethyst was enchanted, and the following effects take up 6 pawns of space. It was created by Tacitus of Tremere in the 870s as the badge of office for the Seat of the Ambassador — a title coined by himself in order to inflate his importance on the ruling council of Collem Leonis. Its cost is 22 Build Points.</div>
<div>Aura of Beguiling Appearance MuIm 15 Pen 0, 12/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind A variant of the spell Aura of Ennobled Presence, which causes the target to appear more friendly, conciliatory, and credible. The character gets +3 on rolls to win trust and make friends, but still suffers any effects of The Gift. This spell was first mentioned in Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 96. It is activated by turning the amethyst clockwise in the silver housing. (Effect: Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; Modifications +5 uses/day)</div>
<div>Aura of Equality ReMe 40 Pen 32, 12/day R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind A variant of the spell Aura of Rightful Authority (ArM5, page 151), causing the target to accept the caster as an equal. This defuses a situation where the target is of higher rank and makes him open to negotiation. Tacitus of Tremere preferred this version as it is less risky compared to forcing orders on high-standing mundanes. His notes on the item also remark that the Penetration is sufficient to affect an archbishop with his Commanding Presence power (Realms of Power: The Divine, page 42–43) while inside a cathedral, where the Dominion protects him even further. Activated by looking the target in the eye, bowing slightly and speaking the words “Greetings my equal”. (Effect: Base 5, +1 Eye, +2 Sun; Modifications +4 uses/day; +16 Penetration)</div>
<div>Spear of the Armiger</div>
<div>This heavy longspear is made from a sturdy ash wood shaft reinforced by bands of bronze,</div>
<div>and was originally created by Pamprepius of Flambeau and attuned as his talisman. All the attunements, as well as personal effects specific to Pamprepius, are now useless and not detailed here. It was prepared with 24 pawns of vis; the useless effects take up 10 pawns of space and the usable effects listed below take up another 8 pawns, leaving 6 points of space for further effects. Pamprepius was known — as were his Hermetic descendants — for preferring a standup fight and trying to even the odds rather than butchering an enemy. Even though the device could affect creatures within shouting distance, all previous owners found this distasteful and have always merely spoken the command words softly. Its cost is 32 Build Points.</div>
<div>Blunt the Viper’s Fangs PeAn 40 Pen 20, 24/day R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind As the spell of the same name found in ArM5, page 119. The effect works on animals up to Size +7. Activated by making a swinging motion toward the target while saying the word “blunt”. (Effect: Base 5, +2 Voice +2 Size; Modifications +5 uses/day; +10 Penetration)</div>
<div>Invocation of Weariness PeCo 40 Pen 20, 24/day R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind As the spell of the same name found in ArM5, page 133. The effect works on humanoid bodies up to Size +4, as Pamprepius hated having his Corpus spells circumvented by giant-blooded enemies. Activated by making a stabbing motion toward the target while uttering the word “weariness”. (Effect: Base 10, +2 Voice, +1 Size; Modifications +5 uses/day; +10 Penetration)</div>
<div>Mask of the Predator</div>
<div>This is a terrifying mask made from the skull of a wolf, with occult symbols inlaid in silver. It was created by Wolfgang of Bjornaer and granted to his favorite filia, Ulvisa, to help her follow in his footsteps in the Seat of the Predator. It was prepared with 15 pawns of vis, as the sum of the medium sized skull of bone and a tiny amount of silver decorations, and filled with only 8 pawns worth of effects. Several of the users of this mask have, through the centuries, developed spells to meld the bone mask to their bodies to be able to bring it along when changing shape, but have yet to add this as an effect in the device. Its cost is 26 Build Points.</div>
<div>Immediate Sense of What Treads the Surface InTe 30 Pen 0, unlimited uses R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part The user has an instant sense of all creatures touching the ground within 1000 paces, with no more detail than rough mass, speed, and direction. It is activated by closing one’s eyes and touching the ear of the mask to the ground. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +2 Size; Modifications +10 unlimited use)</div>
<div>Eyes of the Bat InAu 34 Pen 0, 12/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Hearing As the spell of the same name found in ArM5, page 127. It is activated by closing one’s eyes and tilting one’s head rapidly once each to the left and to the right. (Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch +1 Conc +3 Hearing; Modifications +5 maintains concentration, +4 uses/day)</div>
<div>Circlet of the Governor</div>
<div>Amadeus of Bonisagus made this enchanted gold circlet for his much-appreciated amica Briana to help her in her daily business of monitoring and running the covenant from the Seat of the Governor. It was prepared with 20 pawns of vis, and filled with 4 pawns worth of effects. It is fitted with a fixed Arcane Connection to the fireplace in the council chamber, but can work with any other connection to a suitable medium. Its cost is 22 Build Points.</div>
<div>Summoning the Distant Image InIm 30 Pen 0, 24/day R: Arcane, D: Concentration, T: Ind As the spell of the same name found in ArM5, page 145. It is activated by touching the circlet with both hands while crossing the arms. Amadeus noted that the use of this effect without the following one could constitute scrying if a magus is present. (Effect: Base 2, +4 Arc, +1 Conc, +2 Room; Modifications +5 uses/day)</div>
<div>Phantasm of the Talking Head CrIm 25 Pen 0, 24/day R: Arcane, D: Concentration, T: Ind As the spell of the same name found in ArM5, page 145. It is activated by touching the circlet with one hand at the forehead and one at the back.</div>
<div>(Effect: Base 2, +4 Arc, +1 Diam, +1 intelligible speech; Modifications +5 uses/day)</div>
<div>Woodshed of Plenty CrHe 30 Pen 0, Unlimited use R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Group During the first generation of Collem Leonis it saddened Adler of Bjornaer to use the covenant’s rights to logging, so she created this magical woodshed. Subsequent users have remarked upon its ridiculously overpowered production. Opening and closing the door fills the shed with ten cubic paces of wood in nice, fireplace sized logs. As a result there was little reason to touch the forest, as all the needs for wood for fuel could be met. The duration of Moon is even enough to barter the wood to the nearest villages for local food products; by trading frequently and only small amounts at a time the magi ensure that the wood is used before mystically disappearing. The forest stays as thick as ever. Adler wrote that anyone activating the shed before it was wholly emptied of the previous production of wood should be flogged with a whip made from their own skin. Records do not elaborate on whether this has ever actually happened. If using the economic system of Covenants, pages 56–71, this device results in cost savings equal to three laborers. Its cost is 12 Build Points. (Effect: Base 2, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Group; Modifications +10 unlimited use)</div>

<h3>Library</h3>

<div>Although Collem Leonis’ collection contains some sound works, it lacks the volume needed to truly call it a library. An old covenant having seen many generations of magi should have adequate materials for grounding in all the Arts, as well as myriads of supplemental tractatus. According to Ferra it used to be much better, but she can offer no clear explanation as to what happened. She seems to remember Heinrich having once borrowed a couple of good books, but the younger magi are not sure what to make of that. Cursory investigation of Collem Leonis’ chronicle and covenant rolls suggests that some resources were taken by the old magi to their places of retirement, and most of the lab texts and books on spell masteries were ruined by a fire a decade ago, but much of the library should still be around the covenant, somewhere. This is described in the section Hidden Resources later. The library, as it stands, amounts to a mere 324 Build Points worth of books and 72 of spells.</div>

<div>Texts about the Uncontrolled Portals</div>
<div>Collem Leonis has over the centuries accumulated a lot of material on the ever changing regio entrances. These texts contain meticulous records of times, places, events, countermeasures taken, vis or resources procured, and the consequences of the situation. There are many maps of the mundane areas where the portals appeared, and of the regiones. Additionally there are many attempts to form a grand, unifying theory of the unique situation, but all have been found flawed over time. All unfinished research material is also archived here. As outlined in the section Covenant Site earlier, this material can be used to predict future openings of the portals, but can also function as study material on lthe phenomenon, comparable to a Summa. The game mechanics of the material has deliberately been designed with the potential to bring readers to high levels of knowledge, if they invest a great deal of time.</div>

<h3>Vis Stocks</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis’ vault holds a total of 35 pawns of vis, all from the covenant’s own sources: 25 pawns of Vim vis (silver liquid) and 10 pawns of Terram vis (blue stones). This adds up to 5 Build Points.</div>

<h3>Vis Sources</h3>

<div>The vis sources for Collem Leonis known by the resident magi yield a total of 19 pawns annually, amounting to 95 Build Points. All</div>

<div>sources are marked clearly with the covenant symbol in relief on a rock and have been properly registered with the Redcaps.</div>
<div>Silver Spring</div>
<div>Each year on the first day of spring, a certain stream formed by melting snow turns silver. Catching this slow trickle of water before it touches the ground yields 8 pawns of Vim vis over a day.</div>
<div>Albino Stoat</div>
<div>An extended family of partly domesticated stoats lives near the covenant, and one of the litters always includes an albino. The old records mention that the albino always flies into a blood rage upon reaching maturity and raids the chicken coop during autumn. If the animal is killed without the skin being pierced and subsequently exsanguinated, the blood contains 4 pawns of Animal vis, which does not appear until the rage is imminent. There is no mention of anyone ever having tried to capture and breed the albino stoat.</div>
<div>Blue Stones of the Mine</div>
<div>Starting out as small specks of dark blue on the mine walls in random places, the vis grow in size until they are fist-sized bulbous protrusions. Once ready they fall off the wall like a ripe fruit during summer. If not picked up within a few days, they dissolve and end up as a purple stain on the floor, the vis being re-absorbed into the stone. The annual yield of this source is 7 pawns of Terram vis. Collection is not hard in itself, but old covenant records warn about the kobold of the mine.</div>

<h3>Wealth</h3>

<div>Currently Collem Leonis’ coffers hold the modest sum of 10 Mythic Pounds of silver, worth 1 Build Point.</div>

<h3>Hidden Resources</h3>

<div>The better part of the resources Collem Leonis accumulated during its lifetime is not readily available for the Second Spring covenant, and is represented by the Hidden Resources Boon. The specifics of these are listed below with story seeds for the search. Searching for clues takes a month studying old chronicles, maps, and covenant rolls, and a stress roll of Int + Organization Lore: Collem Leonis against an Ease Factor of 12. Devoting an entire season to the investigation grants a +3 modifier. Success means something is found, leading to one of the stories.</div>
<div>Franka’s Hermetic Nursery</div>
<div>An old covenant like Collem Leonis has turned out many apprentices over the centuries, so why is the library so very poor? How did the magi of old ever attain sufficient grounding in the arts to be able to teach without causing a deficiency in the pupil? Around 1195 one</div>
<div>of the old magi, in a fit of intricate plans only rational to herself, made off with all the introductory books on the Arts. If recovered, they add 325 Build Points to Collem Leonis’ library. Oddly enough, information about the authors has been deleted from all the texts, and there is some speculation as to whether any books were originally written by magi of Diedne before the Schism. The books have been wrapped in cloth and leather in a dry cave, and are well preserved.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The Winter Litter</h3>

<div>One year the stoats produce a litter consisting entirely of albinos, but as it happens during winter the blanket of snow makes it exceedingly difficult to keep track of them. What to do? Will they all contain vis, and can the hunters manage so many animals on a berserk raid among the chickens? To make matters worse the snow lingers much longer into spring than it usually does, and a predator targets animals suspected of being magical. Investigation reveals that a very exotic snow leopard has come out of the portal. The leopard is phenomenally stealthy and also far craftier than any animal should be: it moves through the tops of closestanding trees, and squeezes through narrow cracks in the rocky hills. It sets false tracks to lead the hunters astray so they suddenly find themselves far away from the covenant when the leopard attacks, or led deep into a dangerous swamp close to sunset. Note that the Peripheral Charter requires the express permission of the resident Bjornaer magus to hunt any felines. Once the predator is dealt with, the challenge lies in preserving the vis source or harvesting it for best results. If several breeding pairs are killed the chances are that next year there will be no albino in the litters. The vis source may take years to recover. On the other hand, the many albinos may be problematic to contain and kill as they fight among themselves and spill the vis-laden blood.</div>

<div>Joachim’s Stolen Cache</div>
<div>The loss of these books was caused by outright theft in 1208 when the last autocrat, Joachim, vanished without a trace. At that time the only resident magi were so old, eccentric, and busy that they did not even notice that these valuable resources were missing. If these can be recovered the library of Collem Leonis gains an additional 367 Build points worth of books. Joachim had let himself be tempted by a minor demon who sows seeds of dissatisfaction with superiors. He used his position to acquire texts on Goetic arts and kept them hidden while he studied diabolic rites. Eventually, he decided to run away with valuable texts from the library and sell them in order to start a new and more luxurious life. He made contact with the merchant calling himself Ruprecht of Lübeck, who offered to buy the Hermetic books, and took the books out of the covenant, hiding them in a cave. Then he disappeared.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The Mischievous Kobold</h3>

<div>The covenfolk of Collem Leonis who venture into the mine know of the old kobold and fear him, as all miners have been wary of his kin throughout history. If treated with respect and offered small things like food, beer, or simply requests for his permission, he merely plays innocent tricks, moving things around and making odd sounds in the dark. Should a miner plead sincerely for his help out loud the kobold may intervene. If the old traditions are blatantly disregarded, or the creature subjected to abuse, he harasses the culprits by leading them off into dangerous tunnels with illusions, stealing their equipment, or even weakening the rock to the point of a cave-in. Many a vis harvest crosses paths with the kobold, and more than a few have ended in close calls or full-scale disasters.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: Apprentice’s Lofty Cave</h3>

<div>The covenant chronicles mention that Franka of Bjornaer, having obtained only preliminary permission from the Council, collected a set of texts suitable for apprentices in order to optimize the learning process. She secretly intended to make this project only useful to Bjornaer apprentices with Heartbeasts compatible with her own, which was an owl. Her personal diary entries point toward one of the peaks defined as off-limits to all other than Bjornaer magi. Getting to the cave is challenging, as it is accessible only by flying and has an entrance no larger than a large bird. The founding maga Adler, who in her Final Twilight centuries ago took the form of her eagle Heartbeast as a Great Beast, takes a strong interest in this peak. She appears as a very large (Size –1) and near-perfect specimen of an eagle, with only Cunning but a Perception of +5, and a Magic Might of 30. If Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults is available refer to page 41 for the Eagle of Virtue . Adler makes things difficult for characters climbing the mountain, especially if they are not Bjornaer magi, but she stays hidden, using appropriate powers to cause trouble, unless a Bjornaer maga seeks her out with appropriate respect.</div>
<div>Story Seed: Sins of the Predecessor</div>
<div>At the last moment, Joachim repented, and went to the cave to set things right. He planned to bind the demon, destroy the Goetic books, and bring the Hermetic books back to the covenant. Joachim believed that he could bind the demon into a gold ring, then drop the ring into a lake, ensuring that the demon would never be found. Unfortunately for Joachim, he did not realize that the demon could use all of its powers while bound, and the demon, in a rage, killed him. He collapsed, in the cave, still gripping the ring. Holding an item with a bound demon gives a person or object the Magic Resistance of the demon, so Joachim’s corpse currently has Magic Resistance, one reason why it has not been found. The demon can communicate from the ring, and use its powers to help its wearer while it tries to corrupt him. It cannot, however, leave the ring, or communicate over a long distance, and it has been forced to wait. Someone from the area stumbles upon the cave while hunting, and finds the ring. The demon goads him into dreadful actions, which the player characters must deal with. Following his trail leads back to the cave, which contains the books and letters to Joachim from Ruprecht, concerning the purchase of the books. Erich the spy (see earlier) knows more about Ruprecht, but may be reluctant to share the information.</div>

<div>The Tree House</div>
<div>The nature-oriented Bjornaer magus Holzstein, from the second generation of magi at Collem Leonis, built himself a sanctum away from the covenant’s main site. Inside a small Magical regio he found an aura as strong as the main site (Magic aura 5), and even safer due to its hidden nature. The tether of the regio is a huge magical oak, inside and around which he built his lab. He reached an agreement with a wood spirit named Agnes, and cultivated a yew tree as Collem Leonis’ only Corpus vis source. The lab was inherited by his filii, but fell into disuse as they retreated to Crintera at the onset of the Schism War, and has been forgotten since then.</div>
<div>Holzstein’s Laboratory</div>
<div>Holzstein’s laboratory is built inside a large oak tree, encompassing a small regio inside it for extra space. Agnes the forest spirit (see nearby) is bound to the laboratory. The laboratory is worth 110 Build Points. Names added to Sanctum marker: None</div>
<div>Characteristics: Size +3(2), General Quality –3, Safety +1, Health + 1, Refinement 0, Upkeep –1, Warping +1, Aesthetics +2 Virtues and Flaws: Greater Feature (tree), Lesser Guardian (Agnes), Pot Plants, Spacious, Idyllic Surroundings, Dedicated Building, Regio; Greater Focus (tree), Decaying, Dirty, Infested, Missing Equipment (Texts), Missing Ingredients (Ignem, Terram) Specializations: Perdo +3, Rego +1; Herbam +11 Personality Traits: None Features: Magical oak Magic Items: None Notes: All Lab Totals using Ignem and Terram are currently halved due to lack of ingredients. All activities concerning Texts are impossible due to lack of equipment.</div>
<div>Vis Source: The Man in the Woods</div>
<div>This strangely shaped yew tree looks like a person. Two trunks form his legs, a mass of tangled branches constitute his body, a stump where the top snapped off long ago has facial features, and his arms are made up of long branches with smaller growths only where his talon-like fingers reach out. Golden resin spills out from cracks, which can be harvested at the end of each season for 2 pawns of Corpus vis each time. The Man in the Woods is worth 40 Build Points.</div>
<div>The Armoire of Excess</div>
<div>The device is a large, intricately carved cabinet of flawless walnut wood, a work of art in itself. It has been prepared with 10 paws of vis, 6 of which are used for the single effect listed here. The armoire is worth 22 Build Points. This item has not been lost, exactly. Rather, something became stuck between one of the doors and its frame, making it impossible to open. As the two doors must be opened together to activate the magic, it can no longer be used. This happened decades ago; the servants were too scared of breaking the item to try to fix it, and the magi were too wrapped up in their own concerns. The cabinet is now used to store other things, and none of the current servants even remember what it used to do. The covenant records reveal the existence of this item, and Intellego Vim is the fastest way to find it, once the magi know that they should be looking.</div>

<div>Agnes is a minor forest spirit who was bound voluntarily to Holzstein’s laboratory and helped him in his day. She has been lonely since the laboratory was abandoned, but has taken adequate care of the sanctum. She is suspicious of intruders after so long, but if treated with respect and kindness she will happily bond with a new master.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: Lost Laboratory</h3>

<div>The Man in the Woods was a source of Corpus vis for the covenant, and is recorded, along with Holzstein’s remote laboratory, and its transfer to his descendants. Research in the records is enough to reveal the general location, but not details of how to enter the regio, nor of what lies within. A research roll that beats an Ease Factor of 15 hints that there was some sort of allied spirit, but the records have no details on Agnes. She initially uses her powers to dissuade characters from entering, although she avoids harming, much less killing, them. If she is treated well and politely, she can easily be talked around. If not, collecting the vis is difficult, and the laboratory cannot be used.</div>

<div>Silverware of the Wastrel</div>
<div>CrTe 53 Pen 0, 6/day R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group As an exercise in the form of Terram, the founding magus Amadeus of Bonisagus enchanted an invested device highly useful for generations to come. Unfortunately, during the autumn of his life he had a tendency toward excess. The armoire creates fine silverware for a banquet setting for 50 people, including plates, bowls, goblets, candlesticks, pitchers, and serving dishes. After the meal, servants simply empty the entire table onto the midden heap, and come sunset all the silverware disappears. The device is activated simply by twisting the handles of the double cabinet doors and opening them simultaneously. Many thieves have been sorely disappointed after stealing from the table. The use of this device has given rise to stories about the magi being so rich that they never ate off the same silver plate twice, which is sort of true. Amadeus notes with humor that he does not fear lycanthropes will infiltrate the covenant, at least not at mealtimes. If using the economic system of Covenants, page 56–71, this device results in cost savings equal to two laborers. (Effect: Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Group +1 Size +1 Intricacy; Modifications +3 uses per day)</div>
<div>A New Vis Source</div>
<div>Recently a new source of Vim vis has sprung up in the hills. It is fairly easy to find for any magus actively searching the woods using Intellego Vim. The source is worth 35 Build Points.</div>
<div>Portal of Living Wood</div>
<div>Winding through the heavily forested hills a faint path ends where two trees with intertwining branches form a portal across the path. Despite appearances, this does not appear to be a regio entrance. Every autumn the hardening sap can be collected for 7 pawns of Vim vis.</div>
<div>A Missing Bookcase</div>
<div>During the Winter years of Collem Leonis, when the library was still filled to the brink with books and rolled up scrolls, the slightly absentminded Ferra attempted to be helpful and had a few grogs rearrange the chaotic mess. In the process a cabinet full of little-used texts on various spell masteries was removed from the library to a secure location in a storage room. When Ferra</div>
<div>returned from her long and arduous Twillight, she had completely forgotten about this, and the room had been cluttered with crates in the meantime. The covenant records mention the rearrangement, and it is possible to deduce that some spell mastery texts went missing at that point. As the texts themselves are not magical, they can best be found by searching the covenant. The recovered texts are as follows and sum to 101 Build Points. Helveticus of Flambeau, Scourge of the Infernal, Demon’s Eternal Oblivion Mastery Summa, Level 3, Quality 15 (24 Build Points) Maris of Flambeau, Flambeau’s Legacy, Pilum of Fire Mastery Summa, Level 4, Quality 16 (28 Build Points) Manlius of Tytalus, A Transparent State, Veil of Invisibility Mastery Summa, Level 2, Quality 15 (21 Build Points) Amadeus of Bonisagus, Arcane Travel, Piercing the Magical Veil Mastery Tractatus, Quality 14 (14 Build Points) Amadeus of Bonisagus, Fortress of the Home, Aegis of the Hearth Mastery Tractatus, Quality 14 (14 Build Points)</div>

<h3>The Covenant in Play</h3>

<div>A Second Spring covenant features many elements similar to a Spring setting: the magi are young, resources are scarce, and relationships need to be forged. However, the covenant it is built on a decaying shell and there is much immediate potential in finding lost treasure and knowledge and reforging ties all but forgotten.</div>

<h3>Covenant Themes</h3>

<div>Collem Leonis’ main theme is of an old and once-powerful place with a sense of purpose and a common cause for the magi to work together on. Metaphorically speaking, the young magi find themselves on the parapet of a ruined tower, gazing over a land of possibilities and great wonder. On the horizon loom other powers, with the potential to become allies, enemies, rivals, or possibly spell doom. If the magi put too much emphasis on rebuilding relationships. the hall falls to ruin and they have nowhere to retreat if they meet stiff opposi</div>

<div sidebars>

<h3>Story Seed: Impossible Thefts</h3>

<div>After the armoire has been found and brought back into use, someone important visits the covenant. When the meal is served, he turns red with anger and accuses the covenant of theft. It seems that someone sold him “this plate”, and then it was stolen from him in the night. When he complained about this, he found a number of other people who had suffered from the same sort of crime, and they concluded that the criminals were selling the plate, and similar silverware, and then stealing it back. The magi should quickly work out what was actually happening, but the crimes happened before they rediscovered the armoire. Who was using it for his own purposes? And what will the magi need to do to avoid taking the blame?</div>

<h3>Story Seed: A Simple Request</h3>

<div>Herr Vorderhagen informs the magi that the count of Mark is coming to visit, and asks to borrow their silverware for the necessary banquets. The messenger assures the magi that he will only keep the silver for a week. Refusing causes great problems, as Herr Vorderhagen is deeply insulted by the apparent lack of trust. Of course, the silver simply cannot be lent out for a week. What do the characters do?</div>

<h3>Story Seed: Agents Provocateurs</h3>

<div>As winter is setting in, reports come in of a band of mounted raiders pillaging along the southern border of the count of Mark’s lands, relatively close to the covenant’s domain. Scouts discover it to be made up of well-organized mercenaries who are known to have served the archbishop. They can be tracked to a fortified camp just across the border in the county of Berg, where they meet with many more of their kind. Is this an attack by the archbishop on the count of Mark, an attempt to provoke open war between them, or a scheme to draw the magi into taking an active part? The magi can find out the truth by cleverly working the courts of the respective leaders over the winter using spies and intrigue. Alternatively, they can daringly infiltrate the raider camp and try to find documents or other evidence, or kidnap the raider leader for interrogation.</div>

<h3>Story Seed: The Church Lands</h3>

<div>Count Adolph of Mark is losing in an open conflict with the Archbishop’s forces near Dortmund, and he enlists the help of Collem Leonis. Negotiating a truce is a viable solution, but Count Adolph vastly prefers to negotiate from a position of power, so any magical aid to his troops is most welcome. Archbishop Engelbert I demands lands near Dortmund, but this is a threat to the further prosperity of the free city, and it weakens the Count of Mark considerably in this area. Not only has he recently granted the city a free charter, he stands to lose much potential trade with the city should the archbishopric annex this land. The archbishop is willing to settle for an insignificant valley with untamed land bordering the county of Berg, in the southern part of the county of Mark. Count Adolph is seriously considering accepting this deal, but is it a coincidence that this land is due south of Collem Leonis’ domain? The area is to be granted to a monastic order who will tame and cultivate the land and build an abbey. The archbishop sends his trusted lieutenant Max von Beiderbecke to finalize the deal with his full authority — perhaps the magi can manipulate him? He may want power, or need supernatural help with a family problem, a mysterious illness, or a dangerous creature. For further challenges the council or burghers in Dortmund offer the count of Mark a tidy sum to add the disputed area to the lands of the free imperial city of Dortmund. This increases the power of the city, and perhaps the archbishop would be reluctant to annex lands under imperial protection?</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Enemy of My Enemy</div>
<div>The magi learn of a sinister plot against the archbishop by his cousin Count Frederick of Isenberg, but their main informant, Erich the spy, also knows that Frederick is connected with the diabolist organization in Cologne he discovered years before. No matter how aggressive the archbishop, it surely cannot be good to allow a diabolist to assassinate him. As the archbishop sets off to confront Frederick with charges of corruption at an abbey in Essen, do the magi dare act? Do they save their enemy and prolong his struggles against the count of Mark, possibly threatening the covenant’s existence? Or do they allow a diabolist nobleman to murder his own cousin and eliminate a powerful enemy, and risk even darker plots in the future?</div>

<h3>Story Seed: Old Alliances</h3>

<div>Ferra calls the younger magi to the council chamber after receiving a letter from a Redcap, and tells them they must uphold old agreements. There are several possibilities for what is demanded under the terms of these contracts. Known Wilderist hardliner Urgen chooses to make the hills into a textbook example of preservationist actions. The moderate Harmonist Prima Falke asks the resident Bjornaer magus to work more closely with the mundane relations in order to showcase her strategy. A message arrives from Waddenzee announcing that a raiding party to the coast of Norway discovered a unique creature they were asked long ago to keep a look-out for. Whatever the case may be, the young generation needs to work together and muster the resources of Collem Leonis in order to keep their part of agreements so old that barely anybody remembers the reasons or the favors done which must now be repaid.</div>
<div>Story Seed: The Army of King Gorm</div>
<div>Following a hunting season of unusually abundant magical and faerie game, which was easy to catch and in retrospect seems to have been fleeing a greater threat, Gorm the mighty Norse warrior arrives through the portal with his army. This is a powerful faerie lord playing the part of a king of the northmen who tells the magi of Collem Leonis that he is here to make good on his promises. After the initial confusion it seems a previous generation of Collem Leonis magi made a deal with Gorm by which he promised to help them for a year and a day in a battle which is by now long gone and also forgotten — although not by him. He asks Collem Leonis to name their enemy and shows a formidable knowledge of the current political situation. He assumes that the archbishop of Cologne is to be stopped in his campaign of conquest, and will not take no for an answer. However he knows nothing of magi or the Order of Hermes, and believes any magus he meets speaks for Collem Leonis. A diplomatic solution is better for the covenant than actually fighting with Gorm’s army, and a clever negotiator can convince the faerie to help in less overt and militaristic ways. This seed is appropriate for player magi based in any of the Rhine Tribunal’s covenants, as visitors can witness this situation. Will they retreat at once to avoid getting caught up in this mess, do they stay on to see whether Collem Leonis uses this opportunity, or even try to control Gorm’s army to their own ends? Magi hostile to Collem Leonis are in a prime position to remove one of their own enemies while framing Collem Leonis for the whole affair. Gorm can alter the appearance of his followers to look less like Norse warriors from several centuries ago and more like current, local forces, and he wears any heraldry they ask him to, acting out any identity they choose. Cunning plans, deception, and show of force may deter any enemies or rivals who are currently engaging in plots or campaigns that the covenant would like to disrupt without taking direct action themselves.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>tion. Too much emphasis on their home allows other forces to monopolize the area, and the covenant may be left with nothing. The uncontrolled portals tie the covenant in to the unexplored frontier of Scandinavia, good for exploring the lands, searching for the Order of Odin or other traditions, hunting for vis or magical beasts, and researching the regiones themselves. In the local area the expansion of the mundane population creates potential for more interaction with the nobility, the church, and the guilds of bustling towns. At the same time, the forgotten covenant steps from the mists of time into a struggle to claim a place and a purpose among the current Rhine covenants, most of which are much younger but more powerful.</div>
<div>Player Character Roles at Collem Leonis</div>
<div>All the young magi at Collem Leonis are appropriate as player characters, but Ferra is best kept as a troupe-controlled advisor. She is deliberately designed to intervene little, but readily offer advice as a kind grandmother would, to ensure the young generation play the most active parts in stories. In a saga the players may as well create their own magi, perhaps taking elements from the four presented to tailor them to the themes and hooks of Collem Leonis, create backgrounds to tie them together with the history and Hermetic environment, and ensure they have the abilities to handle events unfurling around the covenant. At a minimum, interest in and interaction with both the portals to Nordic lands and the growing cities and workings of nobility and clergy are essential for Collem Leonis to be used as designed.</div>
<div>Suggested Storylines</div>
<div>In the early years of Collem Leonis’ rebirth the magi are most likely busy reclaiming lost resources, developing income sources, and working on relations with the other covenants. While proactive research of the mystical portals is likely, any great threats should be decades away, due largely to the sacrifice of Scipio of Flambeau. Note that investigating</div>
<div>lesser portal events or embarking on minor expeditions is one way to go about both resource gathering and developing relations with covenants such as Waddenzee and Heorot.</div>
<div>Rebuilding Collem Leonis</div>
<div>The lost resources have been grouped together depending on how and when they were lost, and how they can be recovered.</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>Moving Collem Leonis to Other Tribunals</div>
<div>While the portals could link any part of Mythic Europe to any other, part of the theme of the covenant is interaction with other covenants in the same Tribunal that have an interest in the same unknown region, so it works best in a frontier Tribunal. Novgorod has plenty of frontier, to the east as well as Scandinavia. The Levant and Thebes have the middle east as frontier, although none of the covenants described in The Sundered Eagle have these interests. The Roman, Iberian, and Provencal Tribunals are close enough to the northern parts of Africa to classify as frontiers as well. Leaving the Rhine Tribunal means the ties to Gilds no longer apply, and all Gild related Virtues are void, meaning the magi need a slight re-design due to having less training.</div>

<h3>Lindorm of Jotunheim</h3>

<div>Magic Might: 30 (Animal) Characteristics: Int –1, Per –1, Pre –6, Com –6, Str +22, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik –12 Size: +13 Virtues and Flaws: Magic Animal; Magical Monster; Improved Characteristics (x6); Poor Communication (x2), Poor Presence Magical Qualities and Inferiorities: Gigantic (x12), Greater Power* (x4); Monstrous Appearance, Reduced Communication, Reduced Presence; Minor Flaw (Poor Presence), Reduced Might (x4) *) Blood of Venom 50 levels, Breath of Venom 70 levels, Magical Senses 80 levels Mundane Qualities and Inferiorities: Grapple, Keen Sense of Smell, Large Teeth, Loathsome Appearance, Spiny, Tough Hide, Thick Scales, Sharp Ears, Slippery, Venomous Personality Traits: Lindorm +3, Hungry for Magic +3, Angry +3 Reputations: Lethal and venomous 5 (Local, in Nordic cultures only) Combat: Grapple: Init –12, Attack +13, Defense –4, Damage +22 Large Teeth: Init –12, Attack +18, Defense –4, Damage +25 and poison (see Power: Venomous) Soak: +17 (But see Power: Scales later) Fatigue Levels: OK, 0/0/0 –1, –3, –5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: –1 (1–18), –3 (19-36), –5 (3754), Incapacitated (55-72), Dead (73+) Abilities: Awareness 5 (hearing), Brawl 6+2 (bite), Penetration 5 (blood), Survival 3 (forest), Swim 4 (speed) Powers: Blood of Venom, 0 points, always on, Animal. The lindorm’s blood is magically transformed into a sticky, corrosive venom as it leaves its body, so any grievous wound risks hurting the attacker as well. Any time a Medium or worse wound is inflicted on the lindorm the attacker must roll a Qik–Enc stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 for a Medium Wound, 12 for a Heavy Wound, or 15 for an Incapacitating Wound or worse. Other targets close by make stress rolls of Qik–Enc against a set Ease Factor of 9. Unsuccessful characters suffer +25 damage from the corrosive venom. The venom continues to inflict damage every round, at a cumulative –1 damage and also –1 Protection. Note that armor can’t have its Protection reduced below 0. This goes on until either the damage roll drops to 0, the armor is removed, the poison is removed, or two minutes have passed. Breath of Venom, 1 point, Init –14, Aquam. The lindorm may forego a bite attack and instead spew forth a sticky, venomous liquid on a target within 15 paces. The attack hits the</div>
<div>target automatically and if it Penetrates does +25 damage. The venom may spill onto nearby targets (such as other fighters in a group) for +12 damage unless they succeed in Qik–Enc roll versus an Ease Factor of 9. Constriction (non-magical): The lindorm can “constrict” targets of lower Size than itself, and can even affect multiple opponents simultaneously provided that the sum of their Sizes does not exceed +7. Targets must be successfully grappled one at a time, using the rules for “Non-Lethal Combat”, ArM5, page 174. Victims suffer Deprivation from air as long as they are constricted, ArM5, page 180. For targets of Size +2 or lower, the lindorm actually rolls over them, trapping them under its body, as they are too small for it to wrap around them effectively. Magical Senses, 0 points, always on, Vim. The lindorm’s supernatural sense of smell can find any auras, vis, enchanted devices, creatures with Might, or Gifted people within a mile. It is drawn to then in order to consume the vis, rest in the aura, fight rival beasts, or capture Gifted individuals. Scales (non-magical): The lindorm’s Soak of +17 represents the normal, average number, used for opponents in melee and for normal magical attacks. Against specially targeted attacks and heroic actions intent on hitting the soft underbelly its Soak is only +10. Such actions are left to the storyguide’s discretion but Finesse or Athletics rolls versus an Ease Factor of 12 are suggested for this. If the lindorm fortifies itself and exposes only the hardest, spiny scales, its Soak is increased to +25. This works well against massed archery attacks. Venomous (non-magical): The poisonous nature of the lindorm affects most natural traits as well. If the Attack Advantage of a bite exceeds the target’s Protection (not his Soak), he suffers a Light wound. Any combat Botch in melee also inflicts such a wound, as the target injures himself on a venomous spine. Vis: The lindorm’s heart is the source of the venom, and it holds 4 pawns of Perdo vis. The lindorm’s remaining body holds 2 pawns of Animal vis. It may have consumed any amount and type of vis during its rampage, which can be extracted from its stomach. Appearance: The lindorm is an enormous serpent with angry red eyes and a mouth full of teeth the size of greatswords. The spiny ridges are a dull, dark-green, almost black, color, the smooth scales shine in bright green hues in the light, and the softer underbelly is wrinkled and a bilious green-yellow color. It measures about 10 feet in diameter and almost 400 feet in length.</div>
</div sidebars>

<div>Story seeds concerning the rediscovery of lost resources are found earlier, in the section Hidden Resources. There are also opportunities to create new sources of income. As the Woodshed of Plenty can potentially produce as much wood as can be physically removed through the door, day and night, the real limit is transporting it to buyers and only selling in such small quantities as to ensure it is used before disappearing. The mine was in use at one point, and with the help of Ferra even a handful of low magnitude spells can substitute for a large scale mundane operation. As no trees ever need to be felled for firewood, a substantial lumber business can be established in little time. If the magi rely on mundane laborers, there are the guilds of Dortmund to think about. If the magi hire workers to mine metals, log wood, hunt game for meat and pelts, or craft items from the materials produced, the workforce is most likely recruited in or around Dortmund. The guilds have rules to be followed and taxes to be paid, and do not react mildly to being circumvented or ignored. If no local workforce is used, and the guilds are left in the dark, it is difficult to sell all the raw materials and manufactured goods without drawing suspicion, so markets further away than Dortmund need to be considered.</div>
<div>Counts and Bishops</div>
<div>The volatile power struggles between influential noblemen and the archbishop is a treasure trove of stories about the survival of the covenant as well as skirting the Code. Both the archbishop and the count of Mark know that wizards exist and of the Order of Hermes, as well as ways to contact someone in case they need to file a grievance. Secrecy is not an issue in relation to the leaders, but any situation drawing unwanted attention and leading to intervention by a military force or the Church leads to charges of meddling with the mundanes or bringing ruin to the Order. Initially, the archbishop does not know of the existence of the secluded hunting lodge or that it contains wizards, only that the area is a potentially valuable domain to add to his own. Count Adolph I suspects that the wizards can perform great feats of magic, but he prefers to keep them hidden until a critical moment, and instead tries to have them work discreetly behind the scenes.</div>
<div>Reforging Hermetic Relations</div>
<div>With the next Tribunal as soon as 1221, and the one held in advance of the Grand Tribunal in 1228, Collem Leonis is sure to be involved in Hermetic politics whether the magi want to be or not. Old enmities or poorly maintained alliances result in at least personal confrontations or even legal action, when aggrieved magi attempt to hold Collem Leonis’ magi responsible for the actions of their parens. The burning issues in these years include Prima Murion of Bonisagus’ desire for action against the Order of Odin, Daria la Gris of Triamore’s plot for forming the Lotharingian Tribunal, and the growing rift between the Harmonist and Wilderist factions of House Bjornaer.</div>
<div>Mystical Portals</div>
<div>The portals constantly affect the daily life of the magi. Because predicting events is difficult and imprecise, the magi should perpetually plan for emergencies or defensive measures. Minor portal openings or careful forays into the regiones occur frequently, but the really big events are best saved for a more established covenant, so the magi have a fighting chance.</div>
<div>Collem Leonis as a Background Covenant</div>
<div>If playing a saga where Collem Leonis suddenly appears on stage as an old covenant reborn the player magi have ample opportunity to interact with them. A Spring covenant — even if it is Second Spring — lacks resources, expertise, and manpower. This opens up missions of trade and diplomacy. There may also be old forgotten lore there to interest other magi. Old alliances and enmities are rekindled, but their new council means new negotiations. Collem Leonis’ mundane relations are of interest to Triamore especially, given its proximity. Finally the older generations’ research into the Nordic lands is of interest to Heorot, Waddenzee, and Oculus Septentrionalis, while at the same time interfering with their spheres of interest. Collem Leonis can also draw other covenants into its story as it follows the lines described earlier, and the player characters can be drawn in as allies, enemies, or even as visitors who just happen to be present when something interesting happens.</div>

<div sidebars>
<div>Story Seed: The Ravens Fly Again</div>
<div>Scouts observe a large flock of ravens that seem to appear out of nowhere over the woods moving toward Dortmund, and disappear just as the first raven crosses the edge of the city. In a saga set in Collem Leonis the player magi have a chance to do research or ask the old resident maga. Ferra claims from the first moment that this is a bad omen, that it has happened before, and it spelled great disaster. It was over a century ago, so she can offer no more detail, but the Collem Leonis chronicles can. Outside magi are less privileged. While they may recognize the ravens as an ill omen, only a visit to Collem Leonis yields advance warning before disaster strikes. Successful research indicates that this is a warning of an imminent attack of a lindorm who seeks magical resources to consume and hoard. The most recent occurrence was actually quite recent, while Ferra was in Twilight, and Scipio of the previous generation went to stop it. Since no lindorm attacked he must have been successful, but he did not return. The swarming ravens mark the birth of the beast from the very earth, and their movements predict the path of its coming rampage. How long before the beast attacks the old texts cannot say, so perhaps the magi should mount a pre-emptive strike and kill the worm before it is fully grown? This means venturing into its domain inside the Magical regio and facing great danger. The old texts claim it is drawn to valuable magical resources, but is unclear if this is vis, Gifted children, a regio entrance, or something else entirely. Scouts sent to observe it may try to judge how much time will pass before the lindorm bursts forth from the portal, provided they have some knowledge of magical beasts. The magi may have anywhere from a single season to several years to prepare, as appropriate for the saga. Magi from outside Collem Leonis are unlikely to know of the lindorm before it enters the mundane realm, but once it does stories about interaction with the magi of Collem Leonis are appropriate. With little change to the story the ravens can as easily show a path to a location other than Dortmund, be it one of the neighboring covenants or a major mundane settlement of interest to one of them. Even once it is on the move, the lindorm may stop along the way to consume vis found at sites or in animals caught, and burrow down to digest it, even for months at a time, allowing the magi more time for preparation as the lindorm grows ever larger. The lindorm has skin impervious to swords and spears save for its softer underbelly, can crush even the mightiest warriors with its sheer weight or rend then with its fangs, spews lethal venom, has corrosive blood, and is large enough to encircle a castle. Having this monster lay siege to the covenant seriously hampers daily activities, and if it follows the path of the ravens to Dortmund the collateral damage and unwanted attention is hard to remedy.</div>
